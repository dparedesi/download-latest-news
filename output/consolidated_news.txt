Title: The Slop Society

Time Published: 2025-01-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In the last week we've seen the emergence of the true Meta — and the true Mark Zuckerberg — as the company ended its fact-checking program, claiming that (and I quote) "fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created" on both Instagram and Facebook, the latter of which was shown in a study from George Washington University to, by design, "afford antivaccine content producers several means to circumvent the intent of misinformation removal policies." Meta has also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Shortly after announcing the policies, Zuckerberg went on the Joe Rogan Experience and had a full-scale pissfit, claiming that corporations are "culturally neutered" and that companies should have both "more masculine energy" and "[have a culture] that celebrates the aggression a bit more," adding that said culture would "[have] its own merits that are really positive." Zuckerberg believes that modern corporate culture has somehow framed masculinity as bad, something he does not attempt to elaborate upon, frame with any kind of evidence (after all, it's Joe Rogan), or really connect to anything besides a sense of directionless grievance. This means that Meta has now "[gotten rid of] a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate," which in practice means that Meta now allows you to say that being gay is a mental illness or describe immigrants as "filth." Casey Newton at Platformer — who I have been deeply critical of (and will be later in this piece!) — has done an excellent job reporting on exactly how horrifying these policies are, revealing how Meta's internal guidelines allow Facebook users to say that trans people are both mentally ill and don't exist (to be clear, if you feel this way, stop reading and take a quick trip to the garage with your car keys), and included one of the most wretched things I've ever read: that Alex Schultz, Meta's CMO, a gay man, "suggested in an internal post that people seeing their queer friends and family members abused on Facebook and Instagram could lead to increased support for LGBTQ rights." This is the kind of social network that Mark Zuckerberg wants — an unrestrained, unfiltered, unrepentantly toxic and noxiously heteronormative, one untethered by the frustrating norms of "making sure that a social network of billions of people doesn't actively encourage hate of multiple different marginalized groups." Finally, Mark Zuckerberg can do whatever he wants, as opposed to the past 20 years, where it's hard to argue that he's faced an unrelenting series of punishments. Zuckerberg's net worth recently hit $213 billion, he's running a company with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion that he can never be fired from, he owns a 1400-acre compound in Hawaii, and while dealing with all this abject suffering, he was forced to half-heartedly apologize during a senate hearing where he was tortured (translation: made to feel slightly uncomfortable) after only having six years to recover from the last time when nothing happened to him in a senate hearing. Sarcasm aside, few living people have had it easier than Mark Zuckerberg, a man who has been insulated from consequence, risk, and responsibility for nearly twenty years. The sudden (and warranted) hysteria around these monstrous changes has an air of surprise, framing Meta (and Zuckerberg's) moves as a "MAGA-tilt" to "please Donald Trump," which I believe is a comfortable way to frame a situation that is neither sudden nor surprising. Mere months ago, the media was fawning over Mark Zuckerberg's new look, desperate to hear about why he's wearing gold chains, declaring that he had "the swagger of a Roman emperor" and that he had (and I quote the Washington Post) transformed himself from "a dorky, democracy-destroying CEO into a dripped-out, jacked AI accelerationist in the eyes of potential Meta recruits." Zuckerberg was, until this last week, being celebrated for the very thing people are upset about right now — flimsy, self-conscious and performative macho bullshit that only signifies strength to weak men and those credulous enough to accept it, which in this case means "almost every major media outlet." The only thing he did differently this time was come out and say it. After all, there was no punishment or judgment for his last macho media cycle, and if anything he proved that many will accept whatever he says in whatever way he does it. Yet I want to be clear that what you're seeing with Meta — and by extension Zuckerberg — is not a "sudden" move, but the direct result of a man that has never, ever been held in check. It is a fantasy to describe — or even hint — that these changes are the beginning of some sort of unrestrained Meta, rather than part of the intentional destruction of the market leader in growth-at-all-costs Rot Economics. As I wrote in the middle of last year, Meta has spent years gradually making the experience of using its products worse in pursuit of perpetual growth. When I say "intentionally," I mean that product decisions — such as limiting the information in notifications as a means of making users and heavily promoting clickbait headlines as a means of keeping people on the site longer — have been made for years, at times in broad daylight, that have led to the deterioration of the core experiences of both Facebook and Instagram. Some are touting Zuckerberg's current move as some sort of master plan to appease Trump and conservatives, suggesting that this is a "MAGA-fication" of these platforms, where conservatives will somehow be given preferential treatment, such as, say, Facebook's recommendation engine promoting dramatically more conservative media than other sources. Which is something that already fucking happened! In 2020, journalist Kevin Roose created an automated Twitter account called "Facebook's Top 10," listing the top-performing (as in what posts were shared, viewed and commented on the most) link posts by U.S. Facebook pages on a daily basis, something he was able to do by connecting to Facebook's "CrowdTangle" data analytics tool, a product created for researchers and journalists to understand what was happening on the world's largest social network. Roose's reporting revealed that Meta's top-performing links regularly skewed toward right wing influencers like Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro and Sean Hannity, outlets like Fox News, and the page of president-elect Donald Trump. Internally, Meta was freaking out, suggesting to Roose that "engagement" was a misleading measurement of what was popular on Facebook, suggesting the real litmus test being "reach," as in how many people saw it. Roose also reported that internal arguments at Meta led it to suggesting it’d make a Twitter account of its own that had a more "balanced" view based on internal data. Meta even suggested the obvious answer — sharing reach data — would vindicate its position, only for CrowdTangle's CEO to add that "false and misleading news stories also rose to the top of those lists." These stories danced around one important detail: that these stories were likely recommended by Facebook's algorithm, which has reliably and repeatedly skewed conservative for many years. A study in The Economist from September 2020 found that the most popular American media outlets on Facebook in a one month period were Breitbart and Fox News, and that both Facebook page engagements and website views heavily skewed conservative. While one could argue that this might be the will of the users, what a user sees on Facebook is almost entirely algorithmic, and thus it's reasonable to assume that said algorithm was deliberately pushing conservative content. At this time, Meta's Head of Public Policy was Joel Kaplan, a man whose previous work involved working as George W. Bush's Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, as well as handling public policy and affairs for Energy Future Holdings, which involved three private equity firms buying Texas power company TXU for $45 billion and immediately steering it into bankruptcy due to the $38.7 billion in debt Energy Future Holdings was forced to take on as a means of acquiring TXU. Jeff Horwitz reports in his book Broken Code that Kaplan personally intervened when Facebook's health team attempted to remove COVID conspiracy movie Plandemic from its recommendation engine, and Facebook only did so once Roose reported that it was the most-engaged link in a 24 hour period. Naturally, Meta's choice wasn't to "fix things" or "improve" or "take responsibility." By the end of 2021, Meta had disbanded the team that ran CrowdTangle, and in early 2022, the company had stopped registering new users. In early 2024 — months before the 2024 elections — CrowdTangle was officially shut down, though Facebook Top 10 had stopped working in the middle of 2023. Meta hasn't "made a right-wing turn." It’s been an active arm of the right wing media for nearly a decade, actively empowering noxious demagogues like Alex Jones, allowing him to evade bans and build massive private online groups on the platform to disseminate content. A report from November 2021 by Media Matters found that Facebook had tweaked its news algorithm in 2021, helping right-leaning news and politics pages to outperform other pages using "sensational and divisive content." Another Media Matters report from 2023 found that conservatives were continually earning more total interactions than left or non-aligned pages between January 1 2020 and December 31 2022, even as the company was actively deprioritizing political content. A 2024 report from non-profit GLAAD found that Meta had continually allowed widespread anti-trans hate content across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, with the company either claiming that the content didn't violate its community standards or ignoring reports entirely. While we can — and should — actively decry Meta's disgusting new standards, it's ahistorical to pretend that this was a company that gave a shit about any of this stuff, or took it seriously, or sought to protect marginalized people. It's a testament to the weak and inconsistent approach that the media has taken to both Meta and Mark Zuckerberg that any of these changes are being framed as anything other than Meta formalizing the quiet reality of its platforms: that whatever gets engagement is justified, even if it's hateful, racist, violent, cruel, or bigoted. To quote Facebook's then-Vice President Andrew Bosworth in an internal email from 2017, "all the work that [Facebook] does in growth is justified," even if it's bullying, or a terrorist attack, and yes, that's exactly what he said. One might think that Bosworth would be fired for sending this email. He's now Meta's Chief Technology Officer. It's time to stop pretending that this company was ever something noble, or good, or well-meaning. Mark Zuckerberg is a repressed coward, as far from "manly" as one can get, because true masculinity is a sense of responsibility for both oneself and others, and finding strength in supporting and uplifting them with sincerity and honesty. Meta, as an institution, has been rotten for years, making trillions of dollars as it continually makes the service worse, all to force users to spend more time on the site, even if it's because Facebook and Instagram are now engineered to interrupt users' decisionmaking and autonomy with a constant slew of different forms of sponsored and algorithmicly-curated content. The quality of the experience — something the media has categorically failed in covering — has never been lower on either Facebook or Instagram. I am not sure how anyone writing about this company for the last few years has been able to do so with a straight face. The products suck, they're getting worse, and yet the company has never been more profitable. Facebook is crammed with fake accounts, AI-generated slop, and nonsense groups teeming with boomers posting that they "wish we'd return to a culture of respect" as they're recommended their third racist meme of the day. Instagram is a carousel of screen-filling sponsored and recommended content, and users are constantly battling with these products to actually see the things that they log on to see. I want to be explicit here: for years, using Facebook has been a nightmare for many, many years. And, to repeat myself, this has been the case for years. Meta has been gradually (yet aggressively) reducing the quality of the Facebook and Instagram experience with utter disregard for user safety, all while flagrantly ignoring its own supposed quality and safety standards. It's a comfortable lie to say that Meta has "suddenly" done something, because it gives the media (and society at large) air cover for ignoring a gaping wound in the internet. Two of the world's largest social networks are run — and have been run — with a blatant contempt for the user, misinforming and harming people at scale, making the things they want to see harder to find as they're swamped by an endless stream of sponsored and recommended content that either sells them something or gets them to engage further with the platform with little care whether the engagement is positive, fun or useful. Casey Newton of Platformer has done an admirable job covering Meta in the last two weeks, but it's important to note that he was cheerfully covering Zuckerberg's "expansive view of the future" as recently as September 25, 2024, happily publishing how "Zuckerberg was back on the offensive," somehow not seeing anything worrying about Zuckerberg's t-shirt referencing Julius Caesar, the historic dictator that perpetuated a genocide in the Gallic wars. Newton felt it unnecessary to mention the utterly atrocious quality of Facebook while quoting Zuck saying things like "in every generation of technology, there is a competition of ideas for what the future should look like." Yet the most loathsome thing Newton published was this: This is paper tiger analysis — stenography for the powerful, masked as deep thoughts. This specific paragraph is exactly where Newton could've said something about how worrying Zuckerberg modeling himself on a Roman emperor was. How this company was, despite oinking about how it’s building the future, letting its existing products deteriorate as it deliberately turned the screws to juice engagement. Casey Newton has regularly and reliably turned his back on the truth — that Meta's core products are really quite bad — in favor of pumping up various artificial intelligence products and vague promises about a future that just arrived and fucking sucks. The reason I am singling Newton out is that it is very, very important to hold the people that helped Zuckerberg succeed accountable, especially as they attempt to hint that they've always been an aggressive advocate for the truth. Newton is fully capable of real journalism — as proven by his recent coverage — but has chosen again and again to simply print whatever Mark Zuckerberg wants to say. I am also going hard in the paint against Newton because of something else he wrote at the end of last year — "The phony comforts of AI skepticism" — where Newton sloppily stapled together multiple different pieces of marketing collateral to argue that not only was AI the future, but those that critiqued it were doing so in a cynical, corrupt way, singling out independent critic Gary Marcus. I'm not going to go through it in detail — Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so — but I think there are far better comforts for Newton than his ambiguous yet chummy relationship with the powerful. I also did not like something Newton said at the end of a (paywalled) blog about what he learned from the reaction to his piece about AI skeptics. Newton said, and I quote, that he was "taking detailed notes on all bloggers writing ’financial analyses’ suggesting that OpenAI will go bankrupt soon because it's not profitable yet." I do not like bullies, and I do not like threats. Suggesting one is "taking detailed notes on bloggers" is an attempt to intimidate people that are seriously evaluating the fact that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year and has no path to profitability. I don't know if this is about me, nor do I particularly care. I have, however, been taking detailed notes on Casey Newton for quite some time. While Newton's metaverse interview from 2021 was deeply irresponsible in how much outright nonsense it printed, arguably his most disgraceful was his October 26 2021 piece called "The Facebook Papers' missing piece" — an interview with an anonymous "integrity worker" that attempted to undermine the Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files (that revealed in that "Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands"), in a seeming attempt to discredit (by proxy) the bravery of Frances Haugen, the whistleblower that provided the documents that led to this reporting. It's utterly repulsive corporate hand-washing, and it's important context for any criticism he has of Meta going forward, especially if he tries to suggest he's always held it to account. I think Newton seems a little more comfortable with the powerful's messaging than he should. He's argued that while AI companies have hit a scaling wall, it's actually okay, that NFTs went finally mainstream in 2022, that Clubhouse was the future, that live audio was Zuckerberg's "big bet on creators" in 2021 due to "the shift in power from institutions to individuals" (Facebook shut down its podcast service a year later), that — and I cannot see the full text here, because it's paywalled — "metaverse pessimists were missing something" because "Meta's grand vision [was] already well on its way" in November 2021, that Meta's leadership changed its mind about its name because "Facebook [was] not the future of the company," that Axie Infinity — a crypto/web3 Pokémon clone that has created its own form of indentured servitude in the global south backed by Andreessen Horowitz — was "turning gaming on its head" (the game sucks)...okay, I'll stop. Casey has also, at times, had dalliances with criticisms — sometimes even of Facebook! No, really! — but it's hard to take them seriously when he writes a piece for The Verge about how "Google plans to win its antitrust trial," printing the legal and marketing opinion of one of the largest companies in the world knowing full-well that the Department of Justice would not get such an opportunity. In emails revealed in the Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Google Search, Google specifically mentioned having briefed Newton with the intention of, and I quote, "look[ing] for ways to drive headlines on [Google's] own terms." In Newton's defense, this is standard PR language, but it is, within the context of what I'm writing, hard to ignore. The reason I am so fucking furious at Newton is he is part of the media machine that has helped repeatedly whitewash Mark Zuckerberg and his cronies, running glossy puff-pieces with scumbags like Nick Clegg, and saying things like "the transition away from Facebook’s old friends and family-dominated feeds to Meta’s algorithmic wonderland seems to be proceeding mostly without incident." That line, I add, was published in 2023, two years after the release of The Facebook Files, which revealed that the company knew its algorithmic timeline had a propensity to push users into increasingly-radical echo chambers. And one year after Amnesty International published a report accusing Facebook’s algorithms of “supercharging the spread of harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar” amidst a genocide that saw an estimated million displaced and tens of thousands massacred. Newton has spent years using his vast platform to subtly defend companies actively making their products worse, occasionally proving he can be a real journalist (his work on the acquisition of Twitter was genuinely great), only to slip back into the comfortable pajamas of "Are We Being Too Mean To Meta?" The media — especially people like Newton — are extremely influential over public policy and the overall way that society views the tech industry. As an experienced, knowledgeable journalist, Newton has too regularly chosen to frame "fair and balanced" as "let's make sure the powerful get their say too." As I've said — and will continue to say — Casey Newton is fully capable of doing some of the literal best journalism in tech, such as his coverage of the horrible lives of Facebook moderators, yet has, up until alarmingly recently, chosen to do otherwise. The cost, by the way, is that the powerful have used Newton and others as mouthpieces to whitewash their contemptuous and half-baked product decisions. I don't know Newton's intentions, nor will I attempt to guess at them. What I will say is that as a result of Casey Newton's work, Mark Zuckerberg and his products have received continual promotion of their ideas and air cover for their failures, directly influencing public opinion in the process. Worse still, Newton has acted for years like nothing was wrong with the quality of platforms themselves. Had Newton written with clarity and purpose about the erosion of quality in Facebook and Instagram, Zuckerberg would have lost a valuable way to convince the 150,000+ people that read Platformer that things were fine, that the quality was fine, that Meta is an innovative company, and that there was no reason to dislike Mark Zuckerberg. There was, and there always will be. Putting aside the horrifying person he obviously is, Zuckerberg is a career liar and a charlatan, and has deliberately made the lives of billions of people worse as a means of increasing revenue growth. And I believe that he's about to inspire a new era of decay, where tech executives, unburdened by their already-flimsy approach to societal norms and customer loyalty, will begin degrading experiences at scale, taking as many liberties as possible. Meta has fired the starting gun of the Slop Society. In an interview with the Financial Times from December 2024, Meta's Vice President of Product for Generative AI (Connor Hayes) said that Meta "expect[s] AIs to actually, over time, exist on [Meta's] platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do," each one having their own bios and profile pictures and the ability to "generate and share content powered by AI on the platform." This came hot off the heels of Zuckerberg saying in a quarterly earnings call that Meta would "...add a whole new category of content, which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way," effectively promising to drop AI slop into feeds already filled full of recommended and sponsored content that gets in the way of you seeing real human beings. This led to a scandal where users discovered what they believed to be brand new AI profiles. Karen Attiah of the Washington Post wrote a long thread on Bluesky (and a piece in the post itself) about her experience talking to a bot she (fairly!) described as "digital blackface," with Meta receiving massive backlash for bots that would happily admit they were trained by a bunch of white people. It turns out these bots had been around for around a year in various forms but were so unpopular that nobody really noticed until the Financial Times story, leading to Meta deleting the bots, at least for now. I am 100% sure that these chatbots will return, because it's fairly obvious that Meta intends to fill your feeds with content either entirely generated or summarized by generative AI, be it with fake profiles or content itself. AI-generated slop already dominates the platform, and as discussed earlier, the quality of the platform has fallen into utter disrepair, mostly because Meta's only concern is keeping you on the platform to show you ads or content it’s been paid to show you, even if the reason you're seeing it is because you can't find the stuff you actually want to find. That's because all roads lead back to the Rot Economy — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that means that the only thing that matters is growth of revenue, which comes from showing as many ads to you as possible. It's almost ridiculous to call us "users" of Facebook at this point. We are the used, the punished, the terrorized, the tricked, the scammed, and the abused, constantly forced to navigate through layers of abstraction between the thing we are allegedly using and the features we'd like to use. It's farcical how little attention has been given to how bad tech products have gotten, and few have decayed as severely as Facebook thanks to its near-monopoly on social media. I, personally, would rather not use Instagram, but there are people I know that I only really speak to there, and I know many people who have the same experience. As Zuckerberg and his ilk are intimately aware, people really don't have anywhere else to go, which — along with a lack of regulation and a compliant media — has given them permission to adjust their services to increase advertising impressions, which in practice means giving you more reasons to stay on the platforms, which means "put more things in the way of what you want to see" rather than "create more compelling experiences for users." It's the same thing that happened with Google Search, where the revenue team pushed the search team to make search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times people searched for things on Google — because a user that finds what they're looking for quickly spends less time on the site looking at ads. It's why the Apple App Store is so chaotically-organized and poorly-curated — Apple makes money on the advertising impressions it gets from you searching — and why so many products on the App Store have expensive and exploitative microtransactions, because Apple makes 30% off of all App Store revenue, even if the app sucks. And I believe that Zuckerberg loosening community standards and killing fact checking is just the beginning of tech's real era of decay. Trump, and by extension those associated with him, win in part by bulldozing norms and good taste. They do things that most of us agree are bad (such as being noxious and cruel, which I realize is a dilution) and would never do, moving the Overton window (the range of acceptable things in a society) further and further into Hell in the process. In this case, we've already seen tech's Overton window shift for years — a lack of media coverage of the actual decay of these products and a lack of accountability for tech executives (both in the media and regulation) has given companies the permission to quietly erode their services, and because everybody made things shittier over time, it became accepted practice to punish and trick customers with dark patterns (design choices to intentionally mislead people) to the point that the FTC found last year that the majority of subscription apps and websites use them. I believe, however, that Zuckerberg is attempting to move it further — to publicly say "we're going to fill your feeds with AI slop" and "we're firing 5% of our workers because they suck" and "we're going to have AI profiles instead of real people on the site you visit to see real people's stuff" and "we don't really give a shit about marginalized people" and "people are too mean to men" knowing, in his position as the CEO of one of the largest tech companies in the world, that people will follow. Tech has already taken liberties with the digital experience and I believe the Slop Era will be one where experiences will begin to subtly and overtly rot, with companies proudly boasting that they're making "adjustments to user engagement that will provide better business-forward outcomes," which will be code for "make them worse so that we make more money." I realize that there's an obvious thing I'm not saying: that the Trump administration isn't going to be any kind of regulatory force against big tech. Trump is perhaps the most transactional human being ever to grace the earth. Big tech, knowing this, has donated generously to the Trump inaugural fund. It’s why Trump has completely reversed his position on TikTok, having once wanted to ban the platform, now wants to give it a reprieve because he “won youth by 34 points” and “there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” Tech knows that by kissing the ring, it can do whatever it wants. Not that previous governments have been effective at curbing the worst excesses of big tech. Outside of the last few years, and specifically the work done by the FCC under Lina Khan, antitrust against big tech has been incredibly weak, and no meaningful consumer protections exist to keep websites like Facebook or Google functional for consumers, or limit how exploitative they can be. The media has failed to hold them accountable at scale, which has in turn allowed the Overton window to shift on quality, and now that Trump — and the general MAGAfied mindset of "you can say or do whatever you want if you do so confidently or loudly enough" — has risen to power again, so too will an era of outright selfishness and cruelty within the products that consumers use every day, except this time I believe they finally have permission to enter their slop era. I also think that Trump gives them confidence that monopolies like Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft 365 (Microsoft's enterprise monopoly over business productivity software), Google Search, and Google Advertising (remedies will take some time, and the Trump administration will likely limit any punishment it inflicts) will remain unchallenged. What I'm describing is an era of industrial contempt for the consumer, a continuation of what I described in Never Forgive Them, where big tech decides that they will do whatever they want to customers within the boundaries of the law, but with little consideration of good taste, user happiness, or anything other than growth. How this manifests in Facebook and Instagram will be fairly obvious. I believe that the already-decrepit state of these platforms will accelerate. Meta will push as much AI slop as it wants, both created by its generative models and their users, and massively ramp up content that riles up users with little regard for the consequences. Instagram will become more exploitative and more volatile. Instagram ads have been steadily getting more problematic, and I think Meta will start taking ads from just about anyone. This will lead to an initial revenue bump, and then, I hypothesize, a steady bleed of users that will take a few quarters to truly emerge. Elsewhere, we're already seeing the first sign of abusive practices. Both Google and Microsoft are now forcing generative AI features onto customers, with Google grifting business users by increasing the cost of Google Workspace by $2-per-user-per-month along with AI features they don't want, and Microsoft raising the price of consumer Office subscriptions, justifying the move by adding Copilot AI features that, again, customers really don't want. The Information's Jon Victor and Aaron Holmes add that it's yet to be seen what Microsoft does with the corporate customers using Microsoft's 365 productivity suite — adding Copilot costs $30-per-user-per-month — but my hypothesis is it will do exactly the same thing that Google did to its business customers. I should also be clear that the reason they're doing this is that they're desperate. These companies must express growth every single quarterly earnings or see their stock prices crater, and big tech companies have oriented themselves around growth as a result — meaning that they're really not used to having to compete for customers or make products they like. For over a decade, tech has been rewarded for creating growth opportunities empowered by monopolistic practices, and I'd argue that the cultures that created the products that people remember actually liking are long-dead, their evangelists strangled by the soldiers of the Rot Economy. You are, more than likely, already seeing the signs that this is happening. The little features on the products you use that feel broken — like when you try and crop an image on iOS and it sometimes doesn't actually crop it, when the "copy link" button on Google Docs doesn't work, when a Google Search gives you a page of forum links that don't answer your question — and I expect things to get worse, possibly in new and incredibly frustrating ways. I deeply worry that we're going to enter the most irresponsible era of tech yet — not just in the harms that companies allow or perpetuate, but in the full rejection of their stewardship for the products themselves. Our digital lives are already chaotic and poisonous, different incentives warring for our attention, user interfaces corroded by those who believe everything is justified in pursuit of growth. I fear that the subtle little problems you see every day will both multiply and expand, and that the core services we use will break down, because I believe the most powerful in big tech never really gave a shit and no longer believe they have to pretend otherwise.

Title: TikTok stops working for US users, disappears from Apple, Google stores

Print TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. Users move to alternatives Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users -- mostly younger people -- scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. "This is my new home now," wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words "tiktokrefugee" and "sad." Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. "I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days," wrote @RavenclawJedi. NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was "experiencing temporary technical difficulties." Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S. Reuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada. One of the world's largest wire services, it provides financial news as well as international coverage in over 16 languages to more than 1000 newspapers and 750 broadcasters around the globe.

Title: Is corporate America going Maga?
Donald Trump’s election has accelerated a cultural shift in the nation’s boardrooms

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/18/2025 8:35:58 PM PST by DoodleBob Last week Amazon announced plans to release a “behind the scenes” documentary about Melania Trump, produced by the incoming US first lady herself. The tech giant reportedly paid $40mn for the exclusive deal just weeks after it donated $1mn to her husband Donald Trump’s inauguration committee and committed to livestreaming the ceremony on its Prime service. Before November’s presidential election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also cancelled plans for The Washington Post, which he owns, to endorse Trump’s Democratic rival. Shortly after the election, he spoke favourably about Trump’s “energy around reducing regulation” and made a personal pilgrimage to have dinner with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Bezos’s rush to cosy up to the Trumps has been matched by corporate executives across America, as tech billionaires, financiers and the leaders of some of the US’s best-known consumer groups hurry to adjust to a more conservative zeitgeist in the wake of Trump’s election victory and the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress. In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Shortly after the election, he spoke favourably about Trump’s “energy around reducing regulation” and made a personal pilgrimage to have dinner with the incoming president at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Bezos’s rush to cosy up to the Trumps has been matched by corporate executives across America, as tech billionaires, financiers and the leaders of some of the US’s best-known consumer groups hurry to adjust to a more conservative zeitgeist in the wake of Trump’s election victory and the Republican sweep of both houses of Congress. In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In a mirror image of the 2020 corporate rush to support social justice causes after the murder of George Floyd by a policeman, companies today are reshaping the way they interact with their customers, employees and society at large. Some of the moves, such as the parade of CEOs visiting Trump in Florida, the donations, and the effort to do business with people in his inner circle, appear designed to curry favour with a man famous for attacking companies and executives he dislikes. But the election has also accelerated a wider shift back to more conservative social and political stances and an embrace of unfettered capitalism. Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Companies are scrapping diversity, equity and inclusion departments, cutting their support for racial diversity charities, and dropping out of climate change groups. They are also scrubbing anything that could be perceived as “woke” from public statements, corporate documents and advertising. The election has empowered some top executives to start speaking out in favour of conservative policies, from tax cuts to traditional gender roles. “There are conservative pressures in this political climate, and folks are just anticipating a change in the administration and . . . aligning their strategies with these expected policy shifts,” said Trier Bryant, a former DEI executive at Goldman Sachs and Twitter. Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Last week, social media group Meta exemplified all the developments at once. It dropped its content moderation policies, added longtime Trump friend and Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White to its board, shifted its chief diversity officer to a new role, and dropped its goals to boost racial and gender diversity among its managers and suppliers. Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Founder Mark Zuckerberg later joined a podcast hosted by Joe Rogan, who backed Trump in the election, and lamented the rise of “culturally neutered” companies. “I think having a culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive,” Zuckerberg said. Liberal politicians and investor activists are appalled. “Corporate caving to Trump is deeply distressing,” said Brad Lander, New York City comptroller and an advocate for sustainable investing. “We have seen too many examples through history. That, over time, is how democracy and fundamental rights are weakened.” But companies, executives and analysts contend that the motives driving the changes are complex and reflect far more than a desire to pander to the incoming president. The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

The mood among their customers has changed, executives argue, and court rulings and state and federal regulatory probes, notably last year’s US Supreme Court ruling outlawing affirmative action in colleges, have undercut the footing of diversity and climate programmes. For many, the new administration offers a welcome opportunity to roll back some of the tighter rules enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration and bend tax and regulatory policy in their favour. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently praised the incoming Trump administration for “running a growth-y playbook”. “I am quite optimistic that this administration is going to run a very, very pro-growth agenda,” Solomon said at a Reuters event. Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Tech leaders have made some of the highest-profile gestures towards Trump and conservative values in a pre-emptive effort to mend fences. Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman all joined Meta’s Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Bezos in pledging $1mn to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Pichai also flew to Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously claimed Google was “rigged” to hide positive coverage about him. “It is a statement of the lack of confidence and backbone of tech executives,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He described their contributions to Trump’s inauguration as a “tithing scheme” to the president-elect. In the financial sector, the most visible shift since Trump’s election has been around climate change. All the major Wall Street banks and several big money managers have quit industry groups that seek to use their financial clout to cut carbon emissions. BlackRock, the target of conservative state probes and lawsuits over its prior support for sustainable investing, explicitly cited legal and regulatory issues for its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last week. Even the way people on Wall Street talk and interact is changing. Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”.

Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Bankers and financiers say Trump’s victory has emboldened those who chafed at “woke doctrine” and felt they had to self-censor or change their language to avoid offending younger colleagues, women, minorities or disabled people. “I feel liberated,” said a top banker. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pus*y’ without the fear of getting cancelled . . . it’s a new dawn.” Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly, without nodding to any broader social goals. “Most of us don’t have to kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,” one said. Consumer-facing groups, meanwhile, have become increasingly careful to avoid seeming “woke”, less they trigger the kind of boycotts faced by Target and Bud Light over marketing that celebrated gay and transgender people. That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

That backlash was under way well before the election. But the shift to the right has been so rapid that some groups have been caught out. After the recent New Orleans terrorist attack, the chief executive of insurance group Allstate, Tom Wilson, drew a firestorm of criticism for saying “we need to be stronger together by overcoming an addiction to divisiveness and negativity”. Conservative activists accused Wilson, whose company was sponsoring a high-profile American football game in the city, of minimising murder while pushing progressive causes. Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion.

Allstate tried to explain that the statement “reflects a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity in communities across the nation”. The other big corporate shift has been on DEI efforts, particularly since the Supreme Court’s ruling against the use of race-based college admissions in June 2023. Companies including Harley-Davidson, Ford and Molson Coors began rolling back their corporate diversity in the months after the decision, and the trickle became a flood after Trump’s election victory. Walmart stopped considering race and gender in granting supplier contracts, ended racial equity training for staff, and will not renew funding for the Center for Racial Equity, which it set up with a $100mn pledge after the Floyd protests. McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

McDonald’s last week dropped percentage goals for women and non-white managers, ceased asking suppliers to sign a DEI pledge and said it would now refer to its diversity team as a Global Inclusion Team. Both companies pointed to legal issues but also changing circumstances. McDonald’s cited “an evolving landscape”, while saying it was committed to inclusion. Walmart said its shifting approach showed “we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging.” Consultants and other corporate advisers said the shifting landscape had also given companies a way to rethink or scrap environmental and diversity goals that they were not meeting anyway. “They don’t want to be caught out promising and not delivering,” said Richard Edelman, who counsels corporate leaders as chief executive of Edelman, a public relations group. “Companies are still committed to diversity and they’re committed to inclusion, they just don’t want to guarantee outcomes.” It is not clear whether the conservative turn will last any longer than the progressive positions companies put forward in 2020. Bryant, the former DEI executive who is now the chief executive of consulting firm Pathfinder, said many of the policy reversals seemed to be aimed at alleviating political scrutiny rather than substantive policy changes. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When people show you who they are, believe them.’ When companies show you who they are, believe them as well,” she said TOPICS: Business/Economy; Culture/Society; News/Current Events KEYWORDS: corporations; maga; wokism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Title: Jim Cramer Says GE Vernova Inc. (GEV) Will Probably Build Small Nuclear Reactors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said "Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher." He added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer "I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't." He added "And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal." The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated "you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time. Returning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him "The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed." As for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's "Not enough talk about the fires." The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined "I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma." Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added "But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results." One industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, "Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done." He added "And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy." The CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. "Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready." Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, "But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower." Cramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him "Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against" the iPhone designer. He added "It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded "Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. . .it's a libertarian love fest." As for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented "Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun." However, Cramer added, "At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having." He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer: "And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired recently For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An aerial view of the energy producing facility, highlighting its potential of providing utilities to the public. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is an energy company that operates in the power generation and electrification industries. It is also among the handful of firms capable of manufacturing nuclear power reactors. The exposure has served GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) well since the stock is up by a whopping 205% over the past year. The strong share price performance is due to the AI data center industry's thirst for clean power generation which has grown the demand for nuclear power. Cramer, however, isn't a believer in the near-term potential of nuclear power; but, at the same time, he's a fan of GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV): "The company that would probably build them [small nuclear reactors] here is GE Vernova. They don't really have a game plan to do anything before twenty, uh, thirty two." Overall GEV ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."

Title: After Donald Trump’s win, global ETF flows brike record, hitting US$1.5 trillion in 2024

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The 2024 year set another record for global exchange traded funds. Global exchange traded fund flows hit a record US$1.5 trillion ($2.7 trillion) last year with the buying frenzy accelerating after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November. The net inflows obliterated the previous full-year record of $1.2t set in 2021 according to data from Morningstar, which includes most major investment markets except China and India. Total assets hit $13.8t, a rise of $2.7t during the year, and nearly five times the $2.9 billion level of a decade ago. Both equity and fixed income funds saw record inflows, with these two asset classes accounting for 95% of flows between them, despite an industry focus on alternative assets such as bitcoin. The record year is a reflection of the lure of rising markets, with many major equity benchmarks hitting record highs last year. It also highlights the ongoing switch away from the century-old mutual fund format to the lower cost and greater transparency, liquidity and convenience of ETFs. This is particularly true in the US where ETFs also have significant tax advantages. “ETFs are going gangbusters,” said Syl Flood, senior product manager at Morningstar. “Inflation-adjusted returns on short-term bond products, especially for US investors, are back to where they were before rates started rising, so it’s back to Tina [there is no alternative] to equities.” “ETFs seem to have a bit of a halo around them,” Flood added. “People want the ETF version of a strategy, if they can get it. The halo has been earned. ETFs have been great tools for helping investors reach their goals.” Flows peaked at the end of the year with November and December the two biggest months - totalling $310b in the US alone - after Trump’s re-election sparked hopes in some quarters of further stock market gains. “Investors’ ‘risk on’ posture was evident throughout the year and was further amplified by the US presidential election in November,” Flood said. “While markets closed the year with a whimper, ETF flows did not,” said Scott Chronert, global head of ETF research at Citi. “December marked the second-best flow month ever for US-listed ETFs. This was an impressive follow-up to the record-setting flow data we saw in November.” The rise of ETFs was not purely a US phenomenon, however, with net inflows in the rest of the world hitting $377b, according to Morningstar’s figures, comfortably above the previous peak of $292b in 2021, with every major domicile reporting record numbers. “South Korea had a blowout year, growing at a torrid 33% rate for the second straight calendar year,” Flood said. Ireland, Europe’s largest ETF hub, grabbed the lion’s share of these non-US flows, however, at some $226b. The ETF industry also accelerated its transition away from its traditional focus on passive, index-tracking funds in 2024. Assets held by actively managed ETFs topped $1t for the first time, rising 61% during the year, even as US-domiciled active mutual funds continued to bleed money. Net flows more than doubled from 2023’s previous record, hitting $339b. Actively managed ETFs now account for 7.8% of industry assets, up from 6.2% 12 months ago. For once, JPMorgan’s wildly popular $37.1b Equity Premium Income Fund (JEPI) was eclipsed in the active space, with iShares’ US Equity Factor Rotation Active ETF (DYNF) heading the leaderboard with $11.7b of net inflows, taking its total assets to $13.7b. Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at SSGA, who only covers US ETF flows, counted record inflows in no less than 19 categories last year, ranging from growth and small cap ETFs to those focused on derivative income and collateralised loan obligations. In another sense the industry is becoming more concentrated, however. At a time when the US share of global stock market capitalisation has risen to its highest level since the early 1970s, just three ETFs focused on the same index - BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) - accounted for $292bn, 19.5% of the global flows, as they took their combined assets to an unprecedented $2.1t. VOO alone took in an “astounding” $117b, Flood said, a record single-year tally for any ETF, as investors chased the index’s 25% annual gain. The other winner from this trend was S&P Global Ratings, which “dominated flows among benchmark index providers”, with the $475b of net new money subsumed by ETFs that track its indices taking its market share to 28%, up five percentage points in five years. Despite this, Invesco outshone BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA in relative terms, with its assets rising 21% during 2024. The Atlanta house largely piggybacked on enthusiasm for the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, with its QQQ Trust (QQQ) and Nasdaq 100 (QQQM) ETFs proving popular, alongside the S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), its own take on the blue-chip index. There were some losers amid the oceans of winners, however. Some niches were out of favour on the fixed income side, including inflation-protected bond funds and emerging market bond ETFs. The latter was tipped into the red by outflows in December “as fears of a more protectionist US fiscal framework led to a stronger dollar and weighed returns”, Bartolini said. In equities, defensive sectors suffered $6.7b of outflows from US-listed ETFs, the second-worst figure ever, he added, led by healthcare, which shipped $7.4b. This pessimism was in complete contrast to the technology sector, where $33b of inflows accounted for 76% of US sector flows in 2024, well above tech’s 37% share of assets, something Bartolini attributed to “broad-based fervour” for artificial intelligence. - The Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Should You Buy This Growth Stock For The Next 5 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive. Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43% Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72% NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive. Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML. Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.

According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company’s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.

We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off.

Title: Why Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Received Analyst Approval This Week?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Received Analyst Approval This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks that received analyst approval this week. The US market performance in the last week was quite bullish, with the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ boasting weekly gains of 3.71%, 3.73%, and 3.84% respectively. The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week. Just like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies. We looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment services provider that offers a wide variety of documentaries, games, TV series, and movies. The company’s target price was downgraded from $1065 to $1040 by Oppenheimer based on valuation concerns. However, the analyst acknowledged that there were hardly any business headwinds and didn’t downgrade the rating. Seaport Global upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, showing they were more bullish on the stock than Oppenheimer. At the end of 2024, the stock underperformed the S&P 500. Moreover, the company’s valuation is not attractive right now. At this point, investors are concerned about the continuous decline in share prices since last month. However, as the analyst ratings show, a lot of the current pessimism is priced in. The impact of the second season of Squid Game show will become apparent during this quarter and that could act as a catalyst for the stock’s next rally. There has been a huge transition in the TV and movie industry in the past 10 years. Being a streaming giant NFLX remained on top among its closest competitors (Amazon Prime Video and Disney) in terms of subscriber count. Having a high CFC ratio (the ability to pay back debt) of 22% shows its sound finances, despite having to spend large amounts of money on creating fresh content. Given all this information, Netflix is still the top choice for customers looking for streaming options. Investors can consider this downturn in price as an opportunity to re-analyze their investment strategy. Overall, NFLX ranks 9th on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.

According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

The company has advanced its efforts in solar energy storage and nuclear by securing two power purchase agreements at new solar facilities, together totaling over 600 MW, with two of the world's leading tech companies – one for 200 MW with Amazon in Texas and one for 405 MW with Microsoft in Illinois. Moreover, the company plans to acquire the entire 15% minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which will make Vistra the sole owner of its highly valuable, carbon-free assets. This acquisition will increase nuclear ownership by 970 MW and solar and energy storage ownership by 200 MW. Overall VST ranks 11th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

Watched a drone flyover on youtube by Jesse G Wald. He was giving an update. We sit on our deck and watch the plumes of smoke going up in the distance every year. Closest we have come to fire here is having helicopters and planes circling over our house as they make their water drops. If a fire does come our way, we are staying to fight. We have done everything we can it protect the house, but it still needs our help if the big event comes. Do you have working fire hydrants? When we built the house we were required to install a 2500 gal water tank hooked up to a fire hydrant we installed near the house. The hydrant had to have fire dept. hose fittings. Over time we have added an additional 3500 gals of storage, an electric pump with 1” hose fittings, a gas powered pump with 1” hose fittings and 200’ of 1” hose. Things do need to be updated and added to though.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): AI at the Core of Technology

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. With everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence “superpower”. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar Starmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade. “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We’re going to make the breakthroughs, we’re going to create the wealth, and we’re going to make AI work for everyone in our country”. Another country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that “the world’s AI runs on American rails” and keep it out of the hands of “malicious actors” who could use it to threaten the United States. Even though the US government may think it’s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don’t necessarily agree. “In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance”. Chipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not “mitigate any threat” but only “weaken America’s global competitiveness” and undermine its innovation. “By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition—the lifeblood of innovation—the Biden Administration’s new rule threatens to squander America’s hard-won technological advantage”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company known for its custom chip offerings and networking assets. On January 15, the company announced the launch of Brocade G710 24-port 64G switch, a new entry switch offering worry-free storage networking and security for small to medium-sized businesses. The Brocade G710 offers low-cost access to Gen 7 Fibre Channel technology.

Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Federal Judge Blasts DEI and BlackRock's 'Incestuous' Relationship in New Ruling

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/18/2025 12:46:32 PM PST by george76 A federal judge in Texas ruled against American Airlines after the company centered employee retirement plans on environmental, social, and governance factors, also known as ESG. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor concluded on Jan. 10 that American Airlines failed to exercise its fiduciary duty to make investment decisions for retirement accounts based on the best interests of the beneficiaries, according to a report from Reuters. O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock, the asset management behemoth which has long been a leading advocate for the ESG investing movement. ... The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” O’Connor wrote in the decision. The decision came after a class action lawsuit from American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of some 100,000 retirement savings participants. ... Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research and an opponent of ESG, celebrated the decision on Jan. 10 via social media, asserting that “any company” which uses BlackRock “could be held liable in the same way” if the ruling holds. BlackRock left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9 following a recent lawsuit from Texas and other Republican-led states. ... The court decision and collapse of the ESG group arguably continue a trend away from diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate America. Walmart, one of the largest private-sector employers in the country, recently reversed many DEI programs after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck, while social media companies owned by Meta also shuttered DEI initiatives.

More reason to require there only be one Federal Court district for the nation, the one in Texas and reduce the other districts to Small Claims courts Praise God for men like Robby Starbuck! ‘O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock” What a bonkers statement. Blackrock is the largest shareholder in AA because it is the largest provider of index funds. If we were to follow his logic no public company could hire a financial firm that runs index funds because total market index funds invest in every public company. It was never diversity and inclusion - it was always a way to get commie losers, sexual weirdos and other trash into high positions to take down companies like Boeing etc. Trojan horse type stuff under the guise of ‘caring about the less fortunate’ Trump got the highest percentage of minority voters from native Americans... They’ve seen white liberal elite hatred ‘in their name’ the longest. There’s plenty of minorities who can get their promotions - without having to compete with Marxists haters put up by white liberal elites. May Blackrock and all of their woke believers bubble and swirl in the sewage treatment plant where idiots get flushed. “May Blackrock and all of their woke believers bubble and swirl in the sewage treatment plant where idiots get flushed.” Very well stated...

We recently published a list of These 10 Firms Took A Hit on Friday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against other firms that took a hit on Friday. Wall Street’s main indices all finished in the green territory on Friday, as investors repositioned their portfolios ahead of president-elect Donald Trump’s return to office. The Dow jumped by 0.78 percent, while the S&P surged by 1 percent. Meanwhile, Nasdaq soared 1.51 percent. However, ten companies under mixed sectors bucked an overall positive market sentiment as multiple negative factors put pressure on investor sentiment. In this article, let’s look at the reasons that dragged their shares performance. To come up with the top 10 losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), a multinational pharmaceutical company, saw its share prices on Friday retreat by 5.27 percent to finish at $78.69 after following news that the company’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss treatment Wegovy are among the 15 drugs targeted for Medicare price negotiations for 2027. A report said Friday that the negotiation process was in line with outgoing president Joe Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, where 15 new drugs are set to undergo a negotiation process for being among the most expensive drugs. It can be learned that drug pricing concerns have already helped drag down the company’s valuation last year, alongside increasing competition for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes medicines. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a Denmark-based firm that owns drug brands such as Levemir, Tresiba, NovoLog, Novolin R, and Novolin N. Overall, NVO ranks 6th on our list of firms that took a hit on Friday. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A real estate broker discussing options with a customer using digital maps and virtual reality. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31 Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) operates as a commercial real estate and investment management company. There are multiple factors that make this company stand out as a worthwhile investment. Firstly, as per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the revenue was $5.9 billion, up 15% in local currency, and resilient revenues grew 16% in local currency, along with transactional revenues up 11% in local currency. In addition, leasing within Markets Advisory increased by 21% with broad-based geographic and asset class growth led by the US office. Secondly, JLL and Slate Asset Management’s joint venture to commercialize Slate's best-in-class technology platform for commercial real estate professionals resulted in JLL Asset Beacon, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology platform that integrates data across asset management functions to create a real-time, end-to-end view of performance. Moreover, the company has launched its artificial intelligence (AI) platform, JLL Falcon, designed to accelerate the digital transformation of the commercial real estate industry. The new platform is a cutting-edge set of AI-enabled software services that combines JLL’s comprehensive proprietary data with generative AI models to deliver timely, revenue-generating and cost-saving insights, as well as maximize returns. Overall JLL ranks 26th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of JLL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Why TikTok isn’t working for US users anymore
URL: https://www.perthnow.com.au/technology/tiktok/trump-may-give-tiktok-a-90-day-reprieve-c-17433402
Time Published: 2025-01-18T19:58:09Z
Full Content:
TikTok has gone dark in the US ahead of a federal ban on the Chinese-owned short-video app, cutting off access to the platform that has captivated nearly half of all Americans, fueled small businesses and shaped online culture. By 10:50pm on Saturday US Eastern Standard Time, the app was not found on Apple and Google’s app stores, which are prohibited from offering the platform under a law that required TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a US ban. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US,” a message on the app said. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,” the message said. Earlier US President-elect Donald Trump said he would “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office, as the app with 170 million American users buzzed with nervous anticipation ahead of the shutdown. “The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate,” Trump told NBC. “If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday.” Users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would “force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We’re working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible”. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden’s administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. “We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. “China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said. In the lead up, TikTok and its aficionados geared up for goodbye. Some on the app filmed themselves frantically scrolling or sharing final secrets with their followers ahead of the ban. Leaders at Oracle, the main cloud computing provider for TikTok’s US operations, told staff to prepare to shut down servers that host US TikTok data as soon as 9pm ET on Saturday (1pm AEDT on Sunday) in advance of ban from Sunday, The Information reported. Without a decision by Biden to formally invoke a 90-day delay in the deadline, companies providing services to TikTok or hosting the app could face enormous financial liability. Experts said Trump could also direct his Justice Department to “deprioritise” or not enforce the law but it is not clear if that will provide enough legal protection to app store owners Apple and Google providing crucial services for TikTok. Trump tried to ban and force the divestment of TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by US courts. Uncertainty over the app’s future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their shares rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a “hair on fire” moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialise to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a “political resolution” of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company’s plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each. with AP

Title: Letters: Sláintecare embeds two-tier system it aimed to eradicate

Nearly half the population still has private health cover. Photo: Stock image/Getty Healthcare Sir — All parties are signed up to implement the Sláintecare plan of 2017. One of its key principles is equitable access to healthcare. OECD research has shown Ireland has one of the most inequitable hospital care systems, and voluntary private health insurance was found to be the largest contributor to that inequity, a fact not referred to in Sláintecare. Róisín Shortall, chair of the Oireachtas committee that developed the plan, said in a radio interview in 2017 that there would be such a good public hospital service after implementation of the plan that only 20pc of the population would need to buy private health insurance. After nearly eight years of the 10-year plan, 47pc of the population continue to have private health insurance. Through the acceptance of funding of private hospital care by private insurance in the Sláintecare plan, all political parties have ensured there will be quicker access to private hospital care and insurers clinics, such as VHI’s 360 Health Centres or Laya’s Health and Wellbeing Clinics, than that afforded to non-insured patients to public hospital care. The two-tier system between private and public hospitals will flourish, as manifested, for example, in the recently announced €500m investment by the Larry Goodman Trust at the Blackrock Health Hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Limerick. I have just retired after 33 years as a hospital consultant and a period in political activism campaigning for a health system that treated patients as patients and not as private or public. I deplore the fact that our political system and its Sláintecare plan will ensure this wealthy country will have embedded in its system in 2025, and for the foreseeable future, inequitable access to hospital care funded by private health insurance. Dr John Barton, Ballymoneen Road, Galway Sir — Colin Murphy’s exploration of the contradictions of Elon Musk was apposite (‘We need to talk about Elon’, January 12). Musk’s vision of free speech is less a democratic ideal than a digital oligarchy, where the loudest voice belongs to the wealthiest player. In this skewed marketplace of ideas, engagement becomes currency, outrage reigns supreme and truth is reduced to collateral damage. What Musk offers is not free speech, but expensive influence, reshaping public discourse in his own image — a cautionary tale of how technology, when wielded by the powerful, can amplify echo chambers rather than challenge them. Governments and democratic institutions must act to safeguard public discourse. Social media platforms should be regulated for transparency and fairness, with algorithms prevented from artificially amplifying individual voices. Limiting monopolistic control and supporting independent journalism are essential to combat misinformation. Global standards for online free speech, coupled with independent oversight, can ensure accountability, while fostering decentralised platforms provides alternatives to profit-driven networks. Together, these measures can help protect democracy from the distortion of digital power and influence. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Sir — The outgoing government promised to enact the Occupied Territories Bill. It seems as though the incoming coalition may decide similarly. The bare-faced theft of Pales­tinian land continues and the Israeli government and its people continue to ignore the International Court of Justice and world opinion. While I would love to see Ireland and other western countries cutting off all commercial and academic ties with all of Israel, certain actions just aren’t practicable I would like the same for relations with Russia and a few others, but we live in an interconnected world and sometimes you deal with people because you have to, not because you want to. Israel may be small in physical extent, but it is powerful militarily and politically. I can easily envisage a situation in which corporate America decides to discourage foreign direct investment in Ireland and in which American companies decide to leave Ireland, all for the sake of supporting Israel. Those advocates urging that bill now becomes law should ask themselves if they are willing to lose their jobs for the sake of this fine move, where no other country will follow us. Anthony Hanrahan, Salruck, Renvyle, Co Galway Sir – When Bray Bridge Club held one of its main events last week, the winning men’s pair on the night were George Daly and John Hautz. There is great karma in John’s story. The club moved into a beautiful new premises on the same night. It was built as a school in the 1880s. John Hautz recalls it was the first school he attended in — wait for it — 1940. So, 85 years later, John wins in his alma mater. By the way, and contrary to many people’s perception, you don’t need to be of senior years to play bridge. Some of our best are under 30, but it is a game for life. Anyone interested in learning should check out the website cbai.ie. Brendan Martin, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir — Emigration to Australia and other English-speaking countries by Irish teachers means the immigrant countries are getting for free teachers trained by Ireland — and they can afford to pay them more. Meanwhile, Irish school authorities are generally hostile to foreign-trained teachers. I have been comparing teacher salaries in Melbourne, where primary teachers are paid from €48,000 to €75,000 in steps over 10 years. Here we have a ridiculous 27-step pay scale (for doing the same job) not found elsewhere. A pensioned teacher earns nearly as much as a novice. It used be there were 32 students for each Irish teacher; it is now 16.5. The average class size here is 23. That’s the same as in Australia but Japan copes with 38 pupils per class. (It was 73 in my first class in Coláiste Mhuire.) I’ve ignored the fact that we have teaching assistants now. We have done away with the primary school examination, so we can no longer measure performance. And it seems we can’t afford the level of kindergarten schooling required. Only social media gives us an indication, and it is awful. To deal with the current problem of teachers emigrating to seek better pay and the prospect of buying their own home, I would like to offer these three suggestions. 1. Start new teachers on the seventh increment of the current pay in selected areas to match Australia. 2. Build or buy homes near schools and make them available to teachers while they are employed there. This would kill commuting and create some interest and competence in teachers in their local history and heritage, now missing. 3. Bring back a performance test for primary school-leavers. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Sir — What is the voting public to make of the shenanigans taking place with the formation of the new government? Do they have no shame? Apparently, government ministers are overworked, so there is a requirement for three extra junior ministers. Pull the other one. The pigs are at the trough. Then we have the jobless Independents setting up a technical group so they can be part of the opposition — even though they have sold their souls by pledging to support the new government. How does that work? It is a mockery. I say they have sold their souls because they will have to support unpopular policies, like the carbon tax and not putting in place a no-fault eviction ban. Do they think they can speak against a policy as part of the opposition and then vote for the legislation in the Dáil? It also means that even though they support the government, they will take opposition speaking time, leaders’ questions and chairs of Oireachtas Committees. In short, it will undermine opposition to the government. It makes a travesty of democracy. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Sir — The Regional Independent Group agreed a Programme for Government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and now wishes to sit on the opposition benches at the same time. It’s quite clear that some of said group have never contemplated actually being in govern­ment and have allowed the prospect go completely to their heads. Perhaps someone should explain that it’s like playing a Gaelic football match and during the game some players are permitted to run to the sideline and shout down their own teammates. I fear a five-year episode of Father Ted approaches. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan ​ Sir — As Groucho Marx once said: “These are my principles, and if you don’t like them, well, I have others.” This can now become the official motto of our new government and its Independent members. Amazing how so many alleged red lines become irrelevant when power comes beckoning. And we wonder why only half our citizens vote? Tony O’Gorman, Limerick ​ Sir — If I had run for election for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, I would be asking myself why I hadn’t stood as an Independent, considering a group of nine Independents has bizarrely secured five ministerial jobs, while another has already secured the Ceann Comhairle post. The acro­nym Gubu comes to mind. John McGeady, Blackrock, Co Louth Sir — Independent TD Danny Healy-Rae has pledged to supp­ort the new government. His brother Michael is to become a junior minister. I wonder how they’ll cap that? Eithne MacFadden, Carrigart, Co Donegal ​ Sir — The general election is now history and the next government is ready to go. There are no by-elections on the political horizon, though they have been known to emerge quickly. The election of 2025 is going to be the race for Áras an Uachtaráin. Wayne O’Connor assessed a number of contenders (January 12), but there does not appear to be any contender standing out as a clear favourite yet. In 1990, Dick Spring pulled a rabbit out of the hat when he convinced Mary Robinson to run for Labour after they had had a poor general election showing. A precedent was set, and there could be a lesson in this for all the political leaders. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo ​ Sir — Your editorial that Paschal Donohoe should be given the housing portfolio in the new government would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious (‘Give Paschal Donohoe a shot at solving the housing crisis’, January 12). The bibliophile minister presided over the biggest giveaway budget in the history of the State last October (against the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council), which is fuelling inflation again, not least house prices, which are predicted to increase by 7pc to 10pc again this year, according to estate agents. That’s an additional €35,000 that savers will need to find to purchase just an ordinary home where the median house price in the country now stands at €350,000. With a shortage of plumbers, electricians and carpenters now beginning to emerge from the construction industry, one wonders in what book of traditional economic theory will the Public Expenditure Minister, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform find the answers that your editorial so wishes. The good people of Kerry decided not to elect a Fine Gael TD in the general election. They saw through the spin. When will the rest of the country come to realise that it is the current Government’s neo-liberal housing policies that are making the situation worse, not better? Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry ​ Sir — On January 24, we celebrate the International Day of Education, recognising its vital role in promoting peace and development. As a Muslim woman living in Ireland and a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, I want to highlight that Islam strongly supports education for both men and women. In Islam, education is not just encouraged, it is a fundamental duty. The Ahmadiyya Muslim community embodies these teachings by promoting education worldwide. As we celebrate this day, let’s remember that education is a powerful tool for equality and empowerment. By embracing these values in Ireland and beyond, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Nudrat Jahan Malik, Bettystown, Co Meath Sir — How many more excellent articles, like Eilis O’Hanlon’s last Sunday, and appeals from those concerned about the welfare of mothers and children are required before a proper robust debate takes place, resulting in the provision of choice for mothers and babies? It’s a long time since the late, great Nora Bennis campaigned for mothers in the home and was rebuffed by so-called women’s organisations. How hypocritical it is that we are constantly hearing of the importance of choice, but on this issue, seemingly, it is only heeded when it aligns with the views of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, generously supported by the government. The issue demonstrates the total lack of support for families and family life, leading to so many social problems and, ultimately, to homelessness. Any hope of an awakening to the problems mounting up and the promotion of a stable and content society? Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town ​ Sir — While she may live in a very different world to the vast majority, Kate Middleton has been remarkably plain-spoken about having cancer and all the trauma this entails. It is heartening that she is now in remission. I was also pleased to hear her good news thus expressed without any reference to getting “the all-clear”, which from experience is, I feel, an expression that frequently bestows a false level of expectation on the cancer patient, their family and friends. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny ​ Sir — Sam McBride wrote last week that unionists might one day consider Irish unification, but never our flag, the Tricolour. I suggest a compromise — a new flag consisting of the Tricolour with the red hand of Ulster taking its place in the white band. Perhaps this would be acceptable to both sides. What do your readers think? Bernard Naughton, Farranree, Co Cork ​ Sir — Your columnist Declan Lynch claims no sensible person can love “remorseless” Manchester City. Well, I have been a City supporter for over 50 years and I am a very sensible person. Sour grapes could be the problem — Declan supports Liverpool.

Title: Trump says he may give TikTok a 90-day reprieve on Monday

World Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. WASHINGTON: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday (Jan 18) and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the platform used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 0345 GMT (11.45am Singapore time): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would "force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We're working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible". It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. After the court defeat, TikTok CEO Shou Chew appealed to Trump, thanking him for his "commitment to work with us to find a solution". Trump "truly understands our platform", he added. Chew is also set to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday. The law requires Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, blocking new downloads. The companies could face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user who can access the app. Oracle, which hosts TikTok's servers, would also be legally obligated to enforce the ban. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. A last-minute proposal made Saturday by the highly-valued start-up Perplexity AI offered a merger with the US subsidiary of TikTok, a source with knowledge of the deal told AFP. That deal could allow parent company ByteDance a possible solution without selling off the app entirely. The plan, first reported by US broadcaster CNBC, would create a new joint venture combining the assets of US TikTok and Perplexity AI, which has been backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The proposal did not include a price for the transaction, but the source estimated it would be at least US$50 billion. Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner, has also made an offer to purchase TikTok's US activity and said he's "ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal". Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary, who is involved in that offer, told Fox News that ByteDance was offered US$20 billion for TikTok's US operation. He acknowledged the legal uncertainty over the case, with it remaining an open question whether an executive order by Trump to halt the ban would override the law. "Congress wrote this law to be virtually president-proof," warned Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of industry trade group Chamber of Progress. Sarah Kreps, a professor of government and law at Cornell University, said that "if an executive order conflicts with an existing law, the law takes precedence, and the order can be struck down by the courts". With TikTok forced into a shutdown, its US-based rivals Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could reap benefits. Thousands of worried TikTok users have protectively turned to Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), a Chinese social media network similar to Instagram. Nicknamed "Red Note" by its American users, it was the most downloaded app on the US Apple Store this week.

Title: Long-term benefits predicted from restoration of domestic energy production

By James Varney. Real Clear Wire January 18, 2025 The energy policy of the incoming Trump administration seems as concise as it is clear: Slash domestic energy costs under the mantra, popularized in 2008 by GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, of “Drill, baby, drill!” While a RealClearInvestigations canvass of energy experts suggests many of them foresee long-term benefits in that approach, it’s less clear to them that consumers will see immediate change. In other words, Trump may not deliver in 2025 on his campaign pledge to “cut energy prices in half within 12 months.” On the other hand, given expected huge increases in energy demand, a more aggressive approach to exploiting domestic resources should help keep prices steady and buttress affordability in the long run. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is a soundbite, really, that stands for increasing domestic energy production from reliable sources, meaning located in the United States and not subject to geopolitical shocks and other disruptions,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of climate and environmental policy at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank long supportive of the oil and gas industries. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! One thing everyone agrees on is that the Trump administration is likely to continue the whipsaw of 21st-century energy policies of the United States. From Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden, and now back to Trump, the U.S. has zigzagged between the conviction that global warming threatens the planet, requiring a wrenching and expensive shift from fossil fuels, and the belief that society is better off when energy is abundant and affordable. Despite his campaign warnings of insufficient energy supplies, Trump will take office with high domestic oil and gas production. Since the new year, the price of oil has hovered around $75 a barrel, roughly equivalent to what it was a year ago and down from the more than $130 a barrel price it hit at the midpoint of President Biden’s term. It’s true that Biden’s policies limited energy exploration on federal lands and banned some liquid national gas exports, but American energy companies have refined their techniques, allowing them to tap more from existing sources. Consequently, the Trump administration will be trying to goose production at a time when environmentalists insist it is unnecessary, and with inflation still percolating it may be difficult to deliver lower prices in the near term. Trump conceded last month that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up, you know, it’s very hard,” but added: “I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down.” “I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation and supply,” Trump stated on the campaign trail. “Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.” All of that is doable, experts said, but energy markets are nothing if not unpredictable. Even as the U.S. enjoys a relatively ample supply of energy, new warnings have emerged about the ravenous energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers that are at the forefront of technological innovation. Moves that put the U.S. on more solid production footing are expected to benefit consumers by stabilizing prices while also leaving the nation more secure in its energy future, according to supporters of Trump’s outlook. “There are levers he can pull that will remove the disincentives to drill,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics (NCEA). “At current prices it might not be that attractive to drill, and of course Trump wants to bring down prices so there’s a natural tension between those objectives.” Still, optimism is high among energy mavens sympathetic to Trump’s approach. As analyst Alex Epstein told commentator Jordan Peterson in a conversation made public Tuesday, “I’ve been at this 17 years now, and it’s definitely at a peak in terms of enthusiasm and opportunity in this sphere.” Biden’s departure will leave an energy sphere shifted toward renewables by design rather than free market forces. While Trump’s victory last November would seem to indicate a majority of Americans agree with his design, the Biden administration is going down swinging on its position that global warming is an existential threat, and ramping up efforts to limit oil and gas production in the U.S. Through an executive order on Jan. 6, the administration banned exploration in 625 million acres of saltwater, covering the east and west coasts, much of the Gulf of Mexico, and some stretches on the Alaskan coast. Left-wing environmental groups that cheered the sweeping move insist Trump will be unable to reverse it. Such parting shots are of a piece with Biden’s entire term, which began with a raft of executive orders designed to shut down oil and gas projects under Trump, and consistent maneuvers to limit lease sales and permits, starve the fossil-fuel industry financially, and pump hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into various green energy schemes. Biden’s anti-oil-and-gas strategy, coupled with his gigantic spending initiatives, triggered the worst U.S. inflation in decades. Biden also deep-sixed the previously approved Keystone XL pipeline to pump oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast; offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has stagnated, and new liquid natural gas projects were paused. In 2024, the government held no offshore lease sales for the first time in 42 years, and in their final weeks Biden’s team offered the legal minimum of Alaskan sites for auction. “The Biden administration was at war with our industry,” said Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “Industries with expensive long-term projects like offshore exploration and LNG [Liquified Natural Gas] are looking for certainty in the marketplace.” Environmentalists made much of what they called tepid interest in the recent Alaska lease auctions. But industry executives said the low interest was more attributable to the limited nature of the auctions and the fact Biden officials chose the least attractive sites from a geological perspective. In addition, while it is true domestic production is at a record high, the total is only a fraction greater than it was in 2019 before the COVID lockdowns. Just as Biden canceled or paused oil and gas initiatives when he took office, Trump can restart them on Jan. 20 in keeping with the nation’s 21st-century energy policy zigzag. In addition, Trump is expected to again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, and the U.S. is unlikely to remain an eager participant in the various conferences the global warming alarmists hold in farflung cities. While climate change activists have raised alarms about such moves, supporters of more gas and oil exploration note that over the past 15 years, no country has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than the U.S., in large part because of the transition to natural gas from coal. “The Trump administration should easily be able to just start approving LNG permits again,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. “The greens will likely sue based on the bogus study the Department of Energy released, but it won’t hold up to scrutiny.” In addition to disengaging from United Nations-led climate agreements, Trump could take three other moves that would indicate Washington will end its hostile stance toward fossil fuels, Burnett told RCI. Two of those would involve holding regular lease sales as required by law, and laying down specific timeframes for the conclusion of the permitting process. Third, and most significant, would be rescinding of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Obama-era “endangerment finding,” regarding greenhouse gases, according to Burnett and others. Should the EPA drop that measure, which put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of renewable energy by labeling CO2 harmful, the oil and gas industry would prosper. There is other low-hanging fruit likely to be plucked via a “drill, baby, drill” mindset, which experts said would help signal the U.S. is committed to abundant energy now and in the future. The office of “climate czar” which was created by Biden and which has adamantly refused to break down how it spends its money could be shuttered, along with the “environmental justice” offices Biden implanted in various government agencies. While some projects like the Keystone XL pipeline appear to be dead, holding more lease sales, ungumming the permit process, and removing regulatory obstacles would all send clear signals the U.S. would be open for business for oil and gas production. In addition, federal lawyers could end litigation or decline to defend against lawsuits that might be filed against regulations pushed through during Biden’s term, according to energy experts. Trump could also replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawn down by Biden since 2022. Chris Wright, the executive Trump has nominated as energy secretary, is a former oil executive who participated in the fracking boom, but he has long championed policies that would increase all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear. Similarly, his interior secretary nominee, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, is expected to slash regulations and open up more opportunities for exploration and mining on federal lands. What the Trump administration does do with energy will not be confined to oil. This month Trump announced a $20 billion foreign investment in building data centers here in the U.S., a part of the technology explosion linked to artificial intelligence and a development that will require enormous amounts of energy. The juice for such projects comes from natural gas, not oil, and green lights on LNG pipelines and facilities from the Trump administration would facilitate them. A recent report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization that seeks to “reduce energy waste and combat climate change,” predicts that new data centers, manufacturing facilities, and electric vehicles will require a vast expansion of the electric grid during the next decade. “A data center can be built in 12-18 months and it needs power 24/7 so windmills aren’t going to do it,” Mills said. Yet another component of “drill, baby, drill” would be geared toward ensuring futures markets and U.S. independence, according to Mills and others. After curbing domestic oil and gas, Biden was put in the uncomfortable position of rattling the U.S. energy cup before Saudi Arabia, a regime he had been sharply critical of, and nations generally hostile to the U.S. such as Venezuela. Such foreign policy contortions would be avoided by ramping up domestic production, and it might also insulate the U.S. from “black swan” events that can send shockwaves through global energy markets. It’s unclear, for example, what will happen with supplies from Iran if Trump, as expected, ratchets up sanctions on the Tehran theocracy that Biden relaxed, or if Israel were to extend its bombing campaign against Iran and target the mullahs’ export facilities. The situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia present another factor. Of the four major pipelines Russia used to supply Europe with most of its energy, only one, that running farthest south that comes up through Bulgaria and Romania, is still active. Thus, increased domestic production and supply would cushion the U.S. from possible adverse impacts on global markets and also provide more profit and jobs via exports. “Policies of restriction are bad for consumers and our national security,” Pyle said. “The street is fickle, they saw money in ‘green’ but they’ll go wherever the money is.” Trump’s pro-industry outlook is also aligned with recent market tradewinds, which have shifted away from the “environmental, social and governance” investing that leftist groups and Wall Street firms like BlackRock had pushed. Since the end of 2023, some $14 trillion was withdrawn from such funds, and in the new year many big banks and investment companies, such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have announced their departure from the “ESG” fold. Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis have also fought against left-wing investing by pulling huge state pension funds from managers that embrace those trends. “People are obviously concerned about the price at the pump and the cost of electricity, but it’s important that the government gives the industry a clear signal that the policy environment will be reframed to ultimately benefit American consumers,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute. “I think there’s a lot more interest in energy exploration than there was four years ago. The new administration should mark a return to the long-established, bipartisan consensus that energy production is good for the U.S.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: How a 'low performer' label makes things worse for laid-off workers

Targeting "low performers" might seem like a logical tactic for big companies looking to streamline their workforces. But when Meta and Microsoft recently announced performance-based cuts, it sparked a debate online about the potential impacts of publicly labeling someone a "low performer" — a term loaded with negative connotations. Layoffs can already be traumatic for workers, and experts say such tags only compound the issue, creating new obstacles for those back on the job hunt. "Here's the real deal — a 'low performer' at Meta could be a rockstar anywhere else," Jan Tegze, a Czech Republic-based tech recruiter, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. But now, these "people have to job hunt with this label hanging over them. Every recruiter, every hiring manager will see these headlines." Jennifer Dulski, the founder and CEO of Rising Team and a management lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, said on LinkedIn that it was "reasonable to let people go for lower performance than others on the team, and to share that reasoning with them." "However, publicly branding employees as low performers serves no one — not the individuals, not the remaining team, and not the company's reputation," she added. "That will stick with and damage many people's careers. It's unnecessary and punitive," Jonathan Shottan, chief product and content officer at Tonal, said. Previous research has suggested that finding a job may be more difficult for laid-off workers due to the stigma they may encounter among potential employers. And with job seekers also facing a slowing job market and new hurdles such as the ever-expanding rollout of AI in workplaces, the added "low performer" tag may make the job search even trickier. Others have defended Meta and Microsoft's announcements, however. "Who would you fire? Your top performers?" One LinkedIn user wrote in response to Tegze's post. "There isn't a company in the world who would let go of anyone that they didn't think was their lowest performers." "What if.... they 'are' actually low performers," another said. "Stop jumping on the let's bash Zuk bandwagon." In an internal memo seen by Business Insider earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and act quickly to "move out low-performers." The cuts will affect 5% of the company's workforce, equivalent to about 3,600 roles. Microsoft has not announced the number of employees it plans to let go. For those who do find themselves caught in the layoffs, experts have some tips to help ensure they give themselves the best chance of getting back to work. Writing on X, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president, advised those hit by cuts targeting low performers to carefully and openly explain their situation to hiring managers. Evans said it can be natural for recruiters to wonder if an interviewee has performance problems that they should avoid and that "your ability to respond calmly and confidently will matter just as much as the actual content of your answer." "If your entire team or division was cut, this is the strongest story. Be clear about that and say, 'My entire team was cut.' Point them to a news story that verifies your claim if you can," he said. He added: "Never badmouth your old boss or company." "Just like dating, no one wants to start a relationship with someone who isn't over their ex." Business Insider contacted Meta and Microsoft for comment. Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Louis Navellier's Top 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Universal Corporation (NYSE:UVV) stands against the other stocks. Louis Navellier is a prominent American investor, author, and financial analyst, best known for his quantitative approach to stock selection and his long-standing track record in the investment industry. As the founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, a private investment management firm, he has built a reputation for identifying high-growth stocks with significant upside potential. Navellier’s approach blends rigorous quantitative analysis with a focus on fundamental factors, positioning him as a leading voice in growth investing. Born in 1957, Navellier developed an early interest in the stock market. He honed his analytical skills while studying at California State University, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Finance. It was during his college years that Navellier discovered his passion for quantitative analysis, developing a stock-picking system as part of a class project. This project laid the foundation for his career, as he created a system to identify market-beating stocks using specific growth and valuation criteria. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In 1980, Navellier founded Navellier & Associates, which has grown into a respected investment management firm catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Over the years, the firm has managed billions of dollars in assets, applying Navellier’s quantitative methodology to identify outperforming stocks. Navellier is also widely known for publishing the Navellier Growth newsletter, where he shares stock recommendations and insights into market trends. In his newsletter-based recommendations, many stocks have achieved annualized returns exceeding 20% during high-growth market periods. Navellier’s approach focuses on finding stocks that exhibit strong growth characteristics while maintaining sound fundamentals. He relies heavily on quantitative analysis, utilizing algorithms and statistical models to screen for stocks with high revenue and earnings growth, solid profit margins, and favorable valuation metrics. Unlike many value investors who prioritize underpriced securities, Navellier embraces growth investing, emphasizing companies with strong momentum and the potential for rapid expansion. This strategy often leads him to sectors like technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Navellier & Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Navellier & Associates’ Stake: $3.7 million Universal Corporation (NYSE:UVV) is a company that deals in sourcing, processing, and supplying leaf tobacco and plant-based ingredients worldwide. The firm is one of the top long-term stock picks of Louis Navellier. It has been a part of the 13F portfolio of the fund since the second quarter of 2020. Back then, the stake consisted of around 82,000 shares purchased at an average price of $43.98. In six of the last seven quarters, the hedge has reduced its stake in the firm, although the trimming has not been too noteworthy. Overall UVV ranks 14th on our list of Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of UVV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness. The founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%. In his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis. Asness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following: “I’m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That’s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.” Following a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto. Despite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash. Our Methodology To make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. AQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $558.8 million One of the largest names in technology, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a strong presence in both the hardware and software sectors. The company's core strength lies in providing networking and custom chips for a number of different applications. Back on December 23, 2024, UBS increased its price target for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270, up from $220, while maintaining a Buy rating. The updated artificial intelligence revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 reflect roughly 20% and 40% in expected growth, respectively. This outlook was determined on the assumptions of a conservative market share, as well as anticipations around the expansion of the company's serviceable addressable market (SAM), as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets ready to add two more hyperscaler clients for its AI offerings. For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.1 billion in revenue alongside an EPS of $1.42. The company's semiconductor division did incredibly well, generating about $8.2 billion in revenue driven by sustained AI demand. In comparison, the software segment didn't fare quite as well, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Even so, the tech giant expects $14.6 billion in revenue, a 66% EBITDA margin, as well as an implied EPS of $1.51 for Q1 2025. On top of that, Broadcom counts on a sizable increase in XPU ASIC production during the second half of the year, powered by new 3nm products expected to deliver unit growth and higher average selling prices. Overall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Four of Canada's biggest banks leave climate alliance

Time Published: 2025-01-18T15:08:02Z

Toronto By Ian Bickis, The Canadian Press Posted January 18, 2025 9:03 am. Last Updated January 18, 2025 10:04 am. TORONTO — Four of Canada’s biggest banks have left the UN-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance that aims to accelerate climate action among financial institutions. Banks including BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group and CIBC confirmed Friday they were no longer members. The withdrawals from the alliance follow on departures by the six largest banks in the U.S. in recent weeks ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Financial institutions are pulling back following sustained criticism from U.S. Republicans on various climate alliances and the very concept of factoring environmental risks into their business operations. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, left the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative earlier this month in a move that led the group to suspend activities and launch a review of the initiative, citing “recent developments in the U.S.” Canadian banks did not cite issues in the U.S. for why they were leaving the alliance, but in statements said they are able to continue with their climate work without the help of the group. BMO spokesman Jeff Roman said the bank is fully committed to its climate strategy and supporting its clients in the transition to net zero. “We have robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements,” he said. National Bank said it left the alliance as it streamlines how it reports on its plans and progress. It said it would have a pragmatic approach and work with companies in all sectors to decarbonize. TD said it has what it needs to advance its strategy and advise its clients as they adapt their businesses. CIBC said the alliance was formed when the global industry was scaling up climate efforts but that the space has evolved enough for it to go it alone. “Having made significant progress alongside our clients in these areas, we are now well-positioned to further this work outside of the formal structure of the NZBA,” said spokesman Tom Wallis. The withdrawal of banks from the alliance shows the need for government to step in, said Greenpeace senior energy strategist Keith Stewart. “To call this a craven act of cowardice on climate would be too kind,” Stewart said in a statement. “It does, however, demonstrate that if we want to avoid more communities being burned or flooded in climate-fuelled disasters by moving big money out of fossil fuels and into climate solutions, then we need governments to regulate banks the same way they do smokestacks and tailpipes.” At a Jan. 7 conference RBC chief executive Dave McKay said the alliance was in flux and questioned whether it was the right mechanism to reduce emissions. The bank was still listed as a member as of early Saturday, as was Scotiabank and credit unions Vancity and Coast Capital. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 18, 2025.

Title: JPMorgan and BlackRock C-suite departure surprises show why succession in finance is extra tricky, experts say

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. CEO candidate departures at BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase show that finding an exceptional replacement is tough, and keeping good candidates committed is a challenge in itself. The departure announcements of possible CEO successors at both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are the latest reminders that CEO transitions are anything but simple, experts say, especially when it comes to the world’s top finance jobs. Mark Wiedman, BlackRock’s top client-facing executive and a possible successor to CEO Larry Fink, said Wednesday he would voluntarily step away from his role in the spring after a 20-year stint at the firm. On the same day, two JPMorgan executives apparently took their names out of the running to replace the longest serving CEO of a major bank, Jamie Dimon (One is retiring and the other reportedly has no interest in the role.) Both examples prove the difficulty of replacing a longtime leader, and in finance, the transition process is particularly difficult, said Chris Stanley, Moody’s senior director and its banking industry practice lead. A potential CEO candidate needs to have a good grasp of the complexities of the business in any industry. But in finance they also need to be familiar with the increasing regulations imposed on the industry over the last 30 years, said Stanley. And in modern finance, so much specialization is required in operations, finance, sales, and risk, that it’s hard to find a candidate with a strong understanding of each area. “As the bank gets larger, the kind of specialization, or the expertise that's required in those four broad areas, but then individually, in each of the business units of the bank just becomes a really hard thing to to contain in one person,” Stanley told Fortune. On top of the hard skills required for the job, he added that big bank and finance CEOs need to have the charisma to sell a shared vision of the firm’s direction to employees, shareholders, and the board. “In a commodity business like banking, where the margins are so thin, it's a pretty compelling story you have to tell to say, ‘We're going to change what we're doing. We're going to invest over here. This is where we see opportunity,’” he said. To add yet another complicating factor to the mix, top executives are likely on someone’s radar elsewhere. When an employee is identified as a candidate for the CEO job, whether by their company or the media, they may reconsider when other opportunities come knocking, said Larry Hartmann, CEO of global talent advisory firm ZRG Partners. This is especially true if the candidate isn’t confident that they’ll beat out the other contenders. Hartmann, whose firm has helped Subway and the NCAA find their top leaders, said even getting on the shortlist for the top job raises your profile for top recruiters like him. “They’re going to be someone that another organization would value,” Hartmann told Fortune. “They’re kind of referenced in a strong way already by being mentioned in that light.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Federal Judge Blasts DEI and BlackRock's 'Incestuous' Relationship in New Ruling

Time Published: 2025-01-18T14:19:35Z
Full Content:
A federal judge in Texas ruled against American Airlines after the company centered employee retirement plans on environmental, social, and governance factors, also known as ESG. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor concluded on Jan. 10 that American Airlines failed to exercise its fiduciary duty to make investment decisions for retirement accounts based on the best interests of the beneficiaries, according to a report from Reuters. O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock, the asset management behemoth which has long been a leading advocate for the ESG investing movement. “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” O’Connor wrote in the decision. The decision came after a class action lawsuit from American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of some 100,000 retirement savings participants. O’Connor will decide at a later date whether the beneficiaries suffered harm and whether the airline must pay damages. A spokesperson for BlackRock denied in a statement to Reuters that the company’s emphasis on ESG diminishes the creation of investment value. “We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients,” the spokesperson asserted. “Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.” Reuters noted that the ruling may have been the first of its kind since conservatives increased their criticisms of the ESG movement in recent years as pushing left-wing social objectives while distracting from the maximization of returns for investors. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research and an opponent of ESG, celebrated the decision on Jan. 10 via social media, asserting that “any company” which uses BlackRock “could be held liable in the same way” if the ruling holds. BlackRock left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9 following a recent lawsuit from Texas and other Republican-led states. The entity, which committed major players in the asset management industry to “a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximise long-term value of assets,” entirely ceased operations after the departure of BlackRock, per a Monday report from the New York Post. The court decision and collapse of the ESG group arguably continue a trend away from diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate America. Walmart, one of the largest private-sector employers in the country, recently reversed many DEI programs after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck, while social media companies owned by Meta also shuttered DEI initiatives.

Title: TikTok faces US ban deadline as users brace for fallout

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the platform used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," the message notified users trying to use the app late on Saturday night. Even if temporary, the unprecedented shutdown of TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, is set to have a wide-ranging impact on U.S.-China relations, U.S. domestic politics, the social media marketplace and millions of Americans who depend on the app economically and culturally. The United States has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users, and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provided assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. MOVE TO ALTERNATIVES Under the law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform had until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. Biden's White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the White House statement. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Snap have seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. "This is my new home now," wrote a user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words "tiktokrefugee" and "sad". Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. "I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days," wrote @RavenclawJedi. 'HAIR ON FIRE' MOMENT NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was "experiencing temporary technical difficulties." Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.

Title: Irish rugby needs Munster remaining competitive at the elite end of European rugby
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/01/18/irish-rugby-needs-munster-remaining-competitive-at-the-elite-end-of-european-rugby/
Time Published: 2025-01-18T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Munster are clinging on to second place in Pool 3 of the Champions Cup by the slenderest of margins ahead of Saracens, namely a points difference of +29 as against +28, with both teams on 10 match points. Clinging on somehow seems apt, much like their status as one of European rugby’s grandees. Realistically, therefore, Munster probably have to beat Northampton in Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday afternoon (kick-off 3.15pm) to ensure they finish above the Saints and thus ensure themselves of a home tie in the Round of 16 for the first time in three seasons. Otherwise the expectation must be that Saracens will better Munster’s result when they host Castres 24 hours later. Failure to progress beyond the Round of 16 would mean Munster going three successive campaigns without reaching the quarter-finals for the first time since the inaugural three seasons of the competition from 1995-96 to 1997-98, ie, back when the Irish provinces didn’t really count. Even as things stand Munster have only reached one quarter-final in the last five seasons, when losing to Toulouse in a goal-kicking competition after an epic stalemate over 100 minutes. Although it tells us much about the Munster’s hierarchy’s priorities that this match had to be played in the Aviva Stadium as, despite the quarter-final weekend being known in advance, they had leased out Thomond Park for Ed Sheeran concerts. There has been one Round of 16 tie behind closed doors and a first leg of a two-legged last 16 tie, but the last time Munster hosted a quarter-final at Thomond Park was in 2018, when Andrew Conway’s try manufactured a trademark Houdini-esque act of escapism against Toulon. For sure Munster have had some wonderful players in that time, and they are a well-coached squad. They couldn’t have won the URC title two seasons ago, or finished top of the regular 18-game campaign last season, without still being a good side. But a third successive season without a third Champions Cup tie at Thomond Park, and that invaluable source of revenue, would be revisiting those mid-90s years. And a seventh successive season without a quarter-final at Thomond Park would be a famine. Compare and contrast with the ensuing 20 seasons from 1998-99 to 2017-18, when Munster reached 17 quarter-finals, of which nine were in Limerick, and one in Lansdowne Road while Thomond Park was being redeveloped. The late, great Garrett Fitzgerald was CEO of Munster for those two decades, and maintained Munster’s achievements were a miracle given Leinster’s socio-economic advantages. Even so they seem to have become a comparatively mismanaged machine since those halcyon days, and they are producing increasingly less players for international rugby. True, the class of the Noughties was a golden generation. But this week’s two Irish squad announcements for the Six Nations and the Under-20 Six Nations are instructive. Simon Easterby’s 36-man squad contains only five Munster players, the same as Connacht, one more than Ulster, and 18 less than Leinster. Munster fans can argue all they want about individual cases such as Tom Ahern, Gavin Coombes and Alex Kendellen, while Oli Jager and Craig Casey are injured, and under David Nucifora the IRFU’s focus became too based on Leinster to the detriment of the other three provinces. But, however much you dress it up, Munster have inexorably become less productive. The Munster quintet contain two world-class players, Peter O’Mahony and Conor Murray – 34 and 35 respectively. Each still makes Munster a better team, but Murray this week admitted he is not even considering his future beyond this season, and this campaign may be a last dance for the pair of them in the wake of Keith Earls, Simon Zebo and others. Of the others Tadhg Beirne is a product of the Leinster system – although where Munster would have been without him for the last seven seasons doesn’t bear thinking about. Which leaves Jack Crowley, an outhalf from Bandon, and Calvin Nash, a winger from Limerick. While there is talent coming through in the considerable ability of Brian Gleeson, Ruadhán Quinn and others, there’s no sign of Munster suddenly yielding a richer harvest. Neil Doak’s 31-man under-20s squad has a similar and familiar breakdown, with 17 Leinster players, five apiece from Munster and Ulster, three from Connacht, and one from England. Of the Munster quintet the promising ex-CBC and Constitution prop Michael Foy, now with UCC, has had his progress delayed by injury. The lock Conor Kennelly is also a product of CBC and Con, and now with Highfield. Ironically, the under-20s captain and backrower Eanna McCarthy is also a product of CBC, but seemingly didn’t fit in the Munster academy, and having been chased by the other three, pitched up in Connacht and Galwegians. The 19-year-old Munster academy centre Gene O’Leary Kareem is a product of Highfield and PBC, whom he captained to the Munster Schools Senior Cup final win over CBC last season. Another is centre Eoghan Smyth, a 19-year-old product of Midleton College who doubtless owes his inclusion through his eye-catching performances as an ever-present in the All-Ireland League this season with Cork Constitution. And there should be a lesson in this. The stylish Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, who has also been playing regularly in Division 1A of the AIL with Garryowen, is a product of Bantry. Admittedly, the Shannon prop Emmet Calvey and the flanker Luke Murphy, who hails from Cratloe in Clare and came through Shannon and Ardscoil Rís, were stars of last year’s under-20s team and are still eligible but currently injured. Yet there are no forwards from Limerick or its surrounding feeder area in either the Irish senior or under-20s squad, something that would have been unthinkable even 15 years ago. Back in Ireland’s 2009 Grand Slam campaign of the 40 players who were part of the Irish squad, 15 came from Munster, 12 from Leinster, eight from Ulster and five from across the water, with none from Connacht. Nine years later of the 36 players named in the original squad and four subsequent call-ups in that Grand Slam campaign, Leinster had become bulk suppliers with 19, but Munster still provided 12, with five from Ulster and four from Connacht. Talking to several well-placed people inside Munster rugby the primary problem appears to be the ongoing attempt to ape the Leinster system without having anything like similar resources and competitive standards. Thanks to the superior facilities and wages paid to coaches in Blackrock College, St Michael’s, Gonzaga et al, Leinster have a conveyor belt of ready-made talent for their academy system. Such are their numbers Leinster can afford some players slipping through the system. Some schools in Munster do put a focus on nurturing young rugby talent. For example, Johnny Holland the oversees the CBC programme and Duncan Williams is their head coach. But others depend on a perfect storm, ie Seán Skehan coaching a Glenstal team with Ben Healy, or can flit between focusing on rugby or hurling/Gaelic football. Individually the Munster clubs and schools cannot hope to emulate Leinster. Akin to Connacht, they should start working together rather than separately, and stop preventing players from continuing their playing ties with the clubs who introduced them to the game. In those vital development years of, say, 12 to 15, talented young players need specialist coaching and improved competition structures rather than being coached by voluntary teachers or PE teachers. Munster need to find a Munster way, and delve into their famed club game, where most are struggling to field second teams, or in some cases even under-20s teams. Limerick clubs won 13 of the first 19 AILs. They’ve not had one winner since Shannon in 2009. By all accounts the soap opera that is Munster is riven with divides among the clubs themselves, or the clubs and the schools. The decline in production lines from Limerick comes at a time when the squad, senior and academy, has been based exclusively in their High Performance Centre in the University of Limerick, and when Thomond Park has become Munster’s primary home more than ever. And this, of course, leads to the elephant in the room, namely the Limerick/Cork divide, and specifically the profound disenchantment and thorough disengagement within Cork. Granted, Thomond Park was being redeveloped in that 2008-09 season when Cork hosted nine Magners League matches, including the Leinster game. But the following season Cork hosted three Magners League games, against the Dragons, Edinburgh and Scarlets. Two seasons ago it was Zebre, Lions and Scarlets; last season the Dragons, Glasgow and Zebre, and this season the Ospreys’ visit for Munster’s rain-drenched 23-0 win in October will be followed by Edinburgh in February and Benetton in May. So disaffected have the Cork rugby fraternity become that many have ceased travelling to Thomond Park for games. Donal Lenihan has been banging this drum for years, and calling aloud for the festive Leinster game to be moved to Páirc Uí Chaoimh, where the games against the Crusaders and South Africa in the last two seasons drew 40,000-plus capacity crowds. This would be a significant gesture of goodwill toward Munster’s Cork following, yet apparently the excuse for not doing so was that hotel rooms were already booked for Leinster. Well, then, plan in advance. Leinster don’t have to be paid to pitch up in Cork or Limerick, whereas the Crusaders were reputedly paid €250,000 and the Springboks €280,000. Munster’s current CEO Ian Flanagan recently told the Irish Examiner that “the financials aren’t compelling” enough to switch an existing league fixture from Thomond Park to the home of Cork GAA. No doubt that went down like a lead balloon in Cork. If Leinster can move a derby to Croke Park and Connacht move one to MacHale Park then Munster can do likewise. Munster need to start thinking outside the box. The province needs a rethink and a revamp to find solutions within. They could do worse than find some overseeing role for Declan Kidney, who gets the Munster zeitgeist and the Cork-Limerick divide. In his last six seasons as head coach he took the province to their four Heineken Cup finals, and he is in Cork after his four years as director of rugby at London Irish. On this day all of this might seem ill-timed and negative. The fervent hope remains that Munster secure a home Round of 16 tie, that somehow they even earn an overdue Thomond Park quarter-final. No less than Ulster and Connacht, as Matt Williams argues elsewhere in this section, Irish rugby needs Munster remaining competitive at the elite end of European rugby. It needs a stronger Munster than its current version. The consequences of a continuing decline in how the province is run and managed would be disastrous. And not just for Munster. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: AIL preview: Trip to Young Munster a stern test for leaders St Mary’s

The leaders St Mary’s return to Tom Clifford Park for the first time in eight years with a side featuring both of their ex-Young Munster players, prolific fullback Conor Hayes and the former Munster centre Dan Goggin. The latter will be opposing his brother, Tom, who starts in the home side’s secondrow, as was the case when the sides met in round eight six weeks ago. St Mary’s prevailed that day by 26-24, with their ex-Munster centre scoring their fourth try and Hayes landing three conversions. This fixture has always had a certain resonance ever since Young Munster beat St Mary’s in a title decider at Lansdowne Road in 1993. The home side sit sixth but are only five points behind Mark McHugh’s side, who were blunted a week ago by Lansdowne. Young Munster recorded a fine derby win over Garryowen last week but Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn are travelling reserves for Munster’s Champions Cup game in Northampton, and outhalf Tony Butler is on the bench in Franklin’s Gardens. The 11th round comprises the return fixtures from the eighth round in early December, when four of the five top-flight games were decided by four points or less. The exception was Clontarf’s handsome win in Ballynahinch, and after their game in Armagh was postponed last week, they will be favourites to complete the double at Castle Avenue. As well as having the Leinster duo of Alex Soroka and Brian Deeney up front, the Clontarf team features Hugh Cooney, named this week as a development player in the Irish squad. With Jake Flannery on Ulster duty, James Humphreys reverts to outhalf for ‘Hinch, who welcome back influential centre George Pringle. Third-placed Terenure host UCD and welcome back Chris Cosgrave, who nailed the last-ditch penalty to beat the students in the corresponding clash at the Bowl. Aran Egan reverts to outhalf, while Leinster’s John McKee returns at hooker. Emmet MacMahon, forwards coach when Terenure won their maiden AIL two seasons ago, returns to Lakelands with a UCD team featuring six Leinster players, including Andrew Osborne on the wing. Fourth-placed Cork Con will look to continue their steady climb up the table when hosting Garryowen at Temple Hill, having been hard-pressed to beat the bottom-placed side 19-17 last time around. The champions have restored James Taylor at outhalf but while Garryowen welcome back loosehead George Hadden they are again without the stardust of Brian Gleeson and also fellow Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks. Lansdowne, who will be eyeing up a top four finish after last week’s win at St Mary’s put them within seven points of the playoffs, host City of Armagh on the Aviva back pitch on Sunday due to the Leinster-Bath game. Last May, Old Belvedere went to the Thomond Park back pitch and beat Shannon 46-8 in the promotion/relegation semi-final playoffs. Eight months on and the in-form Belvo return atop 1B against a Shannon side who have swiftly dropped to last in the second tier. Nenagh Ormond, just three points adrift, seek to maintain the pace in Naas, while Trinity host third-placed Old Wesley and Blackrock travel to UCC in a meeting of fourth and fifth. The free-scoring pacesetters in 2A, Corinthians and Instonians, are at home to Banbridge and Cashel, as are third and fourth placed Greystones and MU Barnhall against Ballymena and Old Crescent.

Title: ‘There’s people below in Cork who don’t want to see Sarsfields win... it’s just a jealously’ – Ben O’Connor

Photo: Damien Eagers/Sportsfile ​Standing in Croke Park last July for the 25th anniversary of Cork’s 1999 All-Ireland hurling win, Ben O’Connor remembers looking around and finding it hard to absorb that it had actually been that long since that rain-soaked day in the same stadium that was in the middle of its redevelopment phase at the time. In beating Kilkenny, Cork had ended a famine, nine years long since their previous All-Ireland title. “I said where did that time go,” he recalled. “At the time in Cork that was considered a famine. Now we’re double that and another small bit with it. Even that 1999 or early 2000s team [which went on to win two subsequent All-Irelands in 2004 and 2005], there was a lot thought of them because they were the last team to win. It would be nice now if a new crop of fellas could be talked about.” That Liam MacCarthy Cup famine now runs parallel with the county’s All-Ireland club famine too. Look back at the history of the competition since its inception for the 1970/’71 season and you get a sense of just how dominant Cork club teams were in those early years. Tipperary’s Roscrea won the inaugural competition in 1971 but after that it was the preserve of three Cork city clubs, Glen Rovers, Blackrock and St Finbarr’s for seven of the next eight years, only interrupted by Kilkenny’s James Stephens. But since then the flow of the 1970s has become a trickle and just two All-Ireland title wins have been celebrated on Leeside, Midleton in 1988 and Newtownshandrum in 2004. In the meantime, Kilkenny and Galway have forged ahead with 14 titles each, five ahead of Cork’s collective nine. Cork clubs have struggled to make any mark at provincial level in recent years so Sarsfields’ progress to tomorrow’s All-Ireland final against Dublin’s Na Fianna is an outlier, even more pronounced because they lost to Ballygunner by 17 points in the 2023 Munster Championship. Sarsfields selector Diarmuid O'Sullivan celebrating after the All-Ireland club SHC semi-final win over Slaughtneil. Photo: Piaras Ó Mídheach/Sportsfile O’Connor and twin brother Jerry were chief architects behind Newtownshandrum’s 2004 win as they developed a possession game that wasn’t to everyone’s taste at the time, one which Cork modified to win those last two All-Ireland titles. Since then, the All-Ireland club championship has been a wasteland for Cork senior clubs with just Newtonshandrum returning to a final, which they lost to a Joe Canning-inspired Portumna, two years later. “It doesn’t happen too often,” acknowledged O’Connor, who is full of admiration for Sarsfields because of how they turned the 2023 result around against Ballygunner. He earnestly hopes there’ll be no more talk of Newtownshandrum as the last Cork champions after this weekend. “They could have downed tools, the same as they did last year,” he said. “They won the county last year and got that hiding off Ballygunner. They didn’t want that happening again and they got their bit of luck along the way. “I think they’ve got better every day they’ve played since. Hopefully on Sunday there’ll be no more talk of Newtown being the last team to win the All-Ireland club from Cork and they’ll be talking about someone else. It’s great for Cork hurling. After Watergrasshill [All-Ireland intermediate champions] and Russell Rovers [All-Ireland junior finalists] last weekend, it would be nice to finish the whole thing off with Sars lifting the trophy.” O’Connor would love to see it and so would many others in Cork but not everyone, he acknowledged, as the competitive fires burn intensely. “There are people below in Cork who don’t want to see Sars winning. There are people above in Tyrone who don’t want to see Errigal Ciarán winning. It’s just a jealousy, I suppose. I’m a Corkman so I want to see Cork teams winning everything, no matter what they’re at. Local rivalry has to be put aside at this stage. They’re representing Cork, they’re the Cork team at the weekend so everybody should be behind Sars.” O’Connor managed Cork to the All-Ireland U-20 title in 2023 and has stepped away from the role now. But some of those players that played under him are graduating and as the swell of talent in Cork rises, O’Connor is sure that a Sarsfields win tomorrow would be a further catalyst. “It shows that the team that has won your county title is the best in the country so why can’t every other team below there think the same? The draws for the club championship have been made in Cork and there are at least four teams saying, ‘We’re better than Sars’. Now, Sars are in an All-Ireland final yet they’re saying that they’re better than them, so it’s bound to drive things on a small bit. I just think it’s great that we have a team involved at this stage.” O’Connor has no immediate ambition to return to inter-county management and cautions about the time pressure being placed on the best players now because of the split season. “Take Jack O’Connor. He loses the All-Ireland final [as part of the Cork squad], he gets a week to drown his sorrows then he’s back in with the club, he’s going then until Sunday with Sars. He’ll probably get two weeks off and then he’s back in with Cork. “For a fella that got beaten in the semi-final of a Cork championship, he’s finished at the end of September, he’s probably back training two weeks after that. So the good fella gets no break whereas before, when you had seasons [running] together, you had some chance. The better fellas have no chance. It’s great for the club player because his year is done out for him, clubs aren’t playing championship until August.” Ben (right) and Jerry O'Connor with the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2004. Photo: Damien Eagers/Sportsfile Ben and Jerry O’Connor feature in one of the Laochra Gael programmes that are being broadcast from next week on TG4 and Ben said it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. “Looking down the road, I have three small ones and Jerry has three small ones, so it’s nice for them to be able to see the few clips and be able to see what went on back in the day,” he said. “They [the children] haven’t a clue really. They know we played hurling and they’re made for hurling themselves, but they don’t know the full story of everything so it’s nice to be able to look back. And you get this done for you. You don’t have to go and do it yourself so I suppose that’s a nice side of it.” The telepathy between the twins is a feature of their programme but Ben is adamant their understanding never compromised a decision made on the field. “I got to know his game, he got to know mine,” said Ben of Jerry. “I still like to think in a game that if the right thing to do was pass the ball, whether it was Jerry there or someone else there, I’d make the right decision. I wouldn’t like to think ‘I’ll pass it because it is Jerry’. And I know I didn’t. If it was the right thing to do, it was the right thing to do.”​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Title: Unusual Situation in Gold & Silver Market May Spark Big Price Moves

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 4:16:40 PM PST by delta7 The monetary metals pulled back sharply yesterday but have entered Tuesday on stable footing. Silver is trading at $29.90 –and gold is $2,674. The ongoing volatility is a reflection of uncertainty in the gold and silver markets globally, including fears of import tariffs from the incoming Trump administration. If Trump slaps a tariff of, say, 10% on precious metals coming into the U.S., that would have a huge impact. 10% on silver would amount to $3 per ounce! As a result of this worry, the price of gold and silver – as traded on the New York futures market – has risen sharply above the prices for the same metals seen simultaneously in other markets across the globe. In silver, for example, the spread between London spot and New York futures has recently reached as high as $1 per ounce! This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions. Or get it into the right form. This situation could lead to big price swings and even a major short squeeze event in gold and/or silver, so you can be confident we'll keep our customers updated at MoneyMetals.com.

As a result of this worry, the price of gold and silver – as traded on the New York futures market – has risen sharply above the prices for the same metals seen simultaneously in other markets across the globe. In silver, for example, the spread between London spot and New York futures has recently reached as high as $1 per ounce! This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions. Or get it into the right form. This situation could lead to big price swings and even a major short squeeze event in gold and/or silver, so you can be confident we'll keep our customers updated at MoneyMetals.com.

Title: Somnium VR1 Price Increases Bring Base Model To €3000
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/somnium-vr1-price-increases/
Time Published: 2025-01-17T23:08:00Z
Full Content:
Somnium VR1, the European wide field of view PC VR headset, has just received a price increase for all three remaining variants, bringing the entry price to €3000. It comes two weeks after the company announced it had started shipping to the US, and simplified its lineup down from seven consumer variants to three. Somnium is a Czech startup previously solely focused on its social VR platform Somnium Space. But in late 2021 it announced the Somnium VR1 headset with a monster spec sheet for the time, in partnership with VRgineers - known for its ultra-high end XTAL headsets for enterprise. Originally Somnium VR1 was pitched as a hybrid headset with standalone capabilities via an onboard Snapdragon XR2 chipset, but that idea was ditched in 2022 to focus on making it a solely PC VR headset instead. VR1 uses the same 2880×2880 QD-LCD w/ Mini-LED panels used in Pimax Crystal. The displays have 20000:1 contrast via local dimming, 100% NTSC color gamut, and support 72Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz refresh rate, with an "experimental" 144Hz mode available too. The output brightness to your eyes is 210 nits, around double that of Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. Those displays are paired with large dual-element aspheric lenses Somnium claims deliver a field of view of around 130° horizontal and 105° vertical. That's wider than any other VR headset on the market. Pimax "5K" and "8K" were even wider, but are no longer in production and had significant distortion in the periphery. This focus on expanding field of view is why Somnium VR1 is so bulky in an era of far slimmer pancake lens headsets. Somnium says the price increases are due to production being "far more complex than initially anticipated". Specifically, the company is experiencing quality yield issues with its displays and lenses, requiring complex QA and rejecting some component stock. As for new VR1 orders placed today, Somnium says those will take one to two months to ship, and that it is "trying to accelerate production as fast as we can to meet the demand". Later this year, it plans to start selling spare parts for Somnium VR1 to enable self-repairs. We went hands-on with Somnium VR1 back in July.

Title: The Tennessee-BlackRock Settlement: A Win for Transparency and Investor Interests
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/17/the-tennessee-blackrock-settlement-a-win-for-transparency-and-investor-interests/

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In a high-stakes showdown that captured the attention of investors nationwide, the State of Tennessee has reached a settlement with BlackRock, Inc. regarding its use of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in the management of U.S. mutual funds. While skeptics might dismiss the agreement as symbolic, a closer inspection reveals an important victory for investor rights, transparency, and accountability in the financial sector. At the heart of this case was the assertion that BlackRock had violated Tennessee’s Trade Practices Act (TCPA) by failing to adequately disclose the role of ESG factors in its decision-making processes. ESG investing has been a polarizing topic, with proponents hailing it as a forward-thinking approach to sustainable finance and critics decrying it as a distraction from fiduciary duties. The lawsuit filed by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti aimed to address these tensions, arguing that investors deserved clarity and honesty about the criteria shaping their portfolios. This agreement serves as a blueprint for restoring trust in financial institutions. By addressing the controversies surrounding ESG investing, the settlement strikes a balance between innovation and accountability. It neither demonizes ESG principles nor gives them free rein; instead, it holds fund managers to their core responsibility—maximizing shareholder value. Furthermore, the settlement demonstrates the power of state-level legal actions to influence corporate governance on a national scale. As more states scrutinize the practices of financial giants, the message is clear: investors deserve honesty, transparency, and accountability. Some critics may argue that the settlement lets BlackRock off the hook by dismissing the claims without prejudice. However, this overlooks the significant commitments BlackRock has made to reform its practices. The settlement includes clear mechanisms for reasserting the dismissed claims if BlackRock fails to comply, ensuring that the agreement has teeth. Moreover, by requiring BlackRock to implement these reforms over three years, the settlement allows for meaningful, lasting changes rather than short-term fixes. The inclusion of audits and public disclosures further bolsters its enforceability. In an era where ESG controversies dominate headlines, this settlement offers a refreshing approach. It empowers investors with the information they need to make informed decisions while holding financial institutions accountable for their actions. As other states consider similar measures, Tennessee has set a precedent that balances innovation with investor protection. While no settlement is perfect, this agreement represents a significant victory for transparency, accountability, and the integrity of financial markets. For Tennessee investors—and indeed, all investors across the country—it’s a step in the right direction. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

BlackRock and the state of Tennessee on Friday reached a settlement over a lawsuit claiming the asset management firm downplayed how large a role environmental, social and governance proposals made in its investment process. The settlement is another win for red states that have launched attacks against companies with ESG goals — including DEI initiatives, a subsect which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion – claiming the proposals are counteractive to shareholder interest. “BlackRock’s stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. Under the settlement, BlackRock will be subject to increased transparency, regular audits, compliance trainings, cooperation with the attorney general, improved investor communications and a commitment to financial interests. The suit – which was filed in 2023 by the state of Tennessee – accused BlackRock of making “misleading” statements on how strongly ESG proposals steered its investments. BlackRock has dismissed the claim, arguing it accurately discloses its investment practices. “We’re pleased to resolve this matter,” a BlackRock spokesperson told The Post in a statement. “BlackRock has consistently acted in the best interests of our clients, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact through even greater transparency about our practices.” The settlement did not result in a penalty, fine or admission of wrongdoing on BlackRock’s part. Last week, a federal judge ruled that American Airlines violated federal law by allowing its 401(k) manager BlackRock to weigh ESG factors in its investments. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas said the air carrier violated its fiduciary duty of loyalty. Friday’s settlement could be an indicator for other cases involved in the Republican-led war against ESG investing. A coalition of 11 states led by Texas slapped BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. with a lawsuit in November accusing the firms of operating as an “investment cartel.” The suit accused the asset managers of colluding to acquire stakes in coal producers and then push ESG goals – which hurt coal production, sent electricity costs up and increased profits for the firm. BlackRock has dismissed the suit as “baseless” claims that go against “common sense.” “The suggestion that BlackRock has invested money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense,” the company previously said.

Amazon is laying off around 200 employees in its Fashion and Fitness group in the US, Business Insider reported. The company confirmed the layoffs, which primarily impacted employees based in San Diego, a group known internally as F2. The decision follows a restructuring effort to optimize team structures for better innovation and customer focus. “We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities. As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” The layoff decision is not connected to the discontinuation of its “Try Before You Buy” program, which allowed customers to try on clothing and footwear before making a purchase. The Try Before You Buy service, launched in 2018, was shuttered earlier this month. However, Amazon clarified that the program’s closure and the job cuts are separate. Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness group is responsible for curating and marketing apparel, footwear, accessories, and fitness equipment. The company continues to explore ways to expand its apparel and fashion categories, despite the challenges of customers often preferring to try items before purchasing. The layoffs signal ongoing internal adjustments in Amazon in a competitive market. Amazon is discontinuing its “Try Before You Buy” service, a program that allowed Prime members to try on select apparel, shoes, and accessories at home before completing their purchase. The company confirmed that the last day customers can place orders using the service will be January 31. The service, launched in 2018 after initial testing under the name Prime Wardrobe in 2017, enabled customers to order up to six clothing items for a trial period. After receiving the merchandise, shoppers had seven days to return any unwanted items without incurring charges. In a statement, Amazon explained that the decision was made due to the program’s limited reach and the increasing use of AI-powered tools to help customers select the right items. “Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option,” an Amazon spokesperson said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mitek Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MITK) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Additional offerings include ID_CLOUD, IDLive Face, IDLive Doc, and IDVoice to combat fraud and better security. The company aims to strengthen its AI-powered solutions and upgrade fraud and identity detection to tackle rising digital fraud. The company not only has AI-driven solutions but is also focused on combating rising AI-driven threats and deepfakes. At its latest earnings call, the company CEO Ed West said: “Mitek (NASDAQ:MITK) is a trusted leader in computer vision and identity-related application of AI and fraud prevention. We revolutionized check processing with our mobile check deposit solution and we continue to push boundaries with innovations in identity verification, authentication and fraud management” He also added: “Customers are increasingly seeking integrated platforms, not just point solutions, to combat rising AI-driven threats and deepfakes. Our fraud platform stands out with proprietary capabilities with an established track record of leading in trusted third-party and U.S. government-led benchmarks. In December, Allen Klee of Maxim Group maintained a Buy rating on Mitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) with a $13 price target, emphasizing its strong financial performance and strategic focus. The company outperformed expectations in F4Q24, achieving significant revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and EPS growth, driven by strong results in its Identity and Deposits segments. Overall, MITK ranks 22nd on our list of the 59 AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of MITK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MITK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Tennessee Attorney General settles ESG dispute with BlackRock

By Niket Nishant and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to new disclosure requirements about its use of sustainable-investment factors as part of a legal settlement with Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, his office said on Friday. The resolution is the latest step by New York-based BlackRock and by other firms to move away from environmental, social or governance measures. An anti-ESG backlash has gathered force among Skrmetti and other Republican politicians including incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Skrmetti sued BlackRock late in 2023, alleging it did not adequately disclose its use of ESG factors and that it overstated their financial benefits. Although BlackRock did not admit to wrongdoing or pay fines as part of the deal, Skrmetti told Reuters in an interview that the agreement was significant as a mark of the times. "BlackRock was at the heart of this, the biggest asset manager in the world, and their willingness to undertake this settlement speaks to the end of the ESG moment," he said. The company's steps like quitting an investor climate group on Jan. 9 "certainly helped solidify" the agreement, he said. BlackRock, with some $11.6 trillion under management, said it was pleased to resolve the dispute with Tennessee. "BlackRock has consistently acted in the best interests of our clients, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact through even greater transparency about our practices," the company said in a statement sent by a representative. Among other things, BlackRock agreed to disclosure requirements such as giving quarterly, not annual, details about votes it cast, and to provide a rationale when its non-ESG funds cast proxy votes against management recommendations on environmental or social matters. BlackRock already provides many such details on its website. Skrmetti said the formalization of the disclosures creates a "comprehensive compliance regime" and that the lack of financial penalties helped speed the deal. ESG investing enjoyed a run as a hot area of finance but investors pulled back in recent years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine surged energy prices and hurt the relative performance of technology-heavy ESG funds that often avoid fossil fuel stocks. Meanwhile Republicans, often from energy-producing states, have increased pressure on BlackRock and rivals like Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) over the issue. Fink said in 2023 that he had stopped using the term ESG as it had become too politicized.

Title: Vanguard fined more than $100 million by SEC over violations involving target date retirement funds

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Asset management giant Vanguard has been fined more than $100 million to settle charges related to disclosures around target date investment funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday. The alleged violations stem from a 2020 change where Vanguard lowered the minimum investment requirement for its institutional target date funds. The SEC order found that the change spurred redemptions as Vanguard customers moved from other target date funds into the institutional versions, creating taxable distributions for some of the remaining shareholders. The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. “The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments,” the SEC said in a press release. The fine of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the fine without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, reporting more than $10 trillion of global assets as of last November. The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. “Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We’re pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options,” Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The fine highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC. Vanguard then had to sell the underlying assets in the investor share class of the funds to meet the redemptions from departing investors, the SEC found. As a result, shareholders who stayed in the investor share class were subject to a large capital gains distribution — and a tax liability if they held the fund in a taxable brokerage account, according to the order. Normally, target date funds remain in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts — which would avoid a tax hit from a large capital gains distribution. The SEC’s order said Vanguard’s investor-series target funds saw $130 billion in redemptions from December 2020 to October 2021, up from $41 billion in the same period a year prior. Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. The fine announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in. In 2023, Vanguard was fined $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority related to problems with account statements for money market funds in 2019 and 2020. The alleged violations took place under former CEO Tim Buckley. The current CEO, Salim Ramji, joined Vanguard from BlackRock in 2024. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: T Stamp Inc. (IDAI): AI Identity Verification Under $2 Billion Market Cap

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where T Stamp Inc. (NASDAQ:IDAI) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, biometrics, cryptography, and data mining to detect and prevent identity fraud, safeguard sensitive data, and improve digital service accessibility. Its technology combines Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token and various biometric or identifying data sources. On January 6, T Stamp (NASDAQ:IDAI) announced a strategic partnership with Qenta Inc. As part of the agreement, Qenta is spinning off its Goldstar KYC technology into a new subsidiary, QID Technologies LLC, with Trust Stamp holding a 10% stake in the new entity. Trust Stamp has also granted QID a non-exclusive license for its AI-powered identity technologies in exchange for a $1 million license fee, payable in three installments over Q1 2025. Additionally, QID will contract with Trust Stamp for business and product development services related to identity and privacy solutions, with monthly service fees starting January 1, 2025, capped at $3.6 million annually. As a 10% shareholder in QID, Trust Stamp expects to receive a net cash inflow of $3.3 million from the projected $3.6 million in billed revenue. Overall, IDAI ranks 58th on our list of AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of IDAI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Traders Ditch Emerging Markets in Rocky Start of the Year

(Bloomberg) -- Investors are yanking money from emerging markets at the start of 2025 as they weigh how many of Donald Trump’s threats will become policy upon his return to the White House next week. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity Money managers pulled $8.5 billion from funds dedicated to developing-world stocks and bonds so far this year, according a JPMorgan Chase & Co. report citing EPFR data. The selloff has hit assets across the globe from Chile’s peso to stocks in China and India to sovereign bonds from Romania and El Salvador. The outflows mark the continuation of a trend that has beset the asset class for the past three years. Traders have already been struggling to make a case for emerging markets while the US economy hums along, the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts dims and some of the biggest developing economies, from China to Brazil, struggle. Trump’s inauguration on Monday poses a fresh set of risks. The Republican president-elect has doubled down on his proposal to impose sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world, while adding threats to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland. “It’s hard for the market to take big bets in front of big events,” said Pablo Goldberg, a portfolio manager at BlackRock in New York. “Markets don’t like uncertainty, and right now we’re still in a very uncertain period.” The start of the year has been bumpy, with an index of emerging stocks sinking into a correction in early January and dollar bonds posting losses. Most emerging currencies are down versus the dollar this year, with some including the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real trading at or near record lows as changing bets on US rate cuts and Trump policies boost the dollar. Asian central banks, which have been shielding their currencies through interventions in the face of the greenback’s relentless rally, are beginning to rethink their strategy, considering rate cuts to boost their economies instead of focusing on currency management. ‘Highly Uncertain’ Carlos Legaspy, chief executive officer at Insight Securities, said investors are opting for safety, at least until they see how the early days of Trump’s second presidency plays out. “I’d rather buy a a two-year Treasury with a yield near 4%,” he said, “then to wait and give Trump 100 days to see if he starts delivering on his threats.” Arif Joshi, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, said he’s expecting the changes in trade and tax policy to be significant during Trump’s second term. “The magnitude and timing of those changes are highly uncertain,” he said. “It’s not wise at this time to have duration or FX risk in emerging markets.” The Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Korean won are particularly vulnerable and could weaken as much as 10% should Trump impose single-sector tariffs, according to Barclays strategists led by Lefteris Farmakis. During the campaign, Trump floated minimum tariffs from 10% to 20% on all imported goods, and 60% or higher on China, causing a selloff in EM assets. He also caused a rout in Panama bonds when he suggested the US should reassert control of the canal — one of the most important waterways in the world — if the nation didn’t cut transit fees for American vessels. The unpredictable nature of the announcements — assets have posted harsh swings several times in the past two weeks amid Trump social media comments, including this Friday — has prompted Michael Cirami to instruct his junior staff to shout any time Trump mentions a country for the first time. “He could wake up in the middle of the night and mention a country that you were not expecting him to, and all of a sudden, the situation’s changed,” said Cirami, who helps manage $3 billion in mostly fixed-income assets at Artisan Partners. “We need to be on our guard.” --With assistance from Andras Gergely, Carolina Wilson, Selcuk Gokoluk, Winnie Hsu and Catherine Bosley.

The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. "The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," the SEC said in a press release. The payment of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. Vanguard is one of the world's largest asset managers, reporting more than $10 trillion of global assets as of November. The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. "Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We're pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options," Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The payment highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC.

Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. Jeff DeMaso, who specializes in tracking Vanguard at Independent Vanguard Adviser, said he believed the $106 million settlement was the largest ever regulatory payment imposed on the Pennsylvania-based asset manager. The settlement announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in. In 2023, Vanguard was fined $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority related to problems with account statements for money market funds in 2019 and 2020.

Title: Vanguard settles SEC charges over misleading statements for $106.41 million

Investing.com -- The Vanguard Group, Inc. has agreed to pay $106.41 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over misleading statements related to capital gains distributions and tax consequences for retail investors. The funds in question are Vanguard Investor Target (NYSE:TGT) Retirement Funds (Investor TRFs) held in taxable accounts. The settlement amount will be distributed to affected investors. The SEC order, issued today, reveals that Vanguard had announced on December 11, 2020, that the minimum initial investment amount for Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement Funds (Institutional TRFs) was reduced from $100 million to $5 million. In the months following this announcement, a significant number of retirement plan investors moved their investments from Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs due to lower expenses. To meet the demand for these redemptions, the Investor TRFs had to sell underlying assets with gains, given the rising financial markets that had recovered from pandemic lows. As a result, retail investors in the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities, thereby missing out on potential compounding growth of their investments. The SEC order also found that the prospectuses of Vanguard Investor TRFs, distributed in 2020 and 2021, were materially misleading. They stated that the funds’ distributions may be taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, and that capital gains distributions could vary significantly from year to year due to the funds’ “normal” investment activities and cash flows. However, the prospectuses did not disclose the potential for increased capital gains distributions resulting from the redemptions of fund shares by newly eligible investors switching from the Investor TRFs to the Institutional TRFs. The SEC order also found that Vanguard failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures to prevent violations related to the accuracy of the funds’ disclosures. Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit, emphasized the importance of accurate information about capital gains and tax implications for investors saving for their retirements. He stated that firms must ensure that they accurately describe to investors the potential risks and consequences associated with their investments. The settlement resolves the SEC’s investigation and parallel investigations of Vanguard announced today by the Office of the New York Attorney General, the Connecticut Department of Banking, and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General on behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association. The SEC’s order finds that Vanguard violated the Advisers Act and caused violations of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. Vanguard has agreed to be censured, cease and desist from future violations, and pay $18.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This payment will be deemed satisfied by the payment of $92.91 million in relief ordered by the states’ settlements and a $13.5 million civil penalty, for a total amount of $106.41 million to be distributed to affected investors through a Fair Fund. This amount is in addition to $40 million that Vanguard agreed to pay to settle an investor class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. If this settlement is terminated or rejected, the $40 million will be added to the Fair Fund. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Magamorphosis Is Making Even More Sense Now

It’s becoming more and more difficult for Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s newly red-pilled CEO, to claim the rightward shift at his company reflects business as usual. According to a new report in The New York Times, Trump ally and surrogate Stephen Miller told Zuckerberg in December that the president-elect planned to go to war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the Meta chief has now axed just ahead of Trump taking office. At the same Mar-a-Lago meeting, the Times reported, Zuckerberg blamed Meta’s progressive culture on his “close friend” and former colleague, Sheryl Sandberg. Zuckerberg reportedly “signaled” to Miller and other senior Trump advisers “that he would do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda,” according to the Times, and that in the coming months, his company would “focus solely on building tech products.” And as part of that shift, Zuckerberg reportedly added, Meta would soon announce layoffs and additional guidelines to “reset” the company’s culture. (Miller and Meta officials declined to comment to the Times.) All of those things have since come to pass, less than two months after Zuckerberg and Miller’s tête-à-tête. In addition to killing its DEI program—a move the company blamed on the shifting “policy landscape” in the US—Zuckerberg has downsized Meta’s moderation efforts, cancelled a nine-year fact-checking project and railed against the “neutering” of corporate culture on Joe Rogan’s podcast. On Wednesday, Meta also announced plans to cut five percent of its workforce, or roughly 3,600 people, though it’s not yet clear which teams will be impacted. The company’s long-time global policy chief, Nick Clegg, has already departed. The Times’ reporting sheds further light on Meta’s MAGAfication—and the larger, political realignment taking place inside Big Tech. While Silicon Valley has long served as a reliable stronghold for Democrats, many of its foremost leaders have lately cozied up to Trump and his administration. In addition to Zuckerberg, at least half a dozen prominent tech CEOs—including Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman—will attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday, Axios reported. They join Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who will sit on the inaugural dais alongside the Trump family, Elon Musk and a host of other notables. Tech executives do potentially have much to gain from a friendship with Trump: During his first term, the president-elect showed apparent preference for companies that aligned with him. His deregulatory agenda could also benefit US tech firms, which chafed under departing President Joe Biden’s approach to antitrust law, artificial intelligence and the taxation of the ultrarich. In his farewell address on Wednesday, Biden warned about the rise of “a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers” to society. “Today,” Biden said, “an oligarchy is taking shape in America … that literally threatens our entire democracy.” Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires In Memoriam: David Lynch Saw the Nightmare Beneath the American Dream See Our Predictions for This Year’s Oscar Nominations How Donald Trump’s Obsession With “Y.M.C.A.” Broke Down the Village People Why Renée Zellweger “Needed to” Stop Acting for 6 Years Burning at Both Ends: Surviving a Week in Wildfire-Torn Los Angeles MAGA-verse’s Clash of Titans: Bannon vs. Musk Prince Harry Planted a Ticking Time Bomb Under the Murdoch Empire The Best Rom-Coms of All Time From the Archive: Portraits of Picasso’s Marriage

Title: Intel stock pops 8% because someone apparently wants to buy the troubled chipmaker
URL: https://qz.com/intel-stock-rise-acquisition-ai-chips-gelsinger-1851741975
Time Published: 2025-01-17T17:02:00Z
Full Content:
Intel’s (INTC+9.18%) stock was up by more than 8% during late-morning trading on Friday after a report said the faltering chipmaker is being targeted for an acquisition. Tech newsletter SemiAccurate reported on Friday that it “was read an email about a company trying to acquire Intel, whole.” The email “took months to confirm,” SemiAccurate said, and indicated that the unnamed company aims to buy Intel’s whole business, not only parts. “Our problem was that while we knew the email was real and it said directly that the company was interested acquiring Intel, we couldn’t determine if it was a plan of action or just a CEO tossing ideas out,” SemiAccurate said. The embattled chip pioneer has seen its shares fall by around 54% in the past year. In December, Intel announced that its former chief executive Pat Gelsinger was retiring and stepping down from its board of directors. Gelsinger’s departure came amid Intel’s struggle to compete with other chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%), which has seen an astronomical rise from the artificial intelligence boom. Intel’s shares fell 27% in August after it missed revenue expectations for the second quarter and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. In September, a report said chipmaker Qualcomm was interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Intel has also worked with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+1.62%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+2.26%) on options to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips, cutting factory projects, and M&A, according to Bloomberg. The company was reportedly also in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO+0.98%) for a $5 billion investment. Meanwhile, Intel was awarded up to $7.87 billion in direct funding in November under the Chips Act. The funding will directly support Intel’s nearly $90 billion planned investment in the U.S. by the end of the decade — part a more than $100 billion expansion plan for fabrication and advanced packaging facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

Title: Amazon lays off 200 staffers from its corporate offices

Time Published: 2025-01-17T16:48:03Z
Full Content:
Amazon is laying off 200 staffers, several of them from the e-commerce firm’s fashion and fitness department, as part of an ongoing effort to streamline operations and improve efficiency, the company said. The layoffs affect workers across multiple locations in the United States, including a group in San Diego. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the job eliminations and stated that the company is restructuring its North America Stores team to enhance efficiency and innovation. “We’re always looking at our team structures to ensure we’re best set up to move fast as we innovate for customers,” the spokesperson told The Post. “We’ve adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities. As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness group oversees the curation and marketing of fashion and athletic products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, and fitness equipment. Employees in roles related to account management, merchandising and data engineering are expected to be affected. Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness business, known internally in the company as F2, has 23 current job openings across Washington, New York, and Texas, with positions spanning software development, supply chain management, sales, and product management. However, it remains unclear how many of these positions will be filled given the restructuring efforts. Despite the layoffs, Amazon stated that the shuttering of its “Try Before You Buy” program — which allowed customers to test out apparel and footwear before purchasing — was not directly related to these job cuts. The program, launched in 2018, was discontinued earlier this month. Over the past year, Amazon has implemented job reductions across multiple business units, including a significant workforce reduction at fulfillment centers last fall. CEO Andy Jassy previously stated that Amazon had undergone hundreds of operational changes to improve efficiency within its fulfillment and delivery network. Advertisement

Wall Street closed higher on Friday, pushing stocks to their first weekly advance this year, ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. President-elect Trump's inauguration is Monday, and his first days are expected to be filled with a flurry of executive orders. "Reports suggest 100 or more," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. Any signals of how Trump's proposed tariffs would be implemented would be carefully watched, they said. Morgan Stanley economists still think the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates at its March policy meeting after cooler inflation data earlier this week, but noted "sooner and higher-than-expected tariffs can take March off of the table." Bitcoin gained 4.95%, closing in on $105,000, in anticipation of a possible first day order by Trump. It was last at $104,949 on reports that Trump could release an executive order making crypto a national priority as soon as his new term begins. Crypto-related shares like Coinbase and Robinhood rose, too." The broad S&P 500 index closed up 1% at 5,996.71; the blue-chip Dow gained 0,77%, rising to 43,487.52; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.51% to 19,630.20. Shares of social media giants Facebook and Instagram owner Meta and YouTube parent Alphabet advanced after the Supreme Court upheld a law that could ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell it. Trump reportedly is considering an executive order to stop the ban. Meanwhile, Meta and Alphabet closed higher because they may be among the companies that could benefit from a TikTok ban, analysts said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield firmed to 4.615%. U.S. stocks notched their first weekly gain this year, with the S&P 500 and Dow logging their biggest weekly gains since November. The Nasdaq put in its best week since December. "The U.S. macro backdrop at the moment, at least per December’s data, is one that points to the ‘best of all worlds’ – higher employment, falling core inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors), and a strong consumer," said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, which offers trading services. "Not a bad inheritance for President-elect Trump to pick up on Monday." On Friday morning, December industrial production and capacity utilization both easily beat expectations. Industrial production, which measures factory output, rose 0.9% and capacity utilization, which measures how efficiently resources are used, improved to 77.6%. On a technical basis, stocks also look bullish, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist for Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. So-called sentiment indicators -- bullish or bearish -- at extreme levels are "fairly reliable contrarian indicators," Tentarelli said, and bullish sentiment for stocks currently is at the lowest level since the November 2023 major S&P 500 lows in November 2023. This should bode well for stocks, he said. "Investors tend to be most bullish at market highs and most bearish near market lows," he said. Corporate news continues to garner attention.

Title: Goldman Sachs boosts David Solomon's pay 25% — and offers a sweet stock deal to remain CEO

Goldman Sachs (GS+2.26%) is locking in CEO David Solomon for at least another five years with a sweet stock deal — along with a big, annual pay increase. The investment bank is offering Solomon 130,508 restricted stock units, valued at $80 million, with a five-year vesting period, Goldman disclosed in a regulatory filing dated Thursday. President and chief operating officer John Waldron — considered Solomon’s leading successor — received the same retention package. These so-called retention grants or RSUs are a sign that the firm plans to hold onto their executives, at least for the duration of the vesting period. That’s on top of the $39 million total compensation package given to Solomon for 2024, up a hefty 25.8% from $31 million in 2023. That puts Solomon’s pay up there with leaders at other top banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.40%) CEO Jamie Dimon, who received a $36 million compensation package in 2023, and former Morgan Stanley (MS+1.62%) CEO James Gorman, who made $37 million in his last year with the firm. Other Wall Street banks have not yet disclosed their CEO compensation for the 2024 fiscal year. Goldman attributed the pay bump to the firm’s strong performance last year, including a “significant year-over-year improvement as a result of strategic execution.” The firm also pointed to a “48% increase in stock price, a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend and 7% book value per share growth, resulting in record amount of capital returned to common shareholders in 2024.” Goldman reported Wednesday that it saw $13.87 billion in net revenues for the three months ended Dec. 31, a 23% year-over-year jump. Profit more than doubled to $4.11 billion, for the fourth quarter, from $2.01 billion a year ago. For the full year, Goldman brought in net revenues of $53.51 billion and net earnings of $14.28 billion. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: More Tech Pink Slips: Microsoft Lays Off Employees from Multiple Divisions Including Gaming

Microsoft has reportedly begun laying off employees in several key divisions, including security, sales, gaming, and devices. Business Insider reports that Microsoft, the tech giant known for its increasingly common security breaches and intimate relationship with China, is undergoing a round of layoffs that span multiple departments within the company. According to two people familiar with the matter, the job cuts are impacting teams in the security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs were small in scale but did not provide specific numbers. The spokesperson also emphasized that these layoffs are separate from the recent job cuts targeting underperforming employees across the company. One of the individuals with knowledge of the situation revealed that employees in Microsoft’s security unit began receiving notifications about the layoffs on Tuesday. The security division is led by Charlie Bell, a former top cloud executive at Amazon who made a surprising move to Microsoft in 2021 to spearhead a revamped cybersecurity effort. Microsoft has been placing a strong emphasis on security in recent years, particularly after facing a series of security issues, including what the Department of Homeland Security described as “a cascade of security failures” that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers. In response, the company expanded its Secure Future Initiative last year, making security the top priority for all employees. The initiative was reinforced by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in an email to employees, stating, “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security.” The layoffs in the security division raise questions about the company’s ongoing commitment to prioritizing security and addressing past vulnerabilities. It remains to be seen how these job cuts will impact Microsoft’s overall security strategy and its ability to deliver on the promises made through the Secure Future Initiative. In addition to the security team, the layoffs are also affecting employees in the experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions. These departments play crucial roles in Microsoft’s product development, customer relationships, and entertainment offerings. The extent of the impact on these teams and the specific roles affected have not been disclosed. Read more at Business Insider here.

Title: Amazon to lay off 200 people in its North America retail operations

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said it is cutting a small number of roles after a routine evaluation of its team structures and ability to “move fast.” Amazon has eliminated roles across its retail team in North America, impacting about 200 people in both physical store and e-commerce operations, the company confirmed Thursday. The cuts are being made as part of the company’s regular evaluation of its team structures “to ensure we’re best set up to move fast as we innovate for customers,” according to an Amazon spokesperson. “We’ve adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities,” the spokesperson said by email. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.” This downsizing is unrelated to Amazon’s decision to end its Try Before You Buy program, a service that allows a trial period for certain apparel, footwear and accessories. In that case, the company said that more people are increasingly using tech that allows them to get a sense of how items fit before they place an order. Last year the e-commerce giant also announced layoffs in its retail division. In January 2024 that included several hundred roles in its Alexa team and several others in its Buy With Prime team. The previous year the company announced more substantial job cuts, also mostly in retail. Overall in the industry, job cuts spiked last month, although retailers are also still hiring, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

A fashion mogul has gained more wealth this year than Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or anyone else on the global rich list. Bernard Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has become about $14 billion richer already in 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He leapfrogged Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison on Thursday to take fourth place on Bloomberg's rich list with an estimated $190 billion fortune, adding $15 billion to his net worth in just one day. The luxury tycoon has gained more wealth this year than Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who was up nearly $12 billion at Thursday's market close, and the "Donald of Dubai" Hussain Sajwani, up around $10 billion. Zuckerberg and Musk are the next-biggest gainers. The Meta and Tesla CEOs have added around $9 billion and $7 billion to their respective fortunes in just over two weeks, respectively. Arnault's net worth soared on Thursday as LVMH stock surged 9% to close at its highest price since September. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. The shares jumped on hopes of a rebound in luxury demand after rival Richemont — the owner of brands like Cartier and Chloé — reported record quarterly sales with around 20% growth across Europe, the Americas, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa. Consumer appetite for pricey products came roaring back after the pandemic as people resumed traveling and shopping again. But the luxury business has struggled more recently as brisk inflation, higher interest rates, and economic fears have dampened demand even among well-heeled buyers. Arnault, nicknamed the "Wolf in Cashmere," was ranked as the world's richest person last March with a $230 billion-plus fortune, but his net worth shrank by over $50 billion by December as LVMH stock tumbled. Despite his latest gains, Arnault is still less than half as wealthy as Musk, worth $439 billion. Even accounting for Arnault's wealth decline, the world's 10 richest people added more than $500 billion to their combined fortunes in 2024, boosting their total worth to over $2 trillion. The group benefited from the buzz around artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, an improved US economic outlook, and hopes that Donald Trump's planned tax cuts and deregulation as president will boost corporate profits.

Title: What's In Store For Merck Stock In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/17/whats-in-store-for-merck-stock-in-2025/

CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American multinational pharmaceutical company ... [+] Merck (NYSE: MRK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Merck stock (NYSE: MRK) lost about 10% in 2024, underperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which gained 23% for the year. Despite strong performances from other pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly stock (up 31%) and AbbVie stock(up 15%), Merck’s stock performance has been muted. This is attributed to declining sales of its blockbuster HPV vaccine – Gardasil – and an increased competition for some of its drugs, including Januvia. As an aside, new gaming products can be impactful. See Will New Switch Give A Boost To Nintendo Stock? In this note, while we briefly touch upon Merck’s performance in 2024, we focus on the impact on MRK stock and how 2025 could turn out. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Three trends were clearly visible for Merck in 2024. Firstly, the cash cow – Keytruda – continued to gain market share with approval in more indications. Keytruda’s last twelve-month sales now stand at a whopping $28 billion, compared to $25 billion in 2023. Secondly, the next best-selling product – Gardasil – faced headwinds in China, resulting in its sales falling in the recent quarters. The last-twelve month period sales of $9 billion align with the figure reported in 2023. This comes after a stellar 31.5% annual average growth rate Gardasil posted in the last three years. A crackdown on the healthcare industry in China has impacted on the overall vaccination rate in China. Lastly, it saw an improvement in gross margins, thanks to lower royalty rates for Keytruda and Gardasil. 2024 was also the year where Merck looked at inorganic growth to expand its pharmaceuticals and animal health business. It acquired Elanco’s aqua business for $1.3 billion, Harpoon Therapeutics for $680 million, LaNova Medicines for $588 million, Curon for $750 million, and EyeBio for $1.3 billion, among others. Merck may continue to eye inorganic growth to combat with the fall in sales, when Keytruda sees biosimilar competition (likely in 2029). It will be a massive gap to bridge, given that Keytruda is one of the top-selling drugs globally. MRK stock declined gradually from levels of $110 in early January last year to $99 by the end of 2024. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in MRK stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 2% in 2021, 49% in 2022, 1% in 2023, and -6% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could MRK face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Merck’s Valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 30% upside from its current market price of $100. At its current levels, MRK stock is trading at 4x trailing revenues, compared to the stock’s average P/S ratio of 4.5x over the last three years. 2025 is likely going to be better for Merck. Keytruda is expected to continue to lead the growth, with its approval for more indications lately. However, Gardasil’s decline in China may continue to weigh on the company’s vaccine sales in 2025. Merck’s diabetes drugs – Januvia and Janumet – are likely to see increased competition. The company’s animal health business is likely to benefit from increased pet ownership in the U.S. We expect the company to maintain its higher gross margins on the back of better product mix. Merck may also secure the regulatory approval for clesrovimab – an antibody for RSV treatment in infants. If approved, clesrovimab has the potential to garner $4 billion in annual peak sales. The U.S. FDA has set a deadline of June 10 to make a decision on approval of clesrovimab. Overall, MRK stock looks like it will have more positives to aid it in 2025. With its stock trading at 4x trailing revenues, we think the potential headwinds for Gardasil are largely priced in. While MRK stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Merck’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts.

The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival, as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports and eyed likely policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up slightly in morning trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs.

Title: Americans keep swiping: Users scramble onto rival apps before TikTok's sell-or-ban deadline

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention. "The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees," one former Googler told BI. 1. Nonregrettable attrition (noun): a euphemistic term for layoffs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. But whether it's "rightsizing," "streamlining," or Meta's recent buzzphrase "nonregrettable attrition," the corporate lingo of job cuts doesn't soften the blow to employees. 2. Justin Baldoni sues Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, claiming $400 million in damages. The "It Ends With Us" director filed a 179-page suit on Thursday, accusing his costar of hijacking the movie and destroying his reputation. Lively previously accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and of trying to smear her in the press, claims that Baldoni has denied. 3. All the lonely (young) people. Gen Z adults are the loneliest and least optimistic generation, a new survey found. It's not just about young Americans having fewer social connections. More time alone and young people getting married later are also factors. Boomers, on the other hand, are on a different wavelength. The 10 safest states to live in the US, ranked.

Title: Ozempic could get cheaper as Medicare eyes drug price negotiations — and Novo Nordisk stock slips
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-ozempic-drug-price-talks-novo-nordisk-medicare-1851741842
Time Published: 2025-01-17T14:13:00Z

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said Friday that it had selected another 15 drugs for its second round of price negotiations, including the popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Negotiations between the federal government and drugmakers are slated to occur in 2025, with any new prices set to take effect in 2027. Pharmaceutical companies have until Feb. 25 to decide if they will participate in negotiations. Along with Wegovy and Ozempic, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has tapped Xtandi, Ibrance, Calquence, and Pomalyst, which are used to treat various types of cancer, for price negotiations. Otezla, a psoriasis medicine; Vraylar, an antipsychotic.; and Trelegy Ellipta, an inhaler used to treat emphysema and asthma, were also picked. According to the CMS, the drugs selected were used by 5.3 million people with coverage under Medicare Part D between November 2023 and October 2024 to treat conditions such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. They also accounted for about $41 billion in total gross covered under Medicare Part D, or about 14% of all costs, during that time period. “Last year, we proved that negotiating for lower drug prices works,” Xavier Becerra, the outgoing head of HHS, said in a statement. “Now we plan to build on that record by negotiating for lower prices for 15 additional important drugs for seniors.” The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by Congress in 2022, allowed the CMS to negotiate the price for brand name drugs that make up most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending. HHS in August announced lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations. The selected drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending in 2023, according to HHS. The negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%. Read More: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Novo Nordisk (NVO-5.10%), the company behind both Ozempic and Wegovy, had expected Ozempic to be included in the second round of price negotiations. Its drugs have become incredibly popular as Americans turn to GLP-1 medications to help them lose weight. Wegovy has also been approved for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes, while studies have found these dugs can help with several other conditions. Novo Nordisk saw its stock fall by more than 4% in pre-market trading Friday. Shares are also being affected by headline results from a new study that found patients who take a higher dose of Wegovy lost more weight than those on a lower dose without experiencing an increase in side effects. The study found that people who took a 7.2-milligram dose lost an average of 20.7% of their weight over 72 weeks. Patients who took a 2.4-milligram dose of the semaglutide lost 17.5% of their weight, while people given a placebo lost just 2.4% of their weight over that time. Over 33% of participants who took the higher dose also recorded a weight loss of 25% or more, compared to 16.7% of participants with the lower dose. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” Novo Nordisk’s head of development, Martin Holst Lange, said in a statement. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

January 17, 2025 07:11 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 17 January 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from STEP UP, a phase 3b trial in the global STEP programme. STEP UP is a 72-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once weekly. The trial included 1,407 randomised adults with obesity. All treatment arms were in conjunction with lifestyle intervention. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 72 with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 113 kg, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 20.7% after 72 weeks compared to a reduction of 17.5% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.4% with placebo. In addition, 33.2% of those who received semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a weight loss of 25% or more after 72 weeks, compared to 16.7% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 0.0% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with semaglutide 7.2 mg achieved a superior weight loss of 18.7% compared to a reduction of 15.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.9% with placebo. In the trial, semaglutide 7.2 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “Results from STEP UP further strengthen the clinical profile of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity, in addition to the health benefits already established with Wegovy®, including cardiovascular risk reduction as seen in SELECT”. The results from the second semaglutide 7.2 mg phase 3 trial, STEP UP T2D, in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity are expected within the next few months. Detailed results from the STEP UP trial are expected to be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About the STEP UP trialsNovo Nordisk has initiated two trials investigating the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2mg, STEP UP and STEP UP T2D. The 72-week STEP UP trial was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of semaglutide 7.2 mg with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 1,407 adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and without diabetes were included in the trial. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. Key secondary endpoints included number of participants achieving 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% weight loss, respectively. The ongoing 72-week STEP UP T2D trial will investigate semaglutide 7.2 mg in 512 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with the primary objective to demonstrate superiority of semaglutide 7.2 mg against placebo on weight loss. About Wegovy® (semaglutide 2.4 mg)Semaglutide 2.4 mg is marketed under the brand name Wegovy®. In the EU, Wegovy® is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition. In the EU, Wegovy® is also indicated for paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and gender (obesity) and body weight above 60 kg. The clinical section of the label also includes data showing the benefits of Wegovy® in reducing the risk of MACE, improving HFpEF-related symptoms and physical function, as well as reducing pain related to knee osteoarthritis. In the US, Wegovy® is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, as well as to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.

Louis Carter: CEO of Best Practice Institute, creator of Most Loved Workplace®, author of Change Champions & In Great Company (McGraw Hill). When discussing drivers of stock performance, many factors come to mind—market conditions, financial performance and strategic communications, among others. However, even the most compelling good news doesn't always translate to stock price increases. A crucial yet often overlooked factor is what I call "leadership magnetism": the ability of a leader to build trust, emotional alignment and shared purpose with their stakeholders. Leadership magnetism refers to the gravitational pull a leader creates through their actions, behaviors and communications. It isn't about charisma or personality—it's about building authentic connections that attract, align and inspire stakeholders, from employees to investors. Leaders with strong magnetism can amplify the impact of strategic announcements, driving enthusiasm and financial returns. When leadership magnetism is weak, however, even breakthrough announcements can fail to move markets, as eroded trust dampens investor response. Research underscores the value of leadership magnetism in organizational success. A Weber Shandwick study found that executives attribute 44% of a company's market value to the CEO's reputation. Similarly, back in 2000, a Burson-Marsteller study revealed that 45% of a company's reputation directly stems from its CEO’s standing. These findings highlight how a leader’s ability to connect emotionally and strategically with stakeholders significantly influences market outcomes. Several notable cases demonstrate how weak leadership magnetism can undermine even the most promising strategic initiatives: • WeWork's Trajectory Under Adam Neumann: Despite announcing ambitious expansion plans in 2019, WeWork's valuation plummeted from $47 billion to less than $8 billion (subscription required). As documented by the Wall Street Journal, stakeholders lost confidence in Adam Neumann's leadership due to concerns about his decision-making and governance style. Bloomberg similarly detailed how mounting concerns about Neumann's transparency eroded investor confidence​ • Meta And Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse Investment: In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced a $10 billion investment in the metaverse alongside a company rebranding. However, Meta's stock price dropped, as ongoing privacy issues and ethical controversies diminished his leadership magnetism. • GE's Strategic Pivot Under Jeff Immelt: Between 2015 and 2017, GE's stock price declined from $30.66 to $23.16 as stakeholders questioned Jeff Immelt's ability to execute a digital transformation strategy. CEOs who master leadership magnetism can transform strategic announcements into powerful market catalysts: • Microsoft And Satya Nadella: Satya Nadella’s clear vision for AI-driven growth has been instrumental in Microsoft’s financial success. Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft reported in 2024 "over $245 billion in annual revenue, marking a 16% increase year-over-year, alongside a 24% jump in operating income to over $109 billion." These achievements underscore Nadella’s ability to inspire confidence and effectively communicate strategic priorities. • Tesla And Elon Musk: Elon Musk’s ability to rally stakeholders around Tesla’s mission "to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy" exemplifies leadership magnetism. Musk’s authenticity and mission-driven strategy have been credited as key factors in Tesla’s rise to market dominance, inspiring investor confidence and stakeholder loyalty (membership required). After two and a half decades working alongside, coaching and advising CEOs, I've observed three fundamental practices that build and sustain leadership magnetism: Leadership magnetism thrives when leaders tune into their organization's pulse, strengthen it and then move on it. Magnetic leaders have an innate sense of when to listen and when to move—gathering key insights swiftly, recognizing patterns that matter and then driving consistent messages that reflect shared aspirations. Take Satya Nadella, whose leadership at Microsoft exemplifies this approach, bringing teams into the vision-building process and ensuring alignment and commitment. Magnetic leaders use stakeholder feedback as their strategic radar, not a compliance exercise. Lisa Su of AMD demonstrates this perfectly: She consistently gathers input from employees and retail investors, using it to refine AMD's strategy and foster loyalty. Elon Musk has a rare quality among CEOs: He doesn't sugarcoat things, even in tough moments. Take his 2014 interview where he opened up about Tesla's early days. Instead of spinning a success story, he admitted what was really going through his head at the time: "I thought we would most likely fail." You don't often hear billionaire founders talk about doubt like that. It's this kind of raw honesty, especially when the stakes are high, that sets his leadership style apart. Leadership magnetism is not a fixed trait—it’s a skill that can be cultivated through intentional practices. By fostering collaboration, integrating feedback and acting authentically, leaders can create a magnetic pull that inspires, aligns and drives success. As markets grow more complex and stakeholder expectations evolve, leadership magnetism will become increasingly crucial. Tomorrow's successful leaders must master the delicate balance between strategic vision and authentic connection, technical excellence and emotional intelligence, bold action and stakeholder trust. The revolution in leadership valuation is already underway. Good news alone won't drive stock price increases if stakeholders don't trust or admire the CEO. Those who embrace the power of leadership magnetism will be best positioned to thrive in this new era of market dynamics.

Title: This Wall Street quant model ranks the best to worst Magnificent 7 stocks
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-wall-street-quant-model-ranks-the-best-to-worst-magnificent-7-stocks-3818582
Time Published: 2025-01-17T11:29:13Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- Since 2020, the Magnificent 7 stocks have soared by an average of 640%, compared to approximately 100% for the S&P 500, now accounting for about 34% of the index's weight, analysts at Jefferies said in a note Friday. However, the firm highlighted that performance within the group has varied significantly, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the pack. "Not all stocks have fared equally well," Jefferies notes, highlighting that "NVDA and TSLA lead the returns." Jefferies believes the average monthly return dispersion of 25% emphasizes the importance of stock picking within this elite group. Even the weakest performer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), has risen about 140%, while NVDA surged approximately 2,200%. The Mag7 stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in 38 of the last 60 months, achieving a 63% hit rate. Despite a challenging 2022 where the Mag7 dropped around 40% as the S&P 500 fell 20%, the group rebounded strongly in 2023, buoyed by robust earnings resilience. Jefferies notes that "revisions are far better for Mag7," suggesting their dominance isn't over yet, even if "the best of Mag7 returns may be behind us." Jefferies highlighted that its Mag7 model evaluates these stocks on various factors, including growth, revisions, sell-side sentiment, momentum, valuation, yield, return on invested capital (ROIC), and R&D versus capex. The backtest results are said to be compelling: “A monthly backtest for the past 5 years shows that the best-ranked stock had average monthly return of 5.8%, vs 3.4% for all Mag7 stocks, beating the equal-weighted cohort in 34 out of 60 months." “The lowest ranked stock in our model had a monthly average return of only 2.6%, creating a long-short monthly average of 3.1% (58% hit rate),” they added. Currently, "NVDA ranks the best in our model," said Jefferies, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the best anti-momentum value play. Conversely, "MSFT ranks the lowest," while TSLA is noted as "the most volatile stock with extreme factor exposure."

Title: Microsoft’s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity The worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple. “The market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While “Microsoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.” The stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally. This reflects scrutiny on the firm’s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft’s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers. The next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one. Slower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. “Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot” or other services, according to Wedbush’s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft’s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini. Microsoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this “might be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.” On Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools. Even if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp. Bank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the “best positioned” for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook. “While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,” she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. “Strong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.” Revenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. The question is whether that’s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25. “AI adoption is the question on everyone’s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “Some traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.” Tech Chart of the Day Apple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: UnitedHealth Stock Ails as Results Fall Short

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked lower on Thursday, failing to gain ground a day after soft inflation data and an upbeat start to earnings season helped drive a strong rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, ending a streak of three straight positive trading sessions. The Dow was also down 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares dropped 6.0%, posting the heaviest daily loss in the S&P 500, following the healthcare giant's first earnings release since last month's fatal shooting of insurance unit chief Brian Thompson. Although quarterly profits came in ahead of expectations, UnitedHealth reported lower-than-expected revenue. An increase in medical costs also contributed to a year-over-year uptick in the firm's medical cost ratio, which compares medical expenses to total revenue. Shares of US Bancorp (USB) plunged 5.6%. The move lower came after the financial services firm reported mixed quarterly results, topping adjusted profit estimates but falling short of forecasts for its net interest margin, a key measure of a bank's effectiveness in lending its capital. Texas Instruments (TXN) shares sank 5.1% after reports that China's Commerce Ministry is launching an investigation into the legality of U.S. subsidies for chipmakers that create competitive challenges for Chinese products. With a focus on lower-end semiconductors like power and analog chips, Texas Instruments could face repercussions if Chinese officials determine the company has violated anti-dumping regulations. Shares of Dexcom (DXCM), a manufacturer of glucose-monitoring devices for patients with diabetes, gained the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday, jumping 5.5%. Analysts at Piper Sandler highlighted several bullish catalysts for Dexcom, including a stable outlook for its durable medical equipment (DME) channel and the approval of reimbursement for 5 million patients with type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. In addition, Baird analysts boosted their price target on Dexcom stock, noting improvements in salesforce productivity and growth potential in U.S. markets. JPMorgan boosted its price target on Estee Lauder (EL) stock, and shares of the makeup and skin-care specialist jumped 4.8%. Analysts said they expect this earnings season to be consequential for makers of household and personal-care products, with discussions about consumer behaviors, tariff risks, currency impacts, and interest-rate expectations likely to influence the 2025 industry outlook. Semiconductor equipment stocks advanced after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), issued strong fourth-quarter profit guidance. The world's largest contract chipmaker highlighted an upbeat outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, which bodes well for sales of chip manufacturing gear, even as the Netherlands announced tightened export rules that could affect the industry. Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp. (KLAC), and Lam Research (LRCX) shares gained 4.5%, 4.3%, and 4.0%, respectively.

The core retail business, which Amazon also refers to as its stores division, encompasses a wide range of divisions, including its private label brands, Prime membership program, and consumables business. "We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition." The layoffs included employees in the fashion and fitness business, among others, the spokesperson said. Business Insider earlier reported on the job cuts. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has moved to rein in costs across the company, laying off about 27,000 employees since the beginning of 2022. The bulk of the job cuts came in 2022 and 2023, though they have been ongoing at a smaller scale, and have impacted almost every business across the company's portfolio. Amazon has also shuttered some of its more experimental and unprofitable initiatives, including its telehealth offering, a brick-and-mortar delivery program, and try-on service for clothing and shoes.

Title: 'Deeply Alarmed': Read the Letter WaPo Employees Sent to Jeff Bezos Demanding He Address Newsroom
URL: https://freebeacon.com/media/deeply-alarmed-read-the-letter-wapo-employees-sent-to-jeff-bezos-demanding-he-address-newsroom/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T20:00:59Z
Full Content:
The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, congressional bureau chief, and lead fact-checker were among the signatories of a letter to owner Jeff Bezos complaining about the paper’s current leadership and pressing him to come to the newsroom for a sit-down with newsroom leaders, according to a copy of the document obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The letter—a broadside against the paper’s leadership under publisher Will Lewis, whose push for political moderation has rankled many of the Post’s left-leaning employees—was first reported by NPR on Wednesday. But the names of the staffers who signed it have not previously been reported. Among the 432 signatories are White House Bureau Chief Toluse Olorunnipa, Congressional Bureau Chief Paul Kane, Senior Politics and Democracy Editor Griff Witte, and fact-checking columnist Glenn Kessler. Other prominent names include left-leaning columnists David Ignatius, Ruth Marcus, Karen Attiah, and Dana Milbank. The letter was also signed by the Post’s chief political correspondent Dan Balz, MAGA correspondent Isaac Arnsdorf, and White House reporter Yasmeen Abutaleb. The Post’s abortion correspondent Caroline Kitchener, Upper Midwest Democracy reporter Patrick Marley, and Climate Zeitgeist reporter Shannon Osaka signed the petition as well. The list of signers shows the growing discontent at the Post, which lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after declining to endorse Kamala Harris in November. The paper also drew criticism from employees this month after scrapping a cartoon that took aim at owner Bezos. The petition—sent to Bezos on Tuesday—was circulated around the newsroom this week for signatures, along with an addendum note that said it was written by a "small, cross-desk group of reporters with input from across the newsroom," according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon. The addendum urged employees to "sign this document immediately (even if you have already unofficially offered your support)" and added: "Please do not share this link or this letter with anyone outside The Post." In the letter to Bezos, employees said they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent," according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon. Staffers said their concerns go "far beyond the issue of the presidential endorsement, which we recognize as the owner’s prerogative." The letter urged Bezos to "come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at The Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in." A number of staffers have recently left the paper, including anti-Trump opinion writer Jen Rubin, while employees are reportedly bracing for a major round of layoffs. The Post has faced internal turmoil for months, with many staffers blaming Bezos and Lewis for the paper’s shift away from anti-Trump political activism. In October, the Free Beacon obtained audio from a tense meeting of the Post’s editorial team, where some of the writers bemoaned the paper’s decision to not publish a presidential endorsement and accused Bezos of political meddling and financial conflicts of interest. Just two days after the letter went to Bezos, on Thursday, the New York Times reported on a "new mission statement" at the Post meant to reflect "a more expansive view of The Post's journalism": "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The Post, however, will not be ditching its more infamous slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness." The letter sent to Bezos and its signatories can be read in full below: Letter to Jeff Bezos Dear colleagues: We have drafted a letter to our owner, and we are seeking your support. The following letter was written by a small, cross-desk group of reporters with input from across the newsroom. This is a collective action of employees and managers, both Guild-covered and not. So far, more than 420 of you have signed your names. We sent this letter directly to Jeff Bezos on Tuesday evening but will continue to collect signatures and add names to this form. We urge you to sign this document immediately (even if you have already unofficially offered your support). Please do not share this link or this letter with anyone outside The Post. Note that small changes have been made from earlier versions. Let's fight for the paper we love. *** To Jeff Bezos: You recently wrote that ensuring the long-term success and editorial independence of this newspaper is essential. We agree, and we believe you take as much pride in The Washington Post as we do. We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent. This goes far beyond the issue of the presidential endorsement, which we recognize as the owner’s prerogative. This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and reestablishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication. We urge you to come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at The Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in. We are committed to pursuing independent journalism that holds power to account and to reporting the news without fear or favor. That will never change. Nothing will shake our determination to follow the reporting wherever it leads. As you wrote when you first became The Post’s owner in 2013, "The values of The Post do not need changing." We urge you to stand with us in reaffirming those values.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is advancing 5% after the huge, Taiwan-based chip manufacturer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results today. A Look at TSM's Q4 Results and Statements The company's Q4 sales jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.88 billion. That was $890 million above analysts' average estimate. Further, TSM's earnings per share rose to $2.24, compared with $1.44 in Q4 of 2023. Analysts, on average, had expected the firm's Q4 EPS to come in at $2.23. "With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and" high-performance computing (HPC)," CFO Wendell Huang asserted on the company's Q4 earnings call. HPC accounted for 53% of its Q4 revenue, versus 43% in Q4 of 2023. For Q1, the chip maker provided revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected the company's sales to come in at $24.75 billion. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Huang said in a statement. The Price Action of TSM Stock In the last month, the shares have advanced 11.5%, while they are up 5.5% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 400+ Journalists at “Washington Post” Sign Petition to Bezos

For decades, The Washington Post has been one of the nation’s premier newspapers, widely admired for its fearless journalism. During the McCarthy era in the 1950s, The Post held the reckless Senator from Wisconsin to account. It took the lead in exposing Watergate. A job at The Washington Post was a prize for any journalist. Jeff Bezos bought the paper in 2013. It was widely assumed that he had “saved” the paper from its financial woes because of his wealth and that he would not interfere with its editorial independence. But recently, Bezos’ stance changed. He hired Will Lewis, an editor from the despicable Murdoch empire, to turn the paper around financially. The paper has experienced layoffs and censorship. When Bezos’ spiked the editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall, more than 300,000 subscribers canceled. When an editorial cartoon lampooning billionaires (including Bezos) courting Trump was killed, the cartoonist quit. The morale of the staff hit rock-bottom. David Folkenflik of NPR reported on the rebellion among the journalists: One debacle after another has engulfed The Washington Post since veteran newspaper executive Will Lewis became CEO and publisher a year ago this month, with the charge from owner Jeff Bezos to make the storied newspaper financially sustainable. The appointment of a new executive editor was botched. A killed presidential endorsement led hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel. Top reporters and editors left. Scandals involving Lewis’ actions as a news executive years ago in the U.K. reemerged. A clear vision to secure the Post’s financial future remains elusive. Frustration boiled over on Tuesday night. More than 400 Post journalists, including some editors, signed a petition asking Bezos to intervene. “We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave,” it reads, in part. The petition never cites Lewis by name, but it reads as a sharp indictment of his leadership. Through a spokesperson, Lewis and the Post declined comment for this story. A representative of Bezos did not return a request for comment. For this story, NPR interviewed 10 Washington Post staffers inside the newsroom and on the business side of the paper, including some who did not sign the petition. They agreed to speak to NPR under condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions inside the paper. They say the backlash against Lewis encompasses Bezos to some degree, as he has publicly warmed up to President-elect Donald Trump. (The Post declined comment.) Bezos’ decision to kill a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election led more than 300,000 subscribers to cancel, wiping out much more modest gains The Post had achieved under Lewis. (A spokesperson says The Post has convinced about 20% of those cancelling over the endorsement to remain subscribers.) The decision also led to some resignations. Recent days at the Post have witnessed the continuation of a months-long parade of departures of highly regarded newsroom veterans — most recently, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Rosalind Helderman, investigative reporter Josh Dawsey and columnist Jennifer Rubin. Pulitzer-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit after her sketch showing Bezos kneeling before Trump with a bag of money was rejected. The tech titan’s business interests, including Amazon Web Services and the space company Blue Origin, receive billions of dollars from federal contracts. He’s given $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration costs and traveled to Mar-a-Lago with his fiancée to meet with the president-elect. Amazon Studios agreed to pay Melania Trump millions of dollars for a documentary project about her, according to Puck News. Come Monday, Bezos is expected to join Trump advisor Elon Musk and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on the inauguration platform itself. The petition asked for a meeting with Bezos. Open the link to continue reading this important article. I think there should be a mass resignation from WaPo at this point. Band together and create a competing startup. I think fundraising and subscriptions would be very popular. I would sign up. LikeLike Daniel, It’s harder and more costly than you think to start a new newspaper. All of the 400+ who signed the petition have mortgages to pay, household expenses, etc. At this point, some other billionaire would have to buy the paper from Bezos. Someone who understands the idea of editorial independence and freedom of the press. LikeLiked by 1 person His ex-wife perhaps. LikeLike It sounds like neither Lewis nor Bezos, like Trump, know the difference between what Fox/Murdoch does and what the Washington Post has been about for a long time. In my view, if true, then these are morally defunct people, to say the least. If anyone hasn’t seen the movie “The Post,” with Tom Hanks and Merle Streep, it chronicles the crucial run up to the Nixon resignation inspired by that same WAPO and focuses on how difficult it was to stay on their principled track, . . . but they did. But for Lewis and Bezos, not to mention Murdoch, it’s probably “huh”? CBK LikeLike Friendly correction: Bezos bought WaPo in 2013, not 2023. LikeLike Thank you, Jack. I thought I typed 2013. But I didn’t. I do all my blogging on a cell phone and it’s easy to hit the wrong key because they are tiny.

Title: Microsoft Is Riding The Wave To Long-Term Growth Through AI And Cloud

By Nabeel Bukhari Summary Microsoft Corporation (MSFT, Financial) is a brand familiar to many, with its system integration being a part of life for millions of people globally. However, in an unusual irony, the stock has not risen to the extent expected, given the phenomenal growth of the technology industry in recent years. Nevertheless, Microsoft is still a giant and one of the biggest winners in the generative AI race. Its partnership with OpenAI is not only helpful to Azure's revenue growth but also bestows the company with a powerful role in the field of AI driven innovation. While Microsoft is not screaming value at present, its ability to generate robust double-digit growth with unmatched cash flow generation is almost impossible to ignore. While I've been pulling back on some of my biggest growth winners, Microsoft remains a standout stock with great long-term potential and with the ability to provide great returns. Microsoft's Q1 2025 earnings report shows the company is fully charged, with healthy growth rates coupled with progressive investments. Microsoft Revenue and Net Income Chart Total revenues of the company were up 16% year-over-year (YOY) to $65.6 billion, accelerating from the preceding quarter's growth rate of 15.2% and the 12.8% rate in the same period last year. Earnings per share were not far behind, rising at a 10% rate to $3.30 in part due to smart investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the dilution from Activision Blizzard. Both factors, though modestly impacting the near-term profits, are in fact strategic actions taken for the purpose of securing the company's long-term control. Let's break down the Microsoft's key segments to better understand what drives this growth and where might the company be going next. The essence of Microsoft is in its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is still the biggest source of both revenues and profits for the company at the time being. This segment generated a revenue of $28.3 billion which was up 12% and was ahead of the company's guidance of 10% primarily driven by strong uptake of enterprise products such as Microsoft 365 Copilot that incorporate AI. Management guidance of up to 11% growth next quarter supports the view that businesses will sustain efficiency through advanced AI capabilities. Yet, all the focus is on Azure, the crown jewel in the Intelligent Cloud segment (up 20% and generated a revenue of $24.1 billion) for Microsoft. Azure itself is up a monstrous 33%. Such acceleration proves the company's strength and its close connection with OpenAI which not only improves Azure but also brings in new clients eager for the best AI solutions. While management has forecasted up to a mind-boggling 32% growth next quarter, this is expected to increase in the second half of the year as more AI capacities come online. Azure's growth path may outpace the Productivity segment to become the new cash cow for Microsoft. Last but not least, the More Personal Computing segment's revenue of $13.2 billion, up 17%, is still more cyclical than the rest of the segments. Management anticipates that revenues in this segment will be slightly lower compared to the prior year due to lapping tougher comparables. However, the inclusion of Activision Blizzard as part of this segment points to long-run growth. The acquisition had a dilutive impact of $440 million on operating income this quarter, but synergies and cost discipline should help flip it into a growth driver. Furthermore, Microsoft is a fortress, with $116.2 billion in cash at the end of the quarter against $45 billion in debt. Microsoft Cash and Debt Chart As we look at the graph above, it's evident that the buffer has shrunk significantly compared to previous years. Well, that's due to increased capital expenditures to heavy investments. In 2023, the ratio dropped below 1.5 but the good news is that it has since recovered, back up to 1.28. This dip doesn't take away from the fact that Microsoft is in a great financial position and is well set up for a steady growth trajectory as its AI-driven investments mature. As of recent prices, MSFT found itself trading at around 33x earnings. Consensus estimates depict the stock to clock higher double-digit growth rates in the years to come. I consider these estimates reasonable based on the stellar momentum of Azure. The stock may not even appear as an obvious bargain at around 12x sales, as this multiple ranks highly compared to other software companies. However, I would like to stress that some premium is deserved given that MSFT is already earning such high profit margins, and, therefore, its high earnings yield would contribute to the continuous return prospects. In the longer term, I still expect net margins under GAAP to reach towards 45%-50% as operating leverage starts to kick in, up from 37.7% in the latest quarter. This actually put the current valuation at 25x long-term earnings, which could be considered reasonable with the strong balance sheet and long-term secular growth. Between the consensus estimate of double-digit revenue growth and the roughly 3% earnings yield, I think this stock can deliver between 15% to 17% annual compounded returns for the next five years or more. To get a return less than that projected by the above formula, either the company has to underperform the consensus growth estimates or the stock's valuation would need to compress. Even if we assume that the stock is trading at 21x long-term earnings in five years, the stock will return between 12% to 14% per year and will therefore outperform the average 8% return of the market. MSFT does trade at a slight premium to its 5-year average but is still not as greatly overvalued as one might think given the current tech euphoria and the company's position in it. Over the last five years, Microsoft's stock skyrocketed 160.58% as showed in the graph below, which demonstrates that the company has good opportunities in fast growth sectors like cloud computing, AI and enterprise software. But this performance also speaks about a market that is willing to pay a premium for steady and consistent growth. Microsoft Price Chart Currently, the stock's valuation multiples which I discussed previously are both considerably higher than Microsoft's historical ratios and its sector ‘s median. For the past year, Microsoft posted a 12.40% return, but this does not compare to the kind of growth witnessed previously due to market fluctuations. The stock rose to $450 in mid-2024 but has since corrected to trade in the $410-$425 range. This correction may have come from valuation concerns and other market factors rather than company-specific issues. However, it is important to note that the $400 level is the critical support zone as investors consider any price dip close to this range to be a good buying opportunity. Nonetheless, the current trading price of the stock reflects that the investors lack the enthusiasm to drive the valuations even higher. The $468.35 as a 52-week high is a significant resistance point while $450 has acted as the ceiling over the past year. Penetrating this barrier would require Microsoft to post stellar earnings or for the market sentiment to change. On the other hand, missing the high expectations may lead the stock to retest the $400 support level. In the short term, Microsoft shares are unlikely to move much beyond the $400-$450 range as the investors assess its valuation relative to growth potential. The longer-term stable scenario of maintaining double-digit top-line growth rates, along with GAAP net margin growth towards 45%, can justify further price increases. Investors should be careful of market risk and ensure that the stock's valuation is correct with regard to their investment horizon and risk tolerance. Microsoft fundamentals are good, however, short-term gains are expected to be dependent on its ability to beat high forecasts. The prospects appear favorable for Microsoft, however, there are some risks that may affect the thesis I've described above. First, lower-than-expected AI adoption is a big concern. The growth story heavily draws on Azure performance, depending on AI-powered tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot. However, delays in the adoption of these tools or issues related to the implementation of the same can slow down the overall AI and Cloud service revenues as anticipated. This might also slow down the total growth of the company. Another significant risk is the competitiveness threat that Microsoft experiences most in the cloud as well as the AI segments. Azure has been a good performer but in front of Microsoft are giant competitors like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud both of whom are actively using similar technologies. If these competitors advance further or if Azure's expansion is thrown off by more competition, then the rate of revenue expansion, which is core to the thesis could be impacted. Last but not least, regulatory challenges can not be ignored. Microsoft is under increasing pressure from regulators, notably due to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. If regulatory bodies enter or place restrictions on the company, there might be unhealthy hindrances or complicities in the company's expansion strategies. New regulations for Big Tech may also become a problem, which, together with existing problems, can cause additional risks to the company's future. These risks are noteworthy, considering they can influence both growth and valuation assumptions. All in all, Microsoft remains a great stock for the long-term investment. This is being achieved under the stewardship of Azure, which is driving impressive growth and with the company now placing more emphasis on AI, gives the impression that it is poised to benefit from some of the most promising trends in technology. Sure the stock is a little bit on the expensive side, but when you look at the cash flow, healthy margins and growth possibility that is being offered, the premium that is commanded for the stock seems well deserved. Of course, there are a few risks, but Microsoft has proved its abilities to overcome obstacles and to remain ahead of innovations. So as long as it keeps delivering in the AI and cloud sectors as it has done before, I believe the stock will keep on giving good returns. I would recommend Microsoft to anyone seeking solid, market-beating growth in tech, as the company possesses healthy financials and leads in high-growth areas. It's a stock you can hold onto and expect it to pay off in many years to come. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta's 'non-regrettable attrition' and the other corporate lingo used to downplay job cuts

Time Published: 2025-01-16T15:32:52Z

Allow for a quick riff on RIFs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. Whether it's a "reduction in force," "rightsizing," or "streamlining," the fancy language doesn't soften the blow for workers — or hide the reality of lost jobs. One recent example: Meta said this week it would push out an additional 5% of what Mark Zuckerberg called "low-performers." Clear enough. Yet in a subsequent memo from Hillary Champion, Meta's director of people development growth programs, the focus became "non-regrettable attrition." At Amazon, a phrase often used for such cuts is "unregretted attrition." It's the type of language that can draw snark online. Following Meta's announcement, one person wrote on X: "'Non-regrettable attrition' lmao.'" A Meta spokesperson declined to comment beyond saying the company plans to fill the vacated positions in 2025. Steve McClatchy, who consults on leadership and is the author of the book "Leading Relationships," told BI that public companies often use euphemistic language around job cuts to try to avoid spooking investors and raising concerns that the business is in trouble. But, he said, that effort often falls flat when they use terms like nonregrettable attrition. "How sad is that language? It's trying to say to the ownership group, we're headed in the right direction, not the wrong one," McClatchy said. There are numerous other ways to frame offboarding, err, cutbacks, err, workforce adjustments, and the need to do so. For example, the news site TechCrunch told BI on Tuesday it's reducing staff because of "evolving needs." It's possible that for many employers, workforce optimization, organizational realignment, and — shout out to ChatGPT for this one — internal mobility challenges just sound better than job cuts. Yet, workplace experts told BI, the fallout is the same. "We're seeing a lot of companies now do everything not to use the actual word layoff, even though that's exactly what they're doing," Peter Rahbar, an employment attorney who founded the boutique law firm the Rahbar Group, told BI. A spokesperson for the food giant Cargill previously told BI that job cuts were designed to "realign our talent and resources to align with our strategy." Last year, Bumble said it would cut about 30% of its workforce "to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities." Cutting jobs is often bad for morale and can hurt productivity when workers become consumed with worrying they're next. That can be true even with a case like that of Meta, which said it planned to "backfill" roles in 2025. Translation: hire better people — though not you. Yet, McClatchy said, to imply that a worker who gets pushed out for poor performance is solely at fault misses the responsibility that employers have to make good hires and that managers have to help those under their tutelage perform their best. "It's 100% an attack on the employee that has to go then find a job. And what a shame that is," he said. Sandra Sucher, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School who has studied layoffs, told BI that most terms for layoffs are designed to make an otherwise negative act appear more positive. She said companies often use the term regrettable attrition for good workers they're sorry to see leave. So a term like nonregrettable attrition is a way of "sugarcoating" the fact that an employer is letting people go. Connecting it to attrition is meant, Sucher said, to imply that employers have a handle on the outflow. Yet, she said, attrition isn't always something companies can control. "The point of attrition is that you're not managing it. It's something that, by and large, happens to you," she said. Rahbar, the attorney, said employers' choice of wording when it comes to culling workers isn't about protecting themselves legally. Instead, he said, it's mostly a public-relations dance and, ultimately, one that does little good. "If you're an employee who is impacted by this, the language they're using to describe it is irrelevant. It's not going to soften the blow," Rahbar said. Ravin Jesuthasan, a coauthor of the book "The Skills-Powered Organization" and the global leader for transformation services at the consulting firm Mercer, told BI that employers have been cutting jobs for more than a century when business falters. "I don't know why there was a need to introduce new language," he said. In some cases, the words aren't new; they're just redeployed, reassigned, or transitioned to a new role. In Champion's memo at Meta, she wrote that the company was "aiming to exit" an additional 5% of its workers who'd been around long enough to get a performance rating. "'Exit' as in GTFO!" one X user posted. Not all euphemisms might be as likely to whip up worker cynicism, of course. The practice of scoring workers based on various metrics and getting rid of the worst performers sometimes goes by the human-resources shorthand "rank and yank." Corporatespeak can also be a handy way to add levity in uncertain times. One social media user wrote on X about what might happen when artificial intelligence shows up to make cutbacks, oblique language in tow. "Humans will become 'Non-Regrettable Attrition' for AI," the person wrote. Do you have something to share about job cuts or something else at work? Business Insider would like to hear from you.

Title: TSMC stock rises more than 5% after record net profit driven by AI chip demand
URL: https://qz.com/tsmc-taiwan-ai-chip-demand-stock-q4-quarter-earnings-1851740939
Time Published: 2025-01-16T15:30:00Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-1.37%) U.S.-listed shares rose by more than 6% at the market open on Thursday morning. The chipmaker’s stock was up by more than 5% during pre-market trading after its fourth-quarter earnings results beat expectations. Later in the morning, TSMC’s shares were up by around 5.6%. The company reported net revenue of NT$868.46 billion, or $26.36 billion, and record net income of NT$374.68 billion, or about $11.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31. TSMC said its fourth quarter revenue increased 38.8% year over year, while net income rose 57% from the previous year to a record high. “Our business in the fourth quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Shipments of advanced 3-nanometer chips made up 26% of total wafer revenue, TSMC said, while advanced 5-nanometer chips accounted for 34%, and 7-nanometer chips were 14% of the total. On a post-earnings call with analysts, TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said the company “observed robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout 2024.” Revenue from TSMC’s AI accelerators “accounted for close to mid-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024,” Wei said. The Taiwanese chipmaker set revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2025 at between $25 billion and $25.8 billion — higher than a consensus by analysts of $24.4 billion, according to a Jefferies (JEF+1.71%) note. Wei said TSMC’s first fab in Arizona entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter using the 4-nanometer process, and reached a yield comparable to its facilities in Taiwan. The chipmaker expects “a smooth ramp-up process,” Wei said, and is confident in having “the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as for our fab in Taiwan.” TSMC is also on track with its second and third Arizona fabs, Wei said. Earlier this week, the Biden administration introduced new rules encouraging chip producers such as TSMC to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence in an effort to prevent advanced chips from getting to Chinese customers.

Title: The Best Foods to Buy in Bulk, According to a Meal Planning Pro

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Bulk groceries cost significantly less. Here are six staples you can stockpile for the next several months. We asked an expert about the best foods to buy in bulk. The price of groceries still remains a hot topic. According to a recent CNET survey, it's still the No. 1 source of sticker shock for Americans, myself included. We've covered numerous ways to save a little money in your grocery budget: food saving apps such as Flashfood; the difference in cost between name brand and store brand groceries; and whether shopping at Trader Joe's results in meaningful savings over other grocery chains. And, of course, there's buying in bulk. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's what an expert told me about food expiration dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $7.99, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $12.99 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $22.99, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Thursday, with the major indexes struggling to build on the previous day's surge amid another round of big bank earnings. Investors also watched as the Senate hearing kicked off for President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.1%. Markets are coming off a major one-day rally on the heels of a surprise easing in consumer inflation that prompted questions about whether the pricing out of interest-rate cuts this year had gone too far. Stocks ripped higher on Wednesday on the back of the data and stellar earnings from major US lenders. Traders have now ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve lowers rates before July, reversing the pile-out that was sparked by the stronger-than-expected December jobs report. Retail sales for December grew by 0.4%, versus expectations of 0.6%. The monthly gain slowed from November’s 0.7% increase. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to 217,000, versus the prior week's upwardly revised 203,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) results showed fourth quarter profit more than doubled as the bank benefitted from a Wall Street dealmaking revival that has also boosted earnings at its rivals. Its shares were up slightly in early trading. Morgan Stanley's (MS) stock also rose after it posted a surge in quarterly profit before the bell. Elsewhere in earnings, UnitedHealth's (UNH) fourth quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dented by weakness in its health insurance unit. The stock slid in early trading. Also taking focus Thursday was the Senate Finance Committee hearing on Bessent's confirmation. Topics investors were watching to surface during the gathering include tariff policies and debt concerns amid Republican initiatives for 2025 tax and spending plans. Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury Secretary highlighted an opportunity for a new 'Golden Age' for the US during opening remarks at his confirmation hearing. "Today, I believe that President Trump has a generational opportunity to unleash a new economic Golden Age that will create more jobs, wealth, and prosperity for all Americans," Bessent told lawmakers on Thursday morning. The nominee highlighted his life's work in the private sector has given him a understanding of the economy and markets. "Having never served in government, I intend if confirmed, to be in close contact with each of you and your offices, and seek your council," said Bessent. He also highlighted the need for the government to ensure the US Dollar remains the world's reserve currency. Lawmakers were making opening remarks on Thursday morning at the confirmation hearing for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary Scott Bessent. The hearing is likely to last about two and a half hours. Likely topics Bessent will face questions on include policies surrounding tariffs, and Republican initiatives for 2025 tax initiatives and spending plans. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, will face questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill today starting at 10:30 a.m ET. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports on two issues to watch for during the hearing which have come into focus this week. One is around a swirl of seemingly competing tariff plans before President-elect Donald Trump, some of which Bessent himself is reportedly pushing. A second is whether Republicans will be able to ignore debt concerns and go big with their 2025 tax and spending plans. Read more here. Builders are starting the year with more optimism than in the end of 2024, despite elevated mortgage rates. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose to 47 in January, up one point from December and higher than economists’ estimates of 45, per Bloomberg data. Still, a reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. The dilemma of high housing costs persists, with mortgage rates hovering closer to 7% over the past four consecutive weeks, according to Freddie Mac. Markets expect the Fed will likely leave rates unchanged this month, especially after fresh inflation data released Wednesday showed some signs of easing. The Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates but its actions influence the direction of yields, which in turn affect borrowing costs. The NAHB survey showed builders continue to offer concessions in January. The survey found that 60% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, while 30% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in January. The average price reduction was 5%, matching December’s price cut. US stocks were mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best daily performance since November and strong quarterly bank earnings. The broad based index rose more than 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. Investors were watching for a continuation of Thursday's performance when stocks ripped higher on the heels of better than expected inflation data and strong quarterly bank earnings. Traders have been assessing how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve will implement this year following a better than expected jobs report last Friday but a cooling inflation print on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note they "now forecast two 25bp cuts this year in June and December (vs. three cuts previously in March, June, and September) followed by another cut in June 2026." Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Retail sales grew at a slower pace than Wall Street had expected in December as investors keep a close eye on the pace of economic growth amid questions over how quickly the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Retail sales rose 0.4% in December. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in November were revised up to 0.8% from a prior reading that showed a 0.7% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Read more here. Good chart by the Vanda Research team looking at Mag 7 flows from the retail trading community. You can see activity having slowed down in January with names like Nvidia under pressure. Dare I say it's refreshing to see traders nibble at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500!

Not sure why Target didn't blow me away! Sales barely grew and the company reiterated its EPS outlook — an outlook that at the top end is 20 cents below current sell-side consensus. Bottom line: this is yet another quarter from Target that sheds light on its continued market share loss to Walmart (WMT). Here's what Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told me when accepting our 2024 Company of the Year award. PS: I like Walmart's new blue logo color that ties back to founder Sam Walton's iconic trucker hat.

Title: How blowout bank earnings and a promising inflation report gave the market a much-needed boost
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-stocks-recover-after-bank-earnings-inflation-data-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-16T14:14:52Z

Hello there! A product going viral can be a double-edged sword for retailers. Just ask Walmart. The big-box store's e-commerce marketplace got a boost from an imitation Hermès' Birkin bag making the rounds, but dupes also cause headaches for brand relationships. In today's big story, US banks' impressive earnings and a hopeful inflation report have stocks back on the rise. What's on deck Markets: Anthony Scaramucci offers some economic predictions for Trump's second term. Tech: The VC world is starting to heal as Insight Partners raises a massive new fund. Business: Billionaires are booked and busy next week thanks to a scheduling conflict between the inauguration and Davos. But first, we're so back. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's alive! After a slow start to the year, the stock market finally showed signs of life thanks to blowout bank earnings and better-than-expected inflation data. The S&P 500 finished Wednesday up 1.83%, while the Dow (1.65%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite (2.45%) posted strong days. Let's start with Wall Street. Big US banks represent the unofficial kickoff to earnings season, and they didn't disappoint. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all beat analysts expectations. JPMorgan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in profits for the fourth quarter while Goldman's profits jumped an incredible 105%. The banking boom was largely driven by classic Wall Street businesses like corporate dealmaking, capital raising, and trading. December's inflation report also put extra wind in the market's sails. At first glance — inflation rose for the third straight month — the reading might not seem great. But a closer look showed the consumer price index's year-over-year increase matched consensus expectations, which is good. What's even better, though, is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was slightly below expectations. It also came in lower than November's number. Before you get ahead of yourself, don't expect a slew of rate cuts. Instead, the data calmed investors' nerves by slowing the troubling rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped 0.14%. "Core Inflation isn't accelerating and that's the story. The market may have had its hair on fire about inflation running away again, but the data do not support that conclusion," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group. So what's next for Wall Street? In the short term, bankers might finally enjoy some healthy bonuses after a few slim years. Workers are starting to find out about their year-end comp. Bigger picture, it's more momentum for the industry's job market. After a lull in activity, firms are bolstering their ranks across the board for what appears to be an active 2025. The private markets are one area that'll remain in the spotlight. The sector, which includes less-liquid investments like private equity and private credit that come with higher fees, is of particular interest to BlackRock. The $11.6 trillion asset manager sees it as the key to its next stage of evolution, according to CEO Larry Fink. One evolution Fink didn't discuss was who will take over when he's gone. That's despite the recent departure of executive Mark Wiedman, which reignited questions about what life after Larry will look like at BlackRock. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was a little bit more forthcoming with his own retirement plans … sort of. When asked by an analyst who his successor was, Dimon said there are a number of great candidates, but a decision hasn't been made. And even if the bank did have someone in mind, there's no guarantee things won't change, Dimon added. 1. One of Trump's opps is feeling good about the economy. Despite being a longtime Trump critic, Anthony Scaramucci is pretty optimistic about the economy under the incoming 47th president. He sees Trump's pro-growth policies and potential crypto legislation as an economic boon — but he's still concerned about some of Trump's other promises. 2. Hindenburg Research is tapping out. Nate Anderson, founder of the short-selling firm, said he's disbanding it, once they've completed all outstanding projects. Hindenburg gained fame for its forensic financial research, often focusing on what it argued to be fraudulent or misleading corporate behavior. Anderson said he plans to share the firm's investigation tactics publicly. 3. Dividend stocks are so back. Large-cap stocks have dominated the market, but a change could be coming, according to Morningstar. As their valuations continue to climb, dividend stocks might become more palatable. Morningstar highlighted dividend stocks in four specific sectors savvy investors should pay attention to. 1. Mark Zuckerberg lost $60 billion in five years — and he's going to keep spending. Despite persistent predictions that the VR and AR headset market will boom, consumers just aren't interested. Meta lost big on the tech in the last few years, but that hasn't deterred Zuck, who keeps telling investors they should expect more losses in the future. 2. Exclusive: Insight Partners raises $12.5 billion for its newest set of funds. It's the largest sum raised by a venture capital firm in over two years, according to PitchBook data. Insight's $12.5 billion may be less than its initial funding goal, but it's still an impressive get as the industry looks to mount a comeback. 3. "TikTok refugees" flock to Chinese app RedNote. While some Americans are coping with a possible TikTok ban through memes, competitors like Texas-based app Clapper are seizing the moment. Other Americans are heading to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. It might be worth learning how to use it — but some members of Congress are already taking aim. 1. WFH + Fridays = OOO. For some remote workers, the W in WFH Friday is a bit of a stretch. They're turning every weekend into a three-day weekend, and they don't feel particularly bad about it, either. 2. Home Depot cofounders were investigated by the FBI in the '70s and '80s, new public records show. The FBI was investigating Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank over claims they used a slush fund in an attempt to bribe California Handy Dan employees to decertify their union, newly obtained records show. The investigation ended in 1983 when a prosecutor determined the case was too old and evidence was "insufficient." 3. Double-booked billionaires. January 20 is not only Trump's inauguration but also the first day of the World Economic Forum's high-profile conference in Davos, Switzerland. Conflicted guests will have to choose between missing potential face time with the new president or a day of brushing shoulders with the global elite. Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi won't be missing out on Trump's big day. Boeing's dismal 2024 deliveries show just how much of a challenge CEO Kelly Ortberg faces. UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley report earnings.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Quantum computing stocks pushed on with their run in premarket trading Thursday after gaining steam Wednesday. The good news comes as industry leaders highlight quantum computing advancements and potential growth prospects in the sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT, Financial) shares jumped 15.5%, while Rigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI, Financial) advanced 3.4%, D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS, Financial) gaining 9.6% and IonQ Inc. (IONQ, Financial) rising 1.9%. It reflects a growing interest by investors, spurred by the growing corporate commitment to quantum technologies. However, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, Financial) has been the sector's biggest cheerleader. In the case of Mitra Azizirad, COO of Microsoft's strategic missions and technology division: from 2020, talk will be of businesses moving to become the familiar 'quantum-ready' by 2025. This push is backed up by Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financial), which announced that it will host a Quantum Day' at its upcoming GTC conference and is committing to integrate quantum computing within classical systems. Despite some industry sceptics like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who estimates practical quantum computing is still a couple of decades away, companies are proactively creating the work environments that will make it happen. Microsoft has programs for businesses to help tackle this technological evolution, and Nvidia is now recruiting for roles in quantum research. Since Google broke onto the quantum scene with its Willow quantum chip, the quantum sector has also come under the microscope. Companies in this developing quantum era are positioning themselves for long-term growth and are being watched closely by investors and analysts alike. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: Forbes Daily: Biden Takes Aim At Big Tech In Final Days As President

Plus: The use of AI kissing apps and their promotion on social media including Meta and TikTok have some experts concerned about the lack of consent involved and the continued rise of deepfakes. Good morning, Corporate training videos can be dull. But one British startup is betting it can use AI to change that. Synthesia’s AI avatars are already used by companies like Xerox, Spirit Airlines and chemicals giant DuPont to convert training text into videos in over 20 languages—with just one click. Synthesia just raised $180 million, valuing it at $2.1 billion, to make its avatars more lifelike and invest in tools for creating and hosting videos. Eventually, the company could compete with giants like OpenAI’s Sora or AI video startup Runway. But Synthesia’s lucrative niche making human proxies means its customers are more likely to be HR teams rather than Hollywood directors. President Joe Biden speaks about the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal as Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken look on. Israel and Gaza-based militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal Wednesday after more than 15 months of fighting and just days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. President Joe Biden said in a press conference that American hostages would be released as part of the first phase of the deal, but that all other details of the plan would be forthcoming. Officials believe 98 hostages remain in Gaza and that about 60 are still alive, per the Washington Post. If ByteDance were to sell TikTok to avoid an impending ban in the U.S. (which it has indicated it has no plans to do), how much would it be worth? Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner leading a group bidding for the social media giant, thinks TikTok’s U.S. business is worth $20 billion without its powerful “recommendation engine” which suggests new videos. But with the prized algorithm, one analyst thinks that a price of $300 billion “could be conservative.” MORE: Trump is considering ways to prevent TikTok’s potential ban, including a possible executive order, according to the Washington Post. Meanwhile, the social media company’s CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the president-elect’s inauguration next week, with the New York Times reporting that he was formally invited by the inaugural committee. Inflation is still not back to the pre-pandemic norm. Inflation reached its highest level since the summer in December, at 2.9% year-over-year, though it was in line with economists’ projections. The higher inflation reading was at least in part a reflection of price increases tied to the turn of the calendar year, according to two Goldman Sachs economists. But core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy price changes, was 3.2%, better than consensus estimates. MORE: Markets responded strongly to the report, the first inflation reading of the year, as the S&P 500 ended up 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.65% and the Nasdaq surged 2.45%, their best days since November 6. Still, one strategist warned the market’s recent fickle nature should keep investors on their toes. Payments startup Bolt’s $450 million raise is on ice after investors sued to block the round, but one Bolt shareholder has managed to escape the turmoil. Delaware’s Court of the Chancery ruled in a December 16 hearing that Bolt investor Activant Capital could sell $37 million of its shares back to the startup, ending a legal dispute that began in July 2023. The Blue Origin New Glenn rocket lifts off Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin successfully launched its New Glenn heavy lift rocket into orbit early Thursday—though it failed to meet a secondary goal of recovering a reusable booster stage of the rocket, which was lost during reentry. Still, the launch helps Blue Origin notch a key milestone as it aims to compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Three-year-old startup Saronic, which aims to make a fleet of autonomous boats for the U.S. Navy, is in talks to raise $500 million, Forbes has learned. The fundraising round would value the nascent company at over $3 billion, the latest signal of booming venture capital interest in defense tech. In his farewell address Wednesday night, President Joe Biden warned Americans about what he called an oligarchy “of extreme wealth, power and influence” taking root in the U.S. The president also took aim at Big Tech, saying that he was “concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex,” while calling for more safeguards on powerful AI technologies. President-elect Donald Trump hosted 22 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week. All these visitors, including dozens of other political powerbrokers, will likely boost Mar-a-Lago’s bottom line: Profits at the club have already more than doubled since the end of Trump’s first term. Drake sued Universal Music Group, which represents both himself and rapper Kendrick Lamar, accusing the major music company of defamation for releasing and promoting Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us.” Drake’s lawsuit claims that UMG—but not Lamar—falsely promoted the ideas that Drake has committed acts of pedophilia and sex trafficking, which the rapper denies. The delays at the heart of the lawsuit date back to 2022. The Transportation Department sued Southwest Airlines over “chronically delayed flights,” its latest action after fining JetBlue Airways over the same issue earlier this month. The lawsuit alleges Southwest flights from Chicago to Oakland and from Baltimore to Cleveland reached their destinations late nearly 200 times in 2022, according to CNBC. Brightline West, a bullet train project from billionaire investor Wes Eden to connect Las Vegas with suburban Los Angeles, is raising $2.5 billion from private investors with a tax-exempt bond offering. The new funding push, along with a $3 billion federal grant and other funds, is intended to help cover the estimated $12.4 billion needed to complete the line. Brightline seeks to launch passenger service by late 2028. As wildfires rage in Southern California, many are asking what they can do to help. Tax-exempt charities accepting wildfire-specific donations include the American Red Cross, the California Fire Foundation, the Los Angeles Food Bank and Direct Relief. Even if you’re not planning to claim a tax deduction, some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations—like checking to see that the organization you’re giving to has its paperwork in order—are good rules to follow. MORE: Those impacted by the fire may get some relief from the IRS and the tax code, for instance, by taking an early withdrawal from a workplace retirement savings account without the penalty. And individuals and businesses in a federally declared disaster area are entitled to claim casualty loss deductions. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; IMAGE BY BORIS SV/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE Meta and TikTok have run thousands of ads for apps that use AI to generate fake kissing videos of people, allowing users to upload photos of any two people and let AI convert them into a video of them kissing. The apps are being marketed as tools that would allow you to instantly “kiss anyone you want”—no consent required. Similar in concept to “AI nudifier” apps that produce nonconsensual deepfake pornography, these AI kissing apps create believable videos of people doing something they didn’t do. And the ease at which they do it is a concerning habitualization of deepfake imagery. While the ads are not sexually explicit like the deluge of AI-generated pornographic content that has engulfed social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit and YouTube, they can be equally dangerous, Haley McNamara, an executive at the National Center for Sexual Exploitation told Forbes. The companies behind these video generators appear to be based outside the U.S. in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Italy and China, according to their websites. The apps are available for free on Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store and already have millions of downloads. The spread of AI kissing apps, boosted by social media’s virality, illustrate a troubling mainstreaming of deepfakes in the age of generative AI. Use of these seemingly harmless apps could open the door to tools that could create more graphic imagery like deepfake porn and other types of image-based sexual abuse, McNamara said. “It’s just an absolute Pandora’s box,” she said. WHY IT MATTERS “The rise of an ‘AI kissing trend’ on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok represents the mainstreaming of deepfakes at a time when AI tools are being used to create nonconsensual pornographic deepfakes,” says Forbes reporter Rashi Shrivastava. “As is the case with AI image generators like Stable Diffusion, such systems can be misused to create videos of someone without their consent, and bully or harass them.” MORE Almost Half The Girls At This School Were Targets Of AI Porn. Their Ex-Classmates Have Now Been Indicted. Apple and Google have delisted apps developed by the Huione Group, a Cambodian company accused on Tuesday of running the biggest dark web market of all time: As much as $24 billion: The amount of sales that have gone through the Huione Guarantee platform, according to crypto crime tracker Elliptic $5 billion: The amount of sales on the next most lucrative illegal bazaar, Hydra ‘The largest illicit online marketplace to have ever operated’: Elliptic said of Huione’s Telegram-based platform Finally receiving a job offer after a lengthy search feels like a huge weight lifted, but the next step, salary negotiation, requires careful navigation. First, research industry-specific salary ranges, and consider other forms of compensation, like stock options, health benefits and bonus structures. Try to strike a balance between being assertive and diplomatic. If a company provides a lowball offer, counter with a well-researched figure that reflects your true worth. As a potential TikTok ban looms, some users are flocking to one of China’s most popular social media apps. Which app is it? A. WeChat B. Weibo C. RedNote D. Tencent QQ Check your answer.

Time Published: 2025-01-16T12:36:37Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s TSM fourth-quarter results beat forecasts, fueled by demand for advanced processor node technologies for artificial intelligence applications. The contract chipmaker, which supplies chips for Nvidia Corp’s NVDA graphics processing unit (GPU) and Apple, Inc’s AAPL smartphones, guided first-quarter revenue above the consensus. Taiwan Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter revenue of $26.88 billion (NT$868.46 billion), up 38.8% year-over-year, topping the analyst consensus estimate of $26.28 billion. Also Read: OPEC’s Optimism Clashes With IEA’s Conservative 2025 Oil Growth Projections Net income and earnings per share were NT$374.68 billion and NT$14.45 per share ($2.24) versus analyst consensus of $2.23. In dollar terms, revenue growth was 37.0% year over year and 14.4% quarter over quarter. The top-line performance aligned with the company’s guidance of $26.1 billion—$26.9 billion. Taiwan Semiconductor said its business was supported by demand for its 3-nm and 5-nm technologies. However, it expects smartphone seasonality to impact the first quarter, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. The company said 3-nm accounted for 26% of the total revenue, 5-nm accounted for 34%, and 7-nm technologies accounted for 14%. 7-nm and more advanced technologies comprised 74% of the total wafer revenue. Margin Profile: Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI technology moat helped it expand its fourth-quarter gross margins by 600 bps to 59%, as its 3-nm and 5-nm chips gain traction at the cost of Intel Corp INTC and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, which struggled to transition into advanced nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor’s operating margin expanded by 740 bps to 49%. Outlook: Taiwan Semiconductor is guided for first-quarter 2025 revenue of $25.0 billion-$25.8 billion versus the $24.97 billion consensus estimate. It expects a gross margin of 57%—59% and operating profit margins of 46.5%—48.5%. The company earmarked fiscal 2025 capex worth $38 billion-$42 billion (versus $29.8 billion a year ago) amid intensifying geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with the former eying tougher artificial intelligence technology restrictions on the latter, citing national security concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 103% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to semiconductor manufacturing stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. Price Action: TSM stock traded higher by 4.86% at $216.85 premarket at the last check on Thursday. Also Read: Photo by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: ‘Deeply alarmed’: 400 Washington Post journalists demand Jeff Bezos' intervention – What went wrong?
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/washington-post-deeply-alarmed-400-journalists-demand-jeff-bezos-intervention-what-went-wrong-11737025618889.html
Time Published: 2025-01-16T11:44:23Z
Full Content:
Washington Post has reportedly seen a mass exodus of talent, following which at least 400 journalists have written to the Post's owner Jeff Bezos seeking an intervention, and expressing concern over the future of the esteemed newspaper. The plea from staff comes a week after the The Post laid off roughly 100 employees, amid financial struggles. The layoffs amounted to roughly 4% of the publication’s staff. According to a report by CNN, the list of 400 journalists include some well known correspondents like the publication’s chief correspondent Dan Balz. They have requested Jeff Bezos to visit the Washington, DC, newsroom and speak to the The Post's leaders. The letter, obtained by CNN, read “we are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent.” The Washington Post journalists have said in their letter to Jeff Bezos ‘trust has been lost’ and has sought in-person meeting with billionaire owner over paper’s future. “This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and re-establishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication,” it continues. While the letter to Jeff Bezos doesn’t mention The Post publisher and CEO William Lewis by name, it strongly suggested the staff had lost faith in the newspaper’s leadership. According to CNN, over the past year, William Lewis has made disruptive changes to The Post and been accused of harboring hostility toward the newsroom. Lewis has also reportedly continued to face questions about his journalistic integrity relating to his past work as a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s British newspapers. Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, hired William Lewis little more than a year ago, charging him with turning around the money-losing publication. CNN notes, Jeff Bezos has been a mostly hands-off owner of The Post, and in some ways that has been a blessing, giving the newspaper’s journalists autonomy to write critically about Bezos, Amazon and related topics. The letter acknowledges that Jeff Bezos’s decision to block The Post editorial board’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was “the owner’s prerogative.” The non-endorsement caused hundreds of thousands of Post subscribers to cancel as a form of protest. The Post lost 250,000 subscribers, or 10% of its subscription base, following its decision not to endorse. This reportedly was a massive contributor to the paper losing a whopping $100m in 2024, according to the Wall Street Journal. Digital visitors for the Washington Post website are also down, dropping from 114 million in November 2020 to 54 million in November 2024, according to Guardian report. Jeff Bezos did not immediately comment on the letter that he received. However, last month, in rare public comments about the Post, Bezos said at The New York Times DealBook Summit that the The Post “needs to be put back on a good footing again.” Jeff Bezos didn’t specify how he’ll do that but said, “I have a bunch of ideas and I’m working on that right now.” “We’ve saved the Washington Post once,” Bezos added, and “this will be the second time.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

The slowdown in the job market appears to have affected the most prestigious Ivy League institutes. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report, at least 23 per cent of job-seeking Harvard MBA students who graduated last year were still looking for a job, three months after leaving the campus. The unemployment rate among fresh graduates has increased steadily in recent years with 20 per cent unable to land a job in 2023 and 10 per cent in 2022. The trend extends beyond the Harvard Business School (HBS) with other elite business schools such as Stanford, Wharton, and NYU Stern also reporting some of the weakest job-placement rates. "We're not immune to the difculties of the job market. Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator. You have to have the skills," explained Kisten Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development and alumni relations for HBS. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have reduced MBA recruiting, as have consulting firms, the report highlighted. To salvage the situation, Harvard is now testing an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can compare job seekers' resumes with their preferred roles and recommend online classes to bridge skill gap. While the job market is bad, students who have lowered their expectations have managed to find jobs unlike those still waiting for the top firms to come their way. "Most of my friends who tempered their expectations were able to land great positions. HBS students (are) self-selecting out of certain jobs that may be seen as a 'step down' from their roles before the MBA despite them being perfectly great well-paying jobs," an unnamed HBS MBA student was quoted as saying by Forbes. "HBS students tend to come from wealthier families and backgrounds that can stomach a few months of unemployment."

The latest strategic investment by Nvidia shows its bravery towards industrial AI and robotics. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The chip giant has also provided Taiwan's MetAI with capital in its $4 million seed funding round, making Nvidia its first investment in a Taiwanese company. Kenmec Mechanical Engineering, Solomon Technology, SparkLabs Taiwan, Addin Ventures, and Upstream Ventures were other participants in the funding round. MetAI builds AI-powered digital twin platforms for its own advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities, smart warehouses, and automation systems. It converts a CAD file into a stripped-down SimReady 3D environment within minutes to ease the time to market digital twins for industrial applications. As generative physical AI is an area of increasing focus, Nvidia's partnership with MetAI is a holistic approach to the integration of predictive physical AI that can be trained in simulation environments to deploy robots in autonomous systems. Later this year, the company launched its Mega framework within the Omniverse platform to further digital twin products in the company's broader AI ecosystem.

Title: Meta just flipped the switch that prevents misinformation from spreading in the United States
URL: https://www.platformer.news/meta-ends-misinformation-enforcement-zuckerberg/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
The company built effective systems to reduce the reach of fake news. Last week, it shut them down I. Last week, Meta announced a series of changes to its content moderation policies and enforcement strategies designed to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. The company ended its fact-checking program in the United States, stopped scanning new posts for most policy violations, and created carve-outs in its community standards to allow dehumanizing speech about transgender people and immigrants. The company also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion program. Behind the scenes, the company was also quietly dismantling a system to prevent the spread of misinformation. When the company announced on Jan. 7 that it would end its fact-checking partnerships, the company also instructed teams responsible for ranking content in the company’s apps to stop penalizing misinformation, according to sources and an internal document obtained by Platformer. The result is that the sort of viral hoaxes that ran roughshod over the platform during the 2016 US presidential election — “Pope Francis endorses Trump,” Pizzagate, and all the rest — are now just as eligible for free amplification on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as true stories. In 2016, of course, Meta hadn’t yet invested huge sums in machine-learning classifiers that can spot when a piece of viral content is likely a hoax. But nine years later, after the company’s own analyses found that these classifiers could reduce the reach of these hoaxes by more than 90 percent, Meta is shutting them off. Meta declined to comment on the changes. Instead, it pointed me to a letter and a blog post in which it had hinted that this change was coming. The letter was sent in August by Zuckerberg to Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In it, Zuckerberg expressed his discomfort with the Biden Administration’s efforts to pressure the company to remove certain posts about COVID-19. Zuckerberg also expressed regret that the company had temporarily reduced the distribution of stories about Hunter Biden’s laptop, which Meta and Twitter had both done out of fear that they had been the result of a Russian hack-and-leak operation. The few hours that the story’s distribution was limited would go on to become a Republican cause célèbre. As a kind of retroactive apology for bowing to censorship requests in the past, and for the company’s own actions in the Hunter Biden case, Zuckerberg said that going forward, the company would no longer reduce the reach of posts that had been sent to fact checkers but not yet evaluated. Once they had been evaluated, Meta would continue to reduce the reach of posts that had been designated as false. In hindsight, this turned out to be the first step toward killing off Meta’s misinformation efforts: granting hoaxes a temporary window for expanded reach while they awaited fact checking. That brings us to the blog post: Joel Kaplan’s “More speech, fewer mistakes,” which was published last Tuesday and among other things announced the end of the company’s US fact-checking partnerships. Buried toward the bottom were these two sentences: At the time, Kaplan did not elaborate on which of these demotions the company planned to get rid of. Platformer can now confirm that misinformation-related demotions have been eliminated at the company. The company plans to replace its professional fact-checking program with volunteers from the user base appending information to posts in a system modeled after X’s community notes. But Meta has offered few details on how the program will work, and has not said when it will become available. As a result, Meta has chosen to open a window for viral hoaxes to spread unchecked on its properties while it works to build a new system to mitigate their impact. II. Meta’s efforts to detect misinformation had their roots in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. In response to outrage over the spread of “Pope endorses Trump” and other hoaxes in the run-up to Trump’s election, Meta promised lawmakers and regulators around the world that it would take steps to improve the quality of information on its platforms. From the start of that initiative, Meta’s integrity teams worked hand-in-hand with the third-party fact checkers it hired after the election. In a 2018 blog post, the company explained the variety of signals it used to determine whether its ranking algorithms might be showing you something false: Notably, none of these changes actually eliminated anyone’s freedom of expression. Instead, they restricted what the technologist Aza Raskin has termed “freedom of reach.” Fact-checking and down-ranking obviously false stories allowed liars and hoaxsters to express themselves but sought to limit the negative effects of those lies on Meta’s customers. In May 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Meta boasted about how well this effort was working. In a blog post, the company said that 95 percent of people who saw labels warning that a post contained misinformation declined to view it. The company said that in March 2020 alone, it displayed warnings related to COVID-19 on 40 million posts. Going forward, Meta will instead ask users to add their own annotations to these and other posts. Academics, journalists, lawmakers, and other interested parties will undoubtedly still conduct their own reviews of viral posts on Meta platforms in the coming months to assess the misinformation landscape. But they’ll be doing it without a critical tool they used in the past: CrowdTangle, a free services that exposed what posts on Facebook and Instagram were most popular via searchable real-time dashboards. Meta killed off CrowdTangle in August, directing users instead to an alternative that lacks many of CrowdTangle’s core features. In publishing this story, I realize that I may be giving ammo to those who believe that misinformation is a root cause of our polarization in the United States. As Joe Bernstein wrote in Harper’s 2021, discussions of misinformation sometimes lend too much credence to the idea that algorithms are all-powerful shapers of reality, and fail to reckon with the fact that people will always seek out information that aligns with their worldview. Their demand for that information, whether it is true or false, may be the most important factor leading to its creation and its spread. But it’s possible to believe that a total fixation on misinformation is counterproductive and also believe in the idea of harm reduction: that sophisticated systems that accurately identify hoaxes and then show them to fewer people ought to be left in place, at least until their replacement has been rolled out and evaluated for its effectiveness. For now, these changes only apply to the United States — though you get the sense that Zuckerberg would happily roll them out anywhere else he’s allowed to.

Title: Bannon vs Musk: How Trump’s U-turn on H-1B visas has split MAGA
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/16/bannon-vs-musk-how-trumps-u-turn-on-h-1b-visas-has-split-maga
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:18:29Z
Full Content:
Trump’s tech allies Musk and Ramaswamy are at loggerheads with the MAGA camp over a visa programme that brings foreign workers. Days before Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States, a feud between his tech allies and champions of his far-right MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda over H-1B visas has exploded. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon accused Elon Musk of trying to establish “techno-feudalism on a global scale” in a fresh broadside against the billionaire businessman this week. Bannon’s sharp rhetoric against the controversial visa programme, which allows the hiring of highly skilled tech workers from overseas, has come as others in Trump’s orbit, such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, have also tried to argue that US companies need trained foreign employees. That argument has come under fire not just from Bannon, but also from other far-right supporters of Trump – even as Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, have now softened their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the programme needs to be reformed. But what is the H-1B scheme that is splitting Trump’s allies? Why is it so divisive? Has Trump’s own U-turn on the issue contributed to tensions within the MAGA movement? And how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech – a sector that traditionally leaned towards the Democrats but has in recent weeks almost bent over backwards to placate the incoming president? The H-1B is a temporary and non-immigrant US visa that allows companies in the US to bring in highly skilled workers from abroad. In 2016, Trump called the programme, which was introduced in the 1990s under Republican President George HW Bush, “very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, Trump imposed a temporary ban on H-1B visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. But less than five years later, the US president-elect has thrown his weight behind the visa scheme, saying: “It’s a great programme.” “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B,” he told New York Post. Those comments came at a time when Musk was facing pushback from MAGA supporters. Musk played a key role in Trump’s win as he pumped money into the presidential campaign and used X to megaphone hardline MAGA views. That has earned him Trump’s goodwill and influence. But Trump has pushed back on the notion that Musk enjoys outsized influence. “And no, he’s not taking the presidency,” Trump made the comments during a speech in December, days after the Tesla owner led efforts to kill a spending bill in Congress. Experts say Trump will need to manage a delicate balance between the Silicon Valley elite, whom he needs for his plans to create jobs, and the MAGA base, from where he draws his political support. The H-1B is “the largest temporary work visa” programme in the US, said Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, DC-headquartered think tank. There is an annual cap on the number of H-1B visas guaranteed, set to 65,000 H-1B visas per fiscal year. It is decided by a lottery system, which randomly selects when the number of visa petitions exceeds the cap. The foreign worker must be employed in a specialised occupation with at least a bachelor’s degree. The employer sponsors foreign workers from the fields of information technology, medicine and publication. The visa is granted for three years but can be extended to six years. American and Indian tech companies – and a few consulting firms – dominate the scheme. Six of the top 10 beneficiaries of the scheme in 2024 were US companies, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a nonpartisan think tank on trade and immigration: Amazon, Cognizant, IBM, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Three are Indian: Infosys, TCS and HCL. Capgemini, a French tech and consulting firm, rounds up the list. But there is another, major new beneficiary of the scheme, per the NFAP’s data: Musk’s electric car giant Tesla. In 2024, Tesla won 742 new H-1B visas through the lottery, more than double the 328 it secured in 2023. In addition, Tesla had another 1,025 existing H-1B visas extended in 2024. “Due to data limitations, we don’t have a good sense of the total H-1B visa holders currently in the US. However, as of 2019, close to 600,000 highly skilled immigrants worked in the US economy on H-1B visas. Approximately 120,000 immigrant workers received new H-1B visas in 2024,” Batalova said. However, it isn’t just MAGA advocates who are critical of the scheme. Ronil Hira, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Howard University, said that the H-1B programme needs to be reformed. Problems plaguing the programme, he said, include the poor selection process, where “eligibility standards are too low, so the application lottery is flooded”, and “visa winners are selected by lottery instead of rational criteria”. The recent argument began when far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticised Trump’s pick for artificial intelligence (AI) adviser, Sriram Krishnan, who has argued the US needs more foreign skilled workers to remain competitive in the technology industries. On December 28, Musk threatened to “go to war” on the issue. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk posted. Musk was born in South Africa and previously held an H-1B visa before he became a naturalised US citizen. Ramaswamy jumped on the debate, saying that technology companies hire foreign-born employees because of a difference in culture. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote, without mentioning the H-1B visa. But he later clarified that the H-1B system “is badly broken [and] should be replaced”. Bannon, who served under Trump’s previous term, has called the H-1B programme a “total scam” as it allows tech companies to bring cheap labour from abroad at the cost of American workers. He has called for the deportation of H-1B visa holders as part of the wider deportation plans. He railed particularly against Musk, saying the Tesla owner’s “sole objective is to become a trillionaire. That’s his objective,” Bannon told the Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, on January 8 “He will do anything related to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money. His aggregation of wealth, and then – through wealth – power: that’s what he’s focused on. The American working people in this country are not going to tolerate it.” Batalova explained that immigration has long been a contentious policy area in the US. There are “two existential perspectives battling over the hearts and minds of the American public and voters”, she said. She elaborated that one perspective perceives immigrant workers, such as those on H-1B visas, as contributors to US economic power and global competitiveness. The other perspective views immigrant workers as competitors for jobs and limited economic resources. Batalova added that this struggle has, at the moment, resurged and is “fuelled in big part by voter discontent of how the government handled immigration after the COVID-19 pandemic, but also discussions about economic security and national competitiveness, particularly regarding China”. “Major tech companies and business groups continue to lobby for expanding the programme, arguing it is crucial for maintaining America’s innovative edge. However, layoffs in the tech sector, combined with cases of worker replacement at various companies, have provided ammunition for H-1B critics.” Criticism of the H-1B visa has also come from the left. On December 29, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told Fox News that the H-1B needs to be reformed. “You can’t underpay these H-1B folks coming in,” Khanna said. The programme “shouldn’t be for accountants or entry-level IT jobs. It should really be for exceptional talent. We should have that balance”. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also criticised the H-1B visa programme. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,” he posted on X. Elon Musk is wrong. The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make. pic.twitter.com/Mwz7i9TcSM — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 2, 2025 Around 70 percent of H-1B visa recipients are from India and another 10 percent are from China. As the debate rages in the US, some tech firms have withdrawn job offers to Indian workers, according to a report in the Indian newspaper, Times of India. But India’s Ministry of External Affairs argued that H-1B visas benefit both countries. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further deepening India-US economic ties, which are to our mutual benefit,” Randhir Jaiswal, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, said during a news conference on January 3. Trump’s campaign promises during the election comprised a hardline immigration policy. He has threatened to carry out mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and boost security at the border to prevent asylum seekers from entering the country. A month after he was voted in, he told NBC’s Kristen Welker on a Meet the Press episode that he plans to end birthright citizenship in the US, a policy that has been in place for more than 150 years. The right is guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. However, during the interview, the president-elect said he was willing to work with Democrats to keep “Dreamers”, undocumented people who arrived in the US as children and have lived in the country most of their lives. When it comes to the H-1B visa in Trump’s second term, “no one knows what Trump will do. He did nothing in his first term even though he campaigned to reform the programme. It was a glaring unfulfilled promise”, Hira, of Howard University, said. “The Republicans control Congress [both House and Senate] and the White House, so they have the power to change the programme for better or for worse, or keep the status quo. Will they exercise that power for change? Internal political calculations will dictate the direction they take.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Investing.com-- Seaport upgraded its rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Wednesday, citing expectations for higher subscriber growth as the streaming giant prepares to report its fourth-quarter earnings next week. Seaport upgraded Netflix to Buy from Neutral, with a price target of $955- representing an upside of 12.5% from Wednesday’s close. The brokerage said it expects higher than initially anticipated additions in members- at 9 million in the fourth quarter, compared to prior expectations of 5.7 million. Seaport also sees Netflix’s original content providing strong tailwinds to the stock, especially with the release of the second season of smash hit Squid Games during the quarter. The brokerage said advertising growth, more top content projects and the winning of live sports rights- such as the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson match- all heralded a positive quarter. “NFLX should remain a core holding due to top-line growth, OI margin expansion, and FCF conversion,” Seaport analysts wrote in a note. Netflix will report its December quarter earnings on January 21. The company is expected to clock earnings per share of $4.2 on revenue of $10.13 billion.

Title: NetApp sells Spot and CloudCheckr to cloud cost control company Flexera
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/01/15/netapp-sells-spot-cloudcheckr-cloud-cost-control-company-flexera/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T01:50:06Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 20:50 EST / JANUARY 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley NetApp Inc. is selling a portfolio of its software assets to the cloud cost management specialist Flexera Software LLC. Today’s announcement revealed that Flexera will acquire parts of NetApp’s Spot by NetApp and CloudCheckr products in a deal. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it’s valued at about $100 million, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg noted that the sale likely follows a decision by NetApp to streamline its business and double down on its core operations, in line with a wider industry trend. It added that global asset sales increased by 26% in 2024, rising to almost $555 billion. Spot and CloudCheckr’s tools are used by companies to keep track of the cost of using different cloud computing services. In the case of Spot, it provides continuous automation, optimization and insights around customer’s cloud infrastructure investments, helping them to maximize their cloud resource usage. NetApp bought Spot in 2020 for an undisclosed price, with reports at the time saying it paid in excess of $450 million. Flexera specializes in cloud service orchestration, policy management and cost optimization tools. As such, managing cloud environments is its core business, which may make it a better fit for Spot. In contrast, NetApp is more focused on providing unified data storage that spans cloud and on-premises data center environments. It has some big ambitions to create an intelligent data infrastructure to support generative AI workloads. In addition, it also sells data center hardware based on all-flash storage systems. NAND Research Inc. analyst Steve McDowell told SiliconANGLE that when NetApp acquired Spot almost five years ago, it was focused on building a cloud operations business. “Since that time, NetApp has refined its cloud strategy and today it’s more focused on bringing ONTAP to the public cloud, and it has been one of the more successful cloud storage stories in the industry,” the analyst said. “NetApp is no longer trying to be in the cloud operations business, so that made Spot an awkward fit.” The only slight downside to the deal for NetApp is the reported price it received for Spot. “We don’t know what NetApp’s revenue from Spot was over the past five years, so it’s impossible to know if it broke even,” McDowell added. “I suspect it didn’t, but the sale is still a much better option than just shutting the business down.” Flexera Chief Executive Jim Ryan said the acquisition of Spot will improve its ability to “tackle the proliferation of hybrid cloud cost and usage challenges across public cloud, data centers, SaaS and even AI.” “Acquiring Spot gives Flexera a stellar set of mature cloud FinOps capabilities that it can quickly deploy to its customers,” McDowell said. “It’s a great acquisition for the company, adding new capabilities that give it a really comprehensive set of features for its customers.” Investors seemed to approve of the sale, with NetApp’s stock closing the day up 1.5%, giving it a market capitalization of about $24 billion. In the last year, its stock has risen 35%. Flexera is a privately held firm that was acquired by the equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC in 2020. TA Associates LLC and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board are also said to hold minority stakes in the company.

(Photo: Business Wire) Varda's W-2 mission includes a Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft and a Varda re-entry capsule carrying a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The capsule employs a heatshield with a Thermal Protection System (TPS) developed in collaboration with NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. These payloads are in addition to Varda's expanded pharmaceutical reactor which will expand capability and capacity for pharmaceutical processing. The W-2 mission follows on from Rocket Lab's first mission for Varda, which operated in orbit for eight months before returning to Earth in early 2024 in a successful demonstration of the world's first orbital manufacturing mission conducted outside of the International Space Station. Like the first Pioneer spacecraft for Varda, the W-2 Pioneer is delivering critical mission functions for Varda's 120kg capsule including power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control. Following the payload processing phase in orbit, Rocket Lab's spacecraft will guide and position Varda's capsule for deorbit, enabling a hypersonic re-entry and recovery at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, operated by Southern Launch. The Pioneer spacecraft was designed, built, and tested at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex and headquarters in Long Beach, California. It integrates Rocket Lab's vertically developed components and systems, including star trackers, propulsion systems, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, radios, composite structures, tanks, separation systems, and more. Another Rocket Lab spacecraft is in orbit, performing well, and supporting innovative new space capabilities for our mission partners Varda Space Industries, said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. We've built a deep expertise in guidance, navigation, and control, allowing us to precisely manage spacecraft operations in some of the most demanding environments, ensuring that our customers, like Varda, can rely on us to safely and accurately deliver their mission goals, from on orbit operations to capsule re-entry. "Varda and its partners are building a foundation layer for the orbital economy. The W-2 mission is in service of this goal," said Varda CEO and co-founder Will Bruey. "We are looking forward to many more successful missions, and a world where products made in orbit are seen as commonplace." The W-2 mission is the second of four spacecraft ordered by Varda to support orbital processing, with the third spacecraft complete and awaiting shipment for launch.

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Peter Himler Follow Adventures in Consumer Technology -- Listen Share And It’s Not All About AI In a recent post on resources for discovering podcasts, I noted that 2025 will be a year when those in the PR profession must reconcile the desire by clients for coverage in legacy media versus the potentially greater impact of a whole new cadre of earned media platforms. In the piece, I wrote: “There is nothing like a prominent Wall Street Journal or New York Times feature, let alone a six-minute segment on NBC “Today” or PBS “NewsHour.” But do these traditional media outlets move the needle as much as a widely followed social media star, top-rated podcast, or heavily subscribed newsletter? Could Joe Rogan have more influence than NPR?” It’s an important question for our times and the PR industry. The growing hegemony of podcasts, newsletters, and Insty, TikTok, and YouTube stars may prove more valuable than the productivity gains from AI and machine learning. A well-timed appearance on a top-rated podcast can have a greater impact than an ephemeral story in a paywalled legacy news outlet, with the last election being a primary example. In her Nieman Lab piece, “Podcasting Becomes the Primary Media Strategy, not an Afterthought,” The Podglomerate’s Joni Deutsch observed: “At a time where traditional media trust continues to hit historic lows, podcasts can help long-standing organizations establish stronger relationships with audiences and, in the process, drive real change in how people think and engage with the news.” For years, The New York Times set the national news agenda. A prominent investigative report or fawning profile could easily lead to a Congressional hearing or the A-list, respectively. And while The Times still sets tongues-a-waggin’, its paywalled content does not travel as far and wide as a top influencer’s social media post or podcast episode. Diminished trust in mainstream media is another barrier, but that’s a topic for a different day. These once-pedestrian content formats are truly ascendant with their ability to ratchet up digital eyeballs and a measurable increase in awareness, product sales, or even stock price. They have legs. It’s no wonder TikTok is doubling down on e-commerce. As for real-time platforms, Twitter once had the unique capacity to create national story memes, in part due to the myriad journalists and (actual) verified users who loitered and amplified on the platform. No longer. An Elon-remade Twitter has X’d into a cesspool of misinformation, conspiracy, and anger, e.g., Thus, many in the fourth estate have abandoned his propaganda machine and migrated to Meta-owned Threads, only to learn that its algorithm suppresses breaking news in favor of titillating content. Strangely, Threads also hinders engagement with others and now, along with its sister platforms Instagram and Facebook, will follow X into the fact-free zone under the guise of free speech. Most recently, BlueSky is enjoying its moment in the sun. Founded, but abandoned by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, this more civil platform has usurped both X and Threads as a safe , real-time resource for journalists. In December, it surpassed 25 million registered users. Don’t ignore it. Here’s a BlueSky post from Julie Brown, the Miami Herald investigative reporter who doggedly broke the Jeffrey Epstein story: Then there are the countless newsletters that regularly arrive in your inbox. They reside on self-publishing platforms like Substack, Beehiiv, or Ghost and often feature the work of prominent journalists, many refugees of big-branded legacy media who’ve forsaken their once high and mighty perches to go it alone. Lester Wunderman, eat your heart out. Some of my favorite newsletters include Casey Newton’s “Platformer,” Jedd Legum’s “Popular Information,” Oliver Darcy’s “Status,” Dan Perry’s “Ask Questions Later,” Taylor Lorenz’s “User Mag,” and any of those emanating from Axios, Puck, Semafor, or The Information. As for AI, make no mistake: we’re witnessing a whirlwind of promising use cases for PR practitioners. They range from analyzing a journalist’s past coverage before an interview to condensing a laboriously long media pitch to its “Smart Brevity”-style essence. Here’s a piece on one AI platform that I’ve found especially beneficial to the clients of my firm. What will not change for PR pros who compete in the earned media relations game is the requirement that they stay informed, inquisitive, and immersed in as much client-relevant content as possible, no matter how it arrives. Finally, as we head into 2025, I’d like to give a shout-out to some of the newer media outlets that have embraced quality journalism. Paramount among them is ProPublica for its essential, First Amendment-protected investigative reporting that holds wrong-doers to account. Happy New Year.

Title: How Biden Is Solidifying His A.I. Legacy in His Last Week as President

Time Published: 2025-01-15T22:26:21Z

With less than a week left in office, President Joe Biden yesterday (Jan. 14) signed an executive order to streamline A.I. infrastructure across the U.S. Aimed at bolstering the country’s competitive advantage over the technology, the order earmarks federal sites for A.I. data centers built by private companies. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. “Cutting-edge A.I. will have profound implications for national security and enormous potential to improve Americans’ lives if harnessed responsibly, from helping cure disease to keeping communities safe by mitigating the effects of climate change,” said Biden in a statement. “However, we cannot take our lead for granted.” The order directs the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to identify at least three sites where the private sector can build A.I. data centers. Developers tapped for the land will have to pay for the construction and operation of these facilities. In a nod to the massive amounts of energy needed to power A.I. infrastructure, private companies developing on federal land will also be required to bring enough clean energy resources to match these data centers’ electricity needs. The A.I. revolution has spurred a dramatic rise in the energy consumption of such facilities, which accounted for 4 percent of the nation’s total electricity use last year—a figure that could more than double to 9.1 percent by the end of the decade, according to data from the Electric Power Research Institute. Speeding up A.I. data center development is also a key component of Biden’s new order, which urged agencies to prioritize “expeditious” permitting of A.I. infrastructure on federal land. Opportunities to hasten this process could include establishing “categorical exclusions” under the National Environmental Policy Act for infrastructure that doesn’t have significant environmental impacts, according to White House officials. The executive order came a day after the Biden Administration announced a new framework for the exporting of chips used to power A.I. products. In addition to placing further restrictions on exports to countries like China and Russia, the new rule calls for a 50,000-chip cap per country for most of the world. The rule, which cannot be enforced for 120 days, was met with pushback from impacted countries and major industry players alike. “We believe it is also in the U.S. economic and security interest that the E.U. buys advanced A.I. chips from the U.S. without limitations,” said the European Commission’s tech and security head Henna Virkkunen and trade chief Maroš Šefčovič in a joint statement. U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), meanwhile, called the framework “misguided,” describing it as one that “threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide” in a blog post. “We’re trying to strike the right balance between ensuring the frontier of A.I. stays in the [U.S.] and our close allies while also ensuring that the rest of the world can benefit from A.I. and get the hardware that they need to power A.I. applications going forward,” said Jake Sullivan, the White House national security advisor, while defending the A.I. chip framework in a press briefing earlier this week. “We think this is, in a bipartisan spirit, the way to best preserve and protect America’s lead when it comes to artificial intelligence.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Is It Time to Turn Bullish on IONQ Stock after the Quantum Freefall?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. IonQ (IONQ) stock has slumped along with other names in the quantum computing sector following comments made by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in early January. However, despite the free-falling share price and cheapening valuation, I’m bearish. This stock rose on the expectation that a quantum revolution was potentially just around the corner, but the reality is that investors will need to be very patient. The stock still looks overvalued, and it’s operating in a crowded space, so not every company will make it. As such, I don’t think it’s time to buy IonQ stock. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener IonQ is a pioneering quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to develop quantum computers. Unlike traditional approaches, IonQ’s method employs lasers to manipulate individual atoms as qubits, potentially enabling longer and more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors. It’s all incredibly interesting, and judging by the company’s robust set of announcements towards the end of 2024, this approach has positioned IonQ as a leader in the quantum computing industry — at least among small caps. However, recent comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have sent quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, into a tailspin. During Nvidia’s CES 2025 event, Huang suggested that practical quantum computers might be 15 to 30 years away from realization. It’s a disappointing timeline, but likely the reality check that the stock market needed. Following Huang’s remarks, IonQ’s stock plummeted by around 40%, alongside significant drops in other quantum computing companies. The market reaction highlights the speculative nature of the quantum computing sector and the substantial gap between current capabilities and commercial viability. One of the reasons why I’m bearish is because IonQ operates in an increasingly crowded quantum computing segment, where many companies are likely to struggle to survive in the long term. The quantum computing landscape is teeming with both established tech giants and innovative startups, all vying for dominance in this nascent field. With major players like IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) investing heavily in quantum technology, alongside numerous smaller companies like Rigetti (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), the competition is fierce. The Gartner hype cycle suggests that while there will be winners in quantum computing, there will also be many losers — currently, we appear to be heading towards Gartner’s trough of disillusionment, which is a period after the peak of inflated expectations. Some firms will inevitably run out of funding as they pursue approaches that prove difficult to scale or simply execute their strategies poorly. This is particularly concerning for a company like IonQ, which, despite its innovative trapped-ion approach, faces significant challenges in commercialization and profitability. Furthermore, before the late 2024 bull run that preceded the free fall, pure-play quantum computing stocks were facing several challenges, including talent and funding. While IonQ’s cash reserves provide a decent runway, the company continues to lose money. However, a late 2024 deal worth $54.5 million with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to develop quantum networking hardware provided a boost to the company’s credentials. As noted, IonQ is expected to remain unprofitable for a while, which reinforces my bearishness as it’s hard to construct a valuation-based thesis when profitability is so many years away. Despite this, its revenue projections are promising. The company’s revenue is forecast to grow significantly, with estimates showing a consistent upward trend from $41.6 million in 2024 to $314.6 million by 2027. This represents a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 96% over the four-year period. Due to this impressive revenue growth, IonQ’s forward price-to-sales ratios are expected to decrease from 167.9x in 2024 to 22.2x in 2027, indicating that the stock’s valuation may become more attractive over time. However, this is still very expensive compared to other parts of the market, and investors should note that the company’s continued losses may pose risks, even as its top line expands rapidly. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price target is $37, implying about 34% upside potential. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m bearish on IonQ despite its innovative technology and promising revenue growth projections. The lengthy timeline for quantum computing commercialization, coupled with the stock’s current valuation, makes it a speculative play. IonQ operates in an intensely competitive sector where many players are unlikely to survive, and its ongoing losses amplify the risks. While analyst ratings highlight some optimism and the company’s partnerships are definitely noteworthy, the broader market challenges and uncertain path to profitability cannot be ignored. Until IonQ demonstrates clearer progress toward scalability and commercial viability, it remains a high-risk investment suited only for incredibly patient, long-term investors.

However, this is still very expensive compared to other parts of the market, and investors should note that the company’s continued losses may pose risks, even as its top line expands rapidly. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price target is $37, implying about 34% upside potential. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m bearish on IonQ despite its innovative technology and promising revenue growth projections. The lengthy timeline for quantum computing commercialization, coupled with the stock’s current valuation, makes it a speculative play. IonQ operates in an intensely competitive sector where many players are unlikely to survive, and its ongoing losses amplify the risks. While analyst ratings highlight some optimism and the company’s partnerships are definitely noteworthy, the broader market challenges and uncertain path to profitability cannot be ignored. Until IonQ demonstrates clearer progress toward scalability and commercial viability, it remains a high-risk investment suited only for incredibly patient, long-term investors. As a result, I’m going to look beyond analysts’ targets on this occasion. Sign in to access your portfolio

Quantum computing stocks continued rallying Wednesday after quantum-related announcements from both Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%) and Microsoft (MSFT+1.41%). Quantum Computing stock was up by more than 55% at the market close on Wednesday. IonQ (IONQ-4.50%) shares closed up by 33.5%, while Rigetti Computing (RGTI-11.39%) and D-Wave Quantum both saw shares up by around 22% at the close. The stocks climbed Tuesday morning after plunging earlier in the week and the previous week off of doubts by both Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META+0.46%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced Tuesday that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Huang will join quantum executives from companies including D-Wave and Rigetti, the chipmaker said, “to discuss where quantum computing is headed.” Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said. Meanwhile, Microsoft released a blog post Tuesday calling 2025 “[t]he year to become Quantum-Ready.” “We are at the advent of the reliable quantum computing era,” said Mitra Azizirad, chief operating officer of strategic missions and technologies at Microsoft. “And we are right on the cusp of seeing quantum computers solve meaningful problems and capture new business value.” The tech giant also announced its Quantum Ready program to prepare business leaders for quantum computing opportunities.

Title: Stock market today: Dow jumps 700 points, Nasdaq soars 2.5% after cool CPI reading

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts. What to know before you accept the loan. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks. Patient investors looking not only for growth, but for protection during market volatility, should take a closer look. With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Passive indexes routinely clobber funds actively managed by professional stock pickers. Last year was no exception. The S&P 500 Gained More Than 50% During Biden's Presidency They can be a smart way to borrow, provided you’re aware of the risks. Skip the expensive tax software this year.

Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts. What to know before you accept the loan. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks. Patient investors looking not only for growth, but for protection during market volatility, should take a closer look. With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).

Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates.

I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts. What to know before you accept the loan. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks. Patient investors looking not only for growth, but for protection during market volatility, should take a closer look. With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).

Title: Netflix Signals No Change in 'Woke' Brand as Hollywood & Tech World Drops DEI Obsession for 2nd Trump Term

Netflix’s response to President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection victory is the scheduled premier of a documentary on Duchess of Sussex Megan Markle, a symbol of Hollywood wokism. Netflix, a streaming service giant that openly works with the Obamas, does not appear to be willing to shift its left-leaning corporate scope following Trump’s reelection as did Meta and Amazon. With Netflix’s earning call set for the end of January, its investor relations team refused to respond when Breitbart News requested comment about whether it had plans to defund DEI programs, publish content more friendly to President Trump, or distance itself from the Obamas. Co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos’ apparent unwillingness to rebalance the company’s corporate scope stands in contrast to actions taken by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bozos. Meta shut down its biased fact checking program and added CEO of UFC and Trump supporter Dana White to its board. Amazon picked up the Melania Trump documentary. Before the November election, Bozos’ Washington Post refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris. “It is clear Netflix programming buyers at all levels have gotten an order from the top, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, not to touch content that is friendly toward MAGA or Trump,” said a producer with knowledge of Netflix’s political identity. “Other studios and streamers have publicly made a fast shift but Netflix execs at all levels are obviously scared.” Corporate shifts are common when political environments change. Just as DEI programs became popular after the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots that cost municipalities millions, companies like Lockheed Martin are announcing new government affairs personnel to work the incoming administration. Netflix’s silent position on the incoming administration is exacerbated by the streamer’s ongoing commitment to invest $100 million of shareholder money in DEI programs, CNBC reported: Netflix released a first-of-its-kind diversity study Friday to analyze the makeup of Netflix’s on-screen talent, as well as the behind-the-camera creators, producers, writers and directors. The report shows that the company has made progress, but still has more work to do to close diversity gaps. The company says it’s committing to an “inclusion lens” to its work, which co-CEO Ted Sarandos says means asking questions like, “Whose voice is missing? Is this portrayal authentic? Who is excluded?” The company also announced the creation of the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which will invest $100 million over the next five years in organizations that help underrepresented communities train and find jobs in TV and film. Netflix also committed to releasing an update on this study every two years through 2026. During the first years of the Biden administration, Netflix made overtures to conservatives by opposing authoritarian speech codes when it refused to cancel comedian Dave Chapelle on its platform. The decision helped Netflix steadily climb its way out of financial ruin in 2022. The streaming service’s stock price rebounded and experts project it to perform well into 2025. One of Netflix’s most anticipated projects this year is the release of a documentary on the Duchess of Sussex Megan Markle, who is an outspoken opponent of Donald Trump. Netflix will also continue to work with the Obamas and their production company. “Netflix is proud to partner with Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions. Watch the acclaimed, award-winning movies and series they’ve brought to life,” the site advertises. Aligning with DEI, Netflix’s claims one of its values is “Inclusion — you recognize your biases and work to counteract them; you work to ensure everyone at Netflix can do their best work, whatever their culture, identity or background.” Netflix’s political corporate scope is amplified by their employees. Co-founder Reed Hastings reportedly donated $7 million to the Harris campaign. Nearly 100 percent of the Netflix employee donations, amounting to approximately $4.4 million, were in support of Democrats in 2024, according to Quiver Quantitative. “BI DEN,” Netflix’s social media head Lucie Zhang, who identifies as “She/Her” on LinkedIn, posted on X. Netflix’s vice president of inclusion Wade Davis II praised Michelle Obama’s DNC speech: “#MichelleObama brought both hands during her speech!!! Yes!!!! Let’s Go Kamala.” Trump won a landslide reelection in November with over 77 million votes, just short of Netflix’s reported 84.8 million paid streaming subscribers across the United States and Canada in the third quarter of 2024. The subscriber growth number slowed last quarter. This begs the question why Netflix would be exclusionary to this large audience. Following Trump’s victory, Sarandos, a big Obama donor, bent the knee and visited him at Mar-a-Lago, a pilgrimage several tech executives made, given the the scale of their business and the need to navigate regulatory hurdles. “EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND,” Trump posted on Truth Social after the meetings. What comes of it remains to be seen. Wendell Husebo is a political reporter with Breitbart News and a former RNC War Room Analyst. He is the author of Politics of Slave Morality.

Title: Washington Post staffers urge owner Jeff Bezos to meet in scathing letter: 'We are deeply alarmed'

Fox News congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie has more on who will be in attendance and policies President-elect Donald Trump will enact during his first day in office on 'Special Report.' Hundreds of Washington Post staffers sent a letter to owner Jeff Bezos on Wednesday expressing grave concern at recent leadership decisions and the ensuing exodus of high-profile colleagues, asking for a meeting with the billionaire so the newspaper could retain its "competitive edge." "We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent," the letter obtained by Fox News Digital states. Alluding to Bezos' decision to quash the liberal editorial board's planned endorsement last year of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, the letter said this went far beyond that particular decision, which it called Bezos' "prerogative." "This is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and reestablishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication," the letter states, reportedly signed by more than 400 staffers. "We urge you to come to our office and meet with Post leaders, as you have in the past, about what has been happening at the Post. We understand the need for change, and we are eager to deliver the news in innovative ways. But we need a clear vision we can believe in." Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (The New York Times DealBook Summit 2024 Live/posted by Andrew Ross Sorkin) ANTI-TRUMP COLUMNIST JENNIFER RUBIN QUITS WASHINGTON POST, BLASTS OWNER JEFF BEZOS The staffers also pushed Bezos to recall his words when he purchased the newspaper in 2013 and help reaffirm the "values" of the paper. The Amazon chief, who is one of the richest men in the world, had largely been hands-off with regards to the paper's editorial decisions. The letter appears to be the latest indication of a lack of faith by Post staffers in publisher Will Lewis, whom Bezos tapped to lead the paper a year ago. Bezos had already infuriated staffers in October with his decision to cancel the Harris endorsement at the 11th hour of the election, which Lewis supported. "It’s an implicit vote of no confidence in Will Lewis and a plea for Bezos' direct engagement and involvement," former Post media writer Paul Farhi told Fox News Digital of the letter, which was first leaked out to NPR on Wednesday. In recent weeks, the Post has seen the departures of such figures as reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and Leigh Ann Caldwell, columnists Jennifer Rubin and Charles Lane, health and science editor Stephen Smith and veteran editor Matea Gold.

(Screenshot/Washington Post | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON POST 'RUDDERLESS' AS BEZOS' PAPER ENGULFED BY LAYOFFS, TALENT EXODUS AHEAD OF TRUMP'S SECOND TERM In Rubin's case, she specifically said her decision was about Bezos, decamping for a liberal start-up called The Contrarian. "Corporate and billionaire owners of major media outlets have betrayed their audiences’ loyalty and sabotaged journalism’s sacred mission – defending, protecting and advancing democracy. The Washington Post’s billionaire owner and enlisted management are among the offenders," she wrote. "They have undercut the values central to The Post’s mission and that of all of journalism integrity, courage, and independence. I cannot justify remaining at The Post," she continued. "Jeff Bezos and his cronies accommodate and enable the most acute threat to American democracy – Donald Trump – at a time when a vibrant free press is more essential than ever to our democracy’s survival and capacity to thrive." WASHINGTON POST BEGINS LAYOFFS, CUTTING 4 PERCENT OF WORKFORCE Andrew Ross Sorkin and Jeff Bezos speak during The New York Times Dealbook Summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Dec. 4, 2024, in New York City. (Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for The New York Times) Editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members also resigned last year when Bezos spiked the Harris endorsement. The Post lost a staggering 250,000 subscribers over the move, which was viewed by staff as a capitulation by Bezos to Donald Trump before the election and a betrayal of the paper's values. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes also resigned from The Post earlier this month after the outlet refused to publish her cartoon depicting Bezos groveling to Trump. Former executive editor Sally Buzbee left the Post last June after Lewis' reshuffling of the newsroom. The paper has also been hit by recent headlines about huge declines in web traffic, a reported $77 million loss in 2024, and a round of layoffs earlier this month on its business side.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc (META): ‘I Find It To Be Little More Prurient’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks. In one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, "Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming." He shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. "House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter," Cramer remarked. He added "What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough." Another news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could "be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal." One person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. "I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top," believes Cramer. He added "We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state." On the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months "Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership," he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes "you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow." Finally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared "I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified." Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated "I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The technology-focused nature of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg proved to be a boon for the stock in 2024. Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s shares ended the year 69% higher as investors were optimistic about its ability to monetize AI by selling features to advertisers. The firm also enjoys a strong moat in the AI sector as it has developed a foundational AI model. In 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s been in the news for scrapping fact-checking in the US and for Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Here's what Cramer said: "I know Meta AI is supposed to be the most exciting. I find it to be little more prurient. When it comes to the metaverse I thought that Ralph Lauren was supposed to have a mall right next to, I don't know, Macy's. Hasn't really turned out that way but at the same time the dialogue has switched mostly to Taekwondo and rifles. And David, you better start shooting pigs [referring to Zuckerberg's hobby of hunting boars] if you want to be on board here. Overall META ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: We Are All Going to Pay For the L.A. Fires

By Lois Parshley This article was originally published by The Lever, an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever’s free newsletter. Over a year before Los Angeles’ uncontrollable wildfires burned through neighborhoods once considered safe, the office of California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara quietly shared a potential regulatory plan with insurance company lobbyists. It was a draft of reforms that would allow insurers to raise rates and pass costs on to consumers, among other industry-friendly changes, in exchange for little more than the companies’ word that they would cover homes in wildfire-prone areas. “What do you think of the language below,” one lobbyist responded, according to records obtained by The Lever, along with a detailed edit. “I am really trying to get them to a happy place,” she wrote, referring to her insurance-industry client. The changes the lobbyist suggested appeared to be included in legislation floated in September 2023, although the potential bill was dropped after an advocacy group leaked a recording of industry lobbyists loudly bragging about their role in the bill’s development. Several weeks later, Lara announced a package of executive actions that covered similar ground. “The current system is not working for all Californians, and we must change course,” said Lara, a Democrat elected in 2018 with the help of significant donations from the insurance industry. “I will continue to partner with all those who want to work toward real solutions.” Lara did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The emails are just one example of the conflicts of interest behind the reforms the commissioner has made to address California’s insurance crisis. As record wildfires flare up all over California, homeowners have faced skyrocketing prices, and many have found they can no longer find insurance at all. Meanwhile, insurers claim California’s regulations have kept premiums artificially low, and many are leaving the state. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The clock is ticking to find a solution, since L.A.’s fires, estimated to cost $250 billion in total economic damage, may bring the situation to a breaking point — with repercussions far beyond California. Many homeowners in the state have turned to an insurance program called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan. Created for people who can’t find insurance through the market and run by insurance companies under the commissioner’s oversight, FAIR Plan policies are often more expensive and provide less coverage than traditional plans. As private insurers fled California, the program swelled over 60 percent in the last year. It now has $450 billion in liabilities, though it only has about $385 million in funds to handle them. The outstanding balance, thanks to Lara’s recent deals with the industry, can now be passed on to homeowners. It’s a predicament that will likely soon occur all over the country. When state last-resort insurance programs can’t afford to cover mounting climate disasters, the recovery costs will be shifted from insurers to the general public, with potentially disastrous consequences. “These states are putting our national economy at risk,” says Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace. The FAIR Plan’s vast liabilities are “a big gamble,” Victoria Roach, president of California’s insurer of last resort, told the state legislature last spring.

Fires. We Can’t Let Them “Are these wildfires that disaster?” asked Ben Keys, an economist and professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. As L.A. continued to burn, the FAIR Plan had an estimated $5.85 billion worth of policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood decimated by the fires — an area that plan administrators considered among its top five exposures to wildfire risk anywhere in the state. Preliminary estimates of the insurance losses total over $10 billion — although Keys expects the total to be far higher. How the FAIR Plan will cope is a warning for the rest of the country, where these kinds of state insurance programs have grown over 200 percent in the last five years. Many don’t have enough set aside to pay claims while taking on enormous risks. In the scorched concrete of the Pacific Coast Highway, where the flames ran all the way to the sand, the limits of what can be insured and what can be rebuilt are emerging with aching clarity. It’s an unwelcome, overdue reckoning. When the wind began on what was still an ordinary Tuesday, Jess Miller tried to reassure herself. She had lived all her life in Altadena, California, a diverse and picturesque suburb north of the city. Her mind instinctively jumped to fire, but she wasn’t especially worried about her own neighborhood. “I figured it would be like always,” she says, “something that would stay up in the mountains, and we’d be OK.” But around dinner, Miller looked out her window and was shocked to see orange flames. The heat rose to meet her when she stepped outside, thick and pressing against her face like a warning. “It’s like the fire could do anything,” she said. They weren’t in an official evacuation zone, but “we knew that it was just time.” She and her husband grabbed their five-year-old daughter and a few essentials and fled, swerving through choking smoke around cars that had been abandoned in place. That night, the house and a studio containing all of Miller’s art burned to the ground. Only the chimney remained. “There’s nothing left,” she says. “You don’t even think about the kinds of things that you grab until it’s too late.” Losing her house is not the end, but the beginning of a frightening financial journey. Miller rented from her father, who had purchased only nominal insurance coverage. Not only is he unlikely to be able to recoup his own full losses, but as a policyholder in the state, he’s on the hook to help bail out insurers themselves. In 2024, Lara made a big change to how the FAIR plan covered its vast liabilities. Previously, if a massive wildfire depleted the program’s funds, it could force private insurance companies operating in the state to cover the gap. But last July, Lara announced that in the “extremely unlikely event” this occurred, insurance companies could shift most of the costs to consumers — a tactic states like Florida and Louisiana have also turned to as their insurer-of-last-resort programs swell. Now, California insurers are allowed to charge half of the first billion dollars of any residential damages they’re asked to pay to policyholders — along with unlimited losses beyond that. With over 12,000 structures destroyed by L.A.’s fires so far, that “extremely unlikely event” is looming. The last time the FAIR Plan assessed insurers was after a 1994 earthquake that rocked L.A. — and almost all the insurers that provided earthquake coverage subsequently left the state. Lara has received significant contributions from the insurance industry, including $270,000 during his initial campaign for insurance commissioner as well as after he took office in 2019. During his reelection bid, he also accepted $125,000 from two LGBTQ groups after they received similar amounts from the insurance industry. (He previously accepted $65,000 of campaign donations from oil and gas companies over the course of his career as a state senator before rejecting efforts to require insurers to disclose their investments in fossil fuels.) According to emails obtained by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog and reviewed by The Lever, in August 2023, Lara’s office shared preliminary ideas for passing insurance costs onto consumers with lobbyists representing the insurers that had backed his campaigns. The emails’ recipients included the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the California Personal Insurance Federation, and lobbyists representing insurance agents and brokers, which together have contributed at least $21,000 to Lara’s political coffers. “He’s made no qualms about developing his plan with the industry and being proud of that,” says Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog. Lara says the FAIR Plan changes are a necessary part of a series of regulatory reforms designed to help keep insurance companies operating in the state. Other reforms included permitting insurers to set rates by using private “catastrophe models” that factor in climate trends and in some cases walking back wildfire-mitigation discounts he’d previously introduced. In return, Lara promised that insurance companies would significantly expand their coverage areas in the state, insuring 85 percent of homeowners in wildfire areas. “For the first time in history, we are requiring insurance companies to expand where people need help the most,” Lara said in a December 2024 statement. “With our changing climate, we can no longer look to the past.” But the regulation’s fine print shows insurers actually have the option to increase their coverage by as little as 5 percent — and even that requirement can be excused if the companies claim they are unable to meet the condition after two years. Advocacy groups say the catastrophe models are expected to increase rates for many property owners, but the state’s Department of Insurance itself failed to conduct a cost analysis. California has hired just one person to oversee the accuracy of the new climate catastrophe models. Florida, in comparison, has a multidisciplinary team of experts to review catastrophe models and compare them to a public version developed by the state. “Administering the FAIR plan properly” would be just one reason for California to develop a more robust analysis, “rather than simply relying on not publicly transparent private-vendor modeling,” says Madison Condon, a professor of law at Boston University who researches climate risk in financial institutions. One of the first catastrophe models filed with the state this winter came from Moody’s RMS, a company that rates the financial stability of insurance companies. Moody’s largest shareholder is the massive holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Moody’s other top shareholders include financial services companies like The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. — who control substantial investment portfolios for insurance companies and who’ve both left a global agreement to fight climate change. “It creates a bit of financial conflict when the ratings company is selling the tools it wants insurers to use to set rates,” says Consumer Watchdog’s Balber. Insurance companies may feel pressure to buy and use Moody’s model because they are dependent on the company for good credit ratings. If the model overpredicts risks, insurance companies can justify raising rates, increasing profits as well as management fees for BlackRock. “It’s an unvirtuous circle,” Balber says. Commissioner Lara has a history with Berkshire Hathaway. In 2019. Lara held a “relationship building” lunch with company executives benefiting his reelection campaign; after the meeting came to light, Lara was forced to return donations from executives of Berkshire Hathaway-owned companies. Lara later intervened multiple times — including overruling a judge — on behalf of one of those donors, the executive of an underwriting company then owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Not even the fiercest consumer advocates dispute that the climate crisis has radically reshaped the landscape of risk. Scientists say rapidly growing fires like the ones torching Los Angeles have increased almost 250 percent over the past 20 years. But “what the industry has done in California is take those real costs,” Balber says, and “used them to try and leverage deregulation.” There’s a lot of money at stake. Unaccounted-for wildfire and flood risk threatens as much as $2.7 trillion dollars in the U.S. housing market, says David Burt, founder and CEO of DeltaTerra Capital. He estimates that just under one in five homes nationwide are at risk. What to do about all of that unpriced risk would be much easier to figure out with more information. “What we’re missing is the kind of granular, localized data that would allow us to see the impacts on insurance premiums and claims in particular communities,” says Carly Fabian, policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. To understand potential disruptions in insurance markets, the Biden administration issued an executive order in 2021 tasking the Treasury Department and the Federal Insurance Office with collecting data on the problem. Insurance companies pushed back, calling it an “unreasonable burden.” The Treasury reversed course, accepting an anonymized subset of the data from state insurance offices — and even that has yet to be made public. “Right now, we actually have less information on insurance than we did about mortgages prior to the 2008 financial crisis,” says Fabian. Just how much insurers are currently losing responding to catastrophes is hard to pin down. There were 27 different billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. in 2024, trailing a record set just the year before. However, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the insurance industry still made a record $87.6 billion in profits in 2023 thanks to higher premiums — and was on track to make even more in 2024. When asked if California’s fires might result in higher homeowner premiums nationally, Fabian explained that insurers already regularly distribute costs. Because the industry is overseen by state governments, there are different rules for rate-setting across the country. Some researchers have found this leads to higher premiums in states with weaker oversight, regardless of the location’s actual risk. “If there isn’t strong regulation,” Fabian says, states are “just relying on a pinky promise that these companies aren’t going to price gouge a product that’s fundamental to the American economy.” She says greater transparency is essential to address the costs of an increasingly perilous world. Nowhere is that information scarcity more obvious than in reinsurance, or the insurance that insurers buy to reduce their own risk. An insurer that covers thousands of homes in a hurricane-prone region like Florida, for example, might take out a reinsurance policy that agrees to pay some of the claims if a storm triggers widespread damage. Starting this month, Lara announced insurance companies would be allowed to pass the costs of their reinsurance on to consumers. Records requests reveal the commissioner’s office hired a consultant from Milliman, a firm that works for the insurance industry, to draft the policy. The change also allows companies to increase their premiums through a calculation that includes catastrophe bond pricing, a volatile security market. There was no opportunity for public comment. In a study last year, Benjamin Keys of the Wharton School used mortgage data to compare insurance premiums across states, a workaround to the persistent information gaps that he says have “allowed a very opaque market.” He found premiums had increased by 33 percent since 2020, mostly due to higher reinsurance costs, along with inflation. Reinsurance is a largely unregulated global market, and insurance companies usually don’t disclose the terms of their contracts. But even with large payouts, reinsurers like Swiss Re and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group made huge profits in 2023 and 2024, with the industry’s total capital hitting a record $695 billion last year. That’s nearly five times more than the world’s largest oil company made in 2023. Passing on reinsurance costs has already contributed to the homeowners’ affordability crisis. Last year, a month after State Farm canceled 70 percent of its policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, the company sought to raise its remaining premiums by 30 percent. While Commissioner Lara said the request raised “serious questions about its financial condition,” the company had quietly been buying hundreds of millions worth of reinsurance it didn’t need from its own parent company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. According to calculations by Consumer Watchdog, State Farms’s reinsurance costs were markedly worse than other large home insurers in the state. “The company is blaming reinsurance for its pullbacks in the market when we have clear evidence that it’s overpaying,” says Consumer Watchdog’s Balber. State Farm did not respond to interview requests. Nevertheless, in September, Lara approved State Farm’s request to reduce the discounts it offers homeowners for wildfire mitigation and absolved the company from explaining to consumers what factors it uses to determine rates or how it decides whether to cover properties. Yet unlike private insurers like State Farm, the state’s FAIR Plan isn’t required to have the same reserves to cover claims. In public testimony last year, the FAIR Plan’s president told the legislature the program had only about $2.5 billion in reinsurance — which Los Angeles’ fire damage is almost guaranteed to exceed, many times over. Since insurers now have a cap on their obligations, homeowners will be stuck with the difference. If those costs balloon, Crawford asks, “Does the state bail out the FAIR Plan? Does the federal government get asked to come and bail out the states?” As last resort programs metastasize across the country, who’s on the hook to pay for climate damage, and under what conditions, should be decided before the eventual emergency arises. Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2019, suggests one solution would be a federal reinsurance program, which could provide lower-priced nonprofit reinsurance for last-resort programs. It could be paired, Jones suggests, with federal low-income subsidies similar to the health benefit exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. California Sen. Adam Schiff (D) introduced an even more ambitious bill in Congress last year that would develop a national reinsurance program for all hazards, including for private insurers, in exchange for writing flood coverage that would eventually replace the troubled National Flood Insurance Program. Some kind of major shift in national policies is unavoidable, Jones says. “I do think that we are continuing to march towards an uninsurable future in this country,” he adds, “because we’re not dealing with the root cause of this problem, which is climate change.” It’s increasingly clear the center cannot hold: The odds of floods or fires are already driving down home values in the most vulnerable areas. Meanwhile, rising insurance costs have started to slow sales and cause price declines in risky regions, potentially leading to an escalating financial crisis. Markets like reinsurance may be repricing rapidly, Carnegie’s Crawford says, but other elements of the financial system, like mortgages and credit ratings, may not yet have adequately taken these risks into account. “These places of concentrated risk may, as in the subprime mortgage crisis, be places of concentrated defaults,” she says. Unlike foreclosed condos in Las Vegas, however, the effects of climate change aren’t going to be reversed. Altogether, Crawford says 17 percent of the country’s $48 trillion housing market may be at serious risk of fire or flood, putting the national economy itself at peril. Just this week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 400,000 mortgages in the South are underinsured against flood risk. As a result, Crawford is advocating for major changes in how the National Flood Insurance Program considers future risks and strengthening the program by making flood insurance an opt-out element of obtaining a mortgage, broadening the pool of people paying in. She also recommends incorporating insurance costs into buyers’ mortgage eligibility, which Freddie Mac started doing last year. Government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac help stabilize the housing market by buying and guaranteeing mortgages. Privatizing them, as conservative advocates pushed for in Project 2025, could quickly change how climate risks are priced. Currently, neither enterprise directly accounts for regional differences in climate risk, effectively subsidizing credit in vulnerable areas. That’s in part because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have historically prioritized expanding housing opportunities. But privatization could lead to stricter lending standards in areas prone to disasters, like higher loan costs or more substantial down payments — making it cost more to get a mortgage in vulnerable places like California and Florida. Whatever happens to the country’s mortgage market, accurately pricing insurance may mean accepting that home values will decline as a result, Wharton’s Keys says. “The climate is just changing so much faster than policymakers are keeping up with,” Keys says, “and certainly than the pace at which the built environment can adapt.” Though many people in California live in unprotectable areas, a property value collapse there would likely have substantial effects on a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. “There are similar problems in Florida, Louisiana, coastal Carolinas,” Keys says, pointing to a December Senate report finding climate change is now driving a drop in insurance coverage nationwide, leading to higher prices. Any efforts to address these problems will have to balance short-term disaster relief with the unflinching reality that the climate risks are only going to grow. On Jan. 12, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) suspended the state’s environmental rules for rebuilding in the areas damaged by the L.A. wildfires to hasten reconstruction. But the move does nothing to address perpetuating unsafe land use practices or future climate hazards. “No matter what we do with emissions today, many of these changes are baked in,” Crawford says. Crawford grew up in Santa Monica, and even given her research into climate’s financial impacts, she was shocked to see that her childhood home was under an evacuation warning area during the L.A. fires. “Human beings are masters at self-deception,” she says wryly. “It is unthinkable that your neighborhood would go up in flames, that the place where you just walked your dog no longer exists.” But for Miller — who’s spending the shell-shocked days since losing her house trying to find a place for her family to live — and the other 180,000 people who were displaced in the fires, that unimaginable reality is here. Many of those who return to find their homes damaged but still standing are about to discover that their insurance won’t cover their repairs, says Dylan Schaffer, a partner at Oakland, California-based law firm Kerley Schaffer, which specializes in representing insured homeowners. Schaffer filed a class-action lawsuit last July against the FAIR Plan, alleging it has illegally limited coverage since 2012, denying thousands of families’ claims because it refused to pay for what administrators considered smoke damage. California law requires insurance companies to compensate property owners for “all loss by fire.” But Schaffer says the FAIR plan has been settling claims based on illegally restricted policies. In 2022, the California Department of Insurance itself concluded that FAIR plan policies weren’t meeting state requirements, identifying 418 violations of its insurance code where claims were improperly denied or coverage was impacted. In the two years since then, Schaffer says Lara hasn’t done anything to address the problem. Houses after fires are toxic, Schaffer explains: “Your neighbor’s house, with all its paint cans and televisions and toxins, burns down, and all that debris lands in your house, and the FAIR Plan’s position is, ‘We don’t cover this.’” Los Angeles was already facing a serious housing shortage. The city said in 2021 that it would need to add almost 500,000 units of housing stock, even before the fires wiped out thousands of structures. Without a functional insurance system to help people rebuild, the crisis will only deepen as displaced residents compete for a shrinking supply of affordable homes. “This is the point of the sword,” Schaffer says, “where climate change, economics, politics, and law all meet.” Though many of the houses lost in these fires were palatial — with values far exceeding the FAIR Plan’s $3 million coverage limits — historic Black and working-class neighborhoods were also destroyed. “Folks experiencing homelessness get lost in natural disaster,” says John Maceri, the CEO of the nonprofit The People Concern, an advocacy group working to help unhoused people find temporary housing and stay abreast of evacuation orders. Safe parking areas where people living in vehicles have access to restrooms have been burned out, he explains. Some of the people he helped this week find shelter off the street had been previously displaced by other catastrophic wildfires. Insurance, with its backstop of reinsurance, is a fragile scaffold on which lives are rebuilt, the mechanism that allows people to try to move forward and begin again. But while companies will eventually be spurred by bottom lines to account for climate risks, they are unlikely to consider equity in their response. That’s a problem, Crawford says, because “adaptation is a public good that won’t be adequately provided by the private sector.” While development prospectors may be drawn to cheap lots with a view of the Malibu hills, as homes become less insurable and services disappear, communities will weaken. In the scorched remains, property tax collection will crater, and municipalities won’t have the capital to rebuild infrastructure. It’s unclear how much even the houses still standing in neighborhoods like Altadena will be worth because of the destruction around them. Miller, for one, isn’t sure if she wants to come back to her burned-out home. She doesn’t ever want to be in that sort of situation again. Seeing the charred remains of the neighborhood she grew up in, “I’m homesick for the life I used to have,” she says, choking back tears. “I have to start all over.” We want to hear it.

Title: Snap, Meta Stocks Jump as TikTok Ban Approaches

Wall Street investors appear to be betting on Snapchat and Instagram benefiting from TikTok’s U.S. exile The stock price for Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, jumped 8.3% on Wednesday morning, while Meta’s share price increased 3.7% as both companies look set to benefit from TikTok’s looming ban from the U.S. Snap’s Wall Street surge pushed the company to $12.28 per share and a market cap of $20.5 billion. The Santa Monica-based company’s stock price has been on a roller coaster ride to start 2025, but following Wednesday’s early gains, Snap’s stock price is up 9.25% on the year. Meanwhile Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is trading at $616.29 per share and has a market cap of $638.4 billion. The stock jumps are likely tied to TikTok saying it would shut down its app this coming Sunday if a last-minute deal is not made to keep the app active in the States. ByteDance, The app’s Beijing-based parent company, is facing a Jan. 19 deadline to divest TikTok’s American assets. TikTok’s decision to shut down the app — which has 170 million monthly American users — goes one step further than the law, signed by President Biden last April, requires. The law bans new downloads from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play app store, and also makes it “unlawful” to update the app. In other words, existing users could keep the app on their phones, but it would never update. If TikTok turns off, Snapchat and Instagram would likely see a boost in users and usage. YouTube would also presumably benefit, and the stock price of Alphabet, its parent company, is up 2.3% on Wednesday. And Snap, in a timely effort to make it easier for users to find influencers on the platform, launched a “find your favorites on Snapchat” campaign on Wednesday. The law banning TikTok requires ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations to remain operating in States. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers say they have with TikTok is that it could double as a spyware app for the Chinese communist government; TikTok, per Chinese law, is required to share user data if asked to do so. In the days leading up to the ban, two Chinese social apps — Xiaohongshu and Lemon8, which is also run by ByteDance — have raced to the top of Apple’s App Store (You can read more about Lemon8 by clicking here). A potential TikTok ban has been lingering for several years now. Donald Trump first proposed removing the app from the U.S. during his first term in office before Congress ultimately passed the law banning the app last year. Despite his initial support, President-elect Trump has since changed his tune on banning TikTok, saying last year that he would like to “save” the app. And in December, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. The Supreme Court is currently weighing TikTok’s plea to overturn the law banning the app, but it does not appear likely before Sunday, when the app’s ban date hits.

The outgoing Biden administration is introducing even more measures focused on keeping advanced chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for artificial intelligence and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. “Advanced AI capabilities — facilitated by supercomputing, built on advanced semiconductors — present U.S. national security concerns because they can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of military decision making, planning, and logistics,” the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a statement. The new rules encourage chip producers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.37%), Samsung, and Intel (INTC+9.18%), to improve customer scrutiny and due diligence to prevent advanced technology from getting to Chinese customers, Bloomberg previously reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The measures follow the discovery of TSMC-made tech in a cutting-edge artificial intelligence chip developed by sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei in October. According to the BIS, the new rules improve reporting for transactions with new customers who could pose a risk of diverting semiconductor components to China. Earlier this week, the U.S. published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%), to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others. Meanwhile, the Netherlands released new rules aimed at Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML+0.68%). Under the new export controls, ASML must apply for licenses with the Dutch government rather than the U.S. government to export certain measuring and inspection tools. The rules will be effective starting on April 1. China-based Huawei and its chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), depended on ASML’s deep ultraviolet lithography machines to make advanced chips. However, the Dutch government restricted sales of this advanced tech to China last year, which has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment. China also cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make advanced chips designed by Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+0.54%).

Title: Better Capitalism Will Reduce The Need For Unions

EVERETT, WA - SEPTEMBER 06: Boeing machinist Scott Green, with his son Joshua, 3,on his shoulders, ... [+] walks the picket line outside Boeing's plant September 6, 2008 in Everett, Washington. Around 27,000 machinists are striking from the states of Washington State, Oregon and Kansas as Boeing faces its second major strike in three years. (Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images) One fascinating aspect of American business history is the pendulum-like swings in the attitudes of companies toward their employees, especially those who belong to (or wish they belonged to) unions. Every few decades or so, the pendulum seems to swing between hostility and collaboration, and the government tends to follow by increasing or decreasing regulations on the treatment of workers. The history of unions in America For instance, during the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, corporate owners had almost total freedom in their dealings with labor. Some spread the idea that most workers were lazy and didn’t deserve higher wages — an idea that justified strong resistance to unionization, by force if necessary. When the pendulum swung during the Progressive Era, reformers pushed the government to impose new rules that gave workers a better quality of life and a fairer chance at upward mobility. Unions began to gain more members and influence. As historian Heather Cox Richardson put it, “Prevailing opinion in the U.S. has seesawed between these two ideologies ever since.” She notes that from the end of World War I through the Roaring 20s, big business led a backlash against progressive regulations and a renewed trend toward laissez-faire capitalism. But with the Great Depression and FDR’s New Deal, most of America was again receptive to stricter business regulations and an improved social safety net for workers. The country became even more pro-union during the great post-World War II boom that lasted into the early 1970s. As Nicholas Kristof notes, “That was a magical period in American economic history, in which the economic pie grew rapidly and was also divided more fairly. Shareholders benefited, but so did workers, including African Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder.” Despite some corruption scandals and disruptive strikes during those decades, unions helped millions of workers join a broad and thriving middle class. As Kristof concludes: “Unions are as imperfect as capitalism itself, and just as essential.” The pendulum swung hard again in the early 1980s, when the Reagan administration promoted tax cuts, deregulation, and weaker protections for unions. As Richardson notes, “Those forty years, from 1981 to 2021, hollowed out the middle class as about $50 trillion moved from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%.” Private-sector union membership plunged from 29% in 1970 to about 6% today, contributing toward more extreme inequality. Kristof adds that “As unions declined over the past half-century, workers… were paid poorly, they lost health care and retirement benefits, and they lost control over their schedules. They were robbed of dignity and sometimes of wages as well. Deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol and suicide surged among blue-collar workers.” The prevailing corporate mindset in this era was “shareholder primacy” — the idea that management should focus on maximizing short-term profits and the stock price, and therefore offering unions anything better than market-standard wages and benefits was wasteful. In response, the prevailing union mindset was fiercely adversarial: us versus them. In the face of management hostility, why should labor care about any employer’s needs and priorities? Labor leaders won union elections by promising to drive hard bargains, threatening strikes despite any pleas from management about the challenges or hard times a company faced. Companies focusing on workers But now, slowly but surely, we see the pendulum starting to swing again. A new generation of corporate leaders increasingly recognize the downsides of shareholder primacy and the benefits of multi-stakeholder capitalism. Some companies are moving away from treating workers as replaceable widgets — as pure cost centers — and increasingly see them as the key to improving productivity and innovation, which are now the key drivers of long-term profit. Some notable examples in recent years include Delta Airlines, Home Depot, Costco, Best Buy, and JP Morgan Chase. One of my favorite examples is C.H.I Overhead Doors, a small Midwestern manufacturer of garage doors. The private equity giant KKR acquired it in 2015 and spent the next two years trying to win the trust and engagement of employees. KKR announced a stock ownership program that could give everyone a big payoff if results improved. They offered better training and began consulting workers on strategic decisions. They promised more trust and respect, in contrast to the old-school mindset of the previous owners. For a long time, C.H.I. employees didn’t believe any of these promises. But KKR kept at it, such as by polling everyone about how to improve the plant’s work environment and investing real money to implement the top suggestions (air conditioning and a better cafeteria). Over time, employee trust and engagement finally rose, and C.H.I was able to adopt the Japanese system of continuous improvement (kaizen). Workers became bolder about making suggestions and were rewarded for them. One major triumph was a new sequence for making and delivering garage doors, which cut the time from order to delivery so dramatically that no competitor could keep up, driving a significant boost to market share. Trust is key to a long term solution If a private equity firm (stereotyped as ruthless corporate raiders) can overcome employee skepticism and adversarial thinking, so can any company. The first move has to come from management to prove good intent. Talking the talk is easy, but only actions can establish an unwritten agreement, separate from any official union contract: if employees help increase the value of the enterprise, they are entitled to a significant share of the incremental new value. To help align everyone’s interests, management can adopt mechanisms such as restricted stock grants. PayPal used this to great effect. In response, unions need to accept that they will be better off if they work with management to make the company more successful — to make the pie bigger before lobbying for a bigger slice. They can refocus their approach from adversarial to collaborative, such as by offering new ideas to improve results. Unions can even offer to take a bigger role in strategic planning, to signal that they seek a voice in where the company is going, rather than merely waiting to execute directions from above. As we saw during the recent Boeing strike, not every labor conflict is primarily about wages and benefits. Boeing employees were furious that the C-suite had ignored their safety warnings until they escalated into fatal crashes. Had management trusted those with the clearest view of potential safety problems, hundreds of lives might have been saved — along with billions of dollars in penalties and lost revenue.

(Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images) I’m not naïve enough to think that every company is ready to embrace this pendulum swing. Last year the Economic Policy Institute found that more than 60 million non-union workers wished they had union representation, and the NLRB received more requests for union elections than they have in years. In response to this surge in labor organizing, EPI recognized that some companies, like Microsoft, New Flyer, and Ben & Jerry’s, were receptive to more positive labor relations. However, “Others have taken the opposite tack—to the extreme. Led by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and joined by Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Starbucks, these companies are engaged in a legal battle trying to have the NLRB declared unconstitutional…. Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Starbucks have stalled the bargaining process—an all-too-typical move by corporations when workers first organize.” Nevertheless, I can imagine a future without unions — not because they’ve been crushed out of existence but because they will eventually become unnecessary. As more and more companies discover the enormous value of treating workers as partners rather than as cost centers, workers will increasingly reject the “us or them" mindset as counterproductive. We’ll see far fewer ugly strikes, more win-win collaborations, and more value for all stakeholders. And in that golden future, perhaps the pendulum will finally stop swinging. One Community.

Title: our CEO is demanding we return to the office but people don’t want to — and I’m a manager stuck in the middle

A reader writes: In 2020, due to the pandemic, my entire company started to work from home. I enjoyed a much better work-life balance and know many others did too, especially because so many people moved further away for more space. Sadly, we’ve been asked to come back into the office. At first it was a loose mandate, so people did it sparsely. I co-lead our department of 13 people with my boss, and at first we were pretty chill about it. Then the CEO started wanting people in three days a week, minimum. This caused backlash among the departments. We decided to try two days to try to be in the middle. We thought it was working well and had it going for a year, but with other departments doing their own thing too it became a problem. Some did the three days, while some did just one day. Recently, the CEO — upon hearing Amazon mandated everyone back in-office — sent an email: “Come in Tuesday – Thursday.” So we’ve told everyone the time has come to really stick to it. And it’s been … not great. We had a meeting to say we understand this isn’t what people want, so in an attempt to be flexible — because some people have meetings with international regions, which make some days really bad to come in when they’re on calls from 8 am until noon — we’ll let people come in other days, as long as it’s three days. Well, that hasn’t really happened. Local staff are rarely doing three days. Some reasons are understandable: they’re sick and don’t want others to get sick, children-related, pet emergencies, etc. But it’s getting to a point where the CEO is going to feel we’re disrespecting his mandate, and boom it’ll be a mandate for five days. Our HR head is checking our key entries. We got a list last week. This is a constant hot topic in senior leadership. The old-school people think if we did five days a week in the office before, we should be able to do it again. Others, like me, feel it’s a step backwards to not see the benefits of flexibility or permanent WFH. Our jobs are very hard. I’ve never worked as hard as I’ve had to this past year, due to layoffs and terrible clients. It’s so demoralizing working until 11 pm sometimes and still be expected to be cheery the next morning in-office for the benefit of an out-of-touch CEO. He’s one of those “if I don’t see you working, are you working?” people. Plus, when we’re in the office, we all seclude to rooms for non-stop meetings. However, if I’m being honest, I do think some of our staff are too comfortable. Some don’t even show up in the office or give a reason. We feel a bit stuck. If we bring it up again, people will again spit out the reasons for opposing it. I do think some of those reasons are reasonable! And I also think some people are taking some advantage. I don’t want to care about this. Our team is built of highly functional workers. Many live so far that the commute is really bad (we do let people leave when they want so they can beat traffic). It’s really about tapping that key card for optics. And unfortunately there’s no “can you talk to people above again?” It’s been a discussion for three years now and in the end, what the CEO says goes. The answer is in your last sentence: in the end, this is the CEO’s call. As part of the senior management team, you can try to convince him that it’s in the company’s best interest to allow more work from home, but ultimately it’s his call — and it’s your job to be forthright with your team about that reality. I do think it’s worth coming to terms with what sound like some previous missteps. If the CEO wanted people in the office three days and your team compromised on two but even that wasn’t enforced and you’ve had employees not showing up at all and you thought some people were being too lax but you didn’t address it … well, it’s not surprising that your CEO is now responding with a firmer mandate. That’s not to say the CEO is right. For all I know, he might be; I don’t know your business or how hybrid work has played out there. And it’s possible it’s working for your team but affecting other employees in ways you don’t see (in particular, junior employees who are missing out on the learning by osmosis that happens when they share space with more experienced employees). But he certainly wouldn’t be the first CEO to cling to an old way of operating because that’s what he’s comfortable with, without recognizing that the workforce has changed, or that what technology makes possible has changed, or that what top talent in your field will demand has changed. And it makes sense to lay out for him your understanding of how a return-to-office mandate will affect the company’s operations. If you believe you’ll lose good people, struggle to hire the candidates you want, and generally be less effective as a result, you absolutely should present that case. But it sounds like you’ve done that, he’s heard you, and he’s still making a different call. Which he gets to do. If that’s the point you’re at, all you can do is to be very transparent with your team about the situation — about what’s being required, how much flexibility there is and isn’t, and the consequences if they flout that — and that it’s not about whether they’re right or not, but about what your company will and won’t allow. However, in order to do that, you need management above you to be clear about what consequences they’re truly prepared to enforce. If that conversation hasn’t been had yet, it needs to happen soon, so that you’re not managing blind. And who knows, maybe it’ll turn out that the CEO isn’t prepared to fire people who won’t comply, in which case you can decide whether you’re willing to just keep existing in a state of tension with him over it indefinitely and what that would mean for you/your team. But it sounds like it’s time to call the question: he wants everyone back in the office, people aren’t willing to do it … so now what? He needs to make that call, and then the answers for how you proceed will stem from that. Can we please have an update on this in six months to a year? I’m afraid the CEO will win and mandate back in the office for everyone. You will lose talented experienced workers and see a decline in productivity as you hire new less experienced replacements. FWIW: both my kids are WFH. They put in way more than 8 hours a day since the computer is right there and they keep working. I know this comment section will hate to hear it, but here goes. I’ve been working for 20+ years professionally. I’ve been in my current role for 7 years (but have worked at different companies). I am currently fully remote. I think there are DEFINITELY benefits to being in the office. Whether it needs to be 5 days is debatable. 2-3 though, I think is a good sweet spot. The fact that people are just flat out refusing to do so is done basically out of stubbornness most times, especially if they are local. In many fields, there are PLENTY of people out of work who are fine taking an in person role. And maybe the needs of the company and the employees are just at different places. The fact that you are framing this as the CEO “winning” is the wrong way to look at it. It seemed he tried to be pretty flexible with the 2-3 days, and people just flouted that. I’m not one to just follow blindly anything a CEO says. But I do think they have the authority to make those rules, and people can do it or leave. The benefits to being in the office depend on the details. This is where so many of these discussions fall apart, treating “work,” or at least white collar work, as if it were all the same. Yeah, that’s really the issue. So much of it depends on the nature of the work and the nature of the office. Long, long before the pandemic, my employer introduced a policy where you can work from home whenever you want, as long as you come into the office as and when needed. For people in my role, “as and when needed” ended up meaning 2 or 3 times a year, most often for just an hour or two. So yeah, automatically translating “sometimes it’s useful to be in the office” to “therefore everyone should be in the office 2-3 times a week” does not reflect reality. A good starting point is to look at what “as and when needed” actually looks like. the other hard part is “useful” can mean be useful to you, useful for your position, or useful to the organization more broadly. my job could be 100% remote but that is terrible for some discussions or for new employees or interns to get their footing for example The CEO is trying to define “Useful in that if I see someone at a desk (even if they are playing asteroids behind that spreadsheet screensaver) then I know they are working hard for my bottom line, but if I can’t see them they are probably goofing off: I have no other way to evaluate their work.” Which of course is unconvincing. Archivists, zoo keepers, plumbers, anyone who needs to physically intersect in space with another person: there are a lot of jobs that can’t be done remotely. But OP doesn’t seem to be in one of them, and so if management wants buy in, then it would help their case to not be declaring “But buggy whips! There was a time in this country our whole mission could have been making buggy whips, and we would make a profit, so why can’t we do that today?” Your formal notification that I will be stealing “But buggy whips!” as my shorthand for “lets cling to outdated technology and systems for as long as possible because I fear change”, henceforth. I am also calling Buggy Whips as the name when I start my all-women-steampunk-accordion-quartet. I read a few weeks ago that there is an expected pendulum swing of power back to managers. Not sure what that is going to encompass, but it might involve requiring more in office work and less WFH. People like WFH but bosses who are visually inclined feel slighted when there aren’t butts in seats. Yeah, when you have the majority of your people in-office but everyone is having meetings on Teams with people sitting right behind them, what are you even doing there? Or worse, I know people who are required go into the office to sit on Teams meetings with contractors doing work that has been outsourced to other countries. So you don’t even get the incidental benefit of running into your coworkers around the office. It’s especially demoralizing to realize the company is fine with people not being in person only when they’re outsourcing jobs. excellent points! That’s where my cynicism comes into play. Companies are paying for office space that is not being used, and they want to fill it back up. They don’t want to lose money on commercial real estate that is hard to unload right now (because of all the WFH). Aside from white collar work, I am seeing more and more small retail and restaurant businesses closing down. Entire shopping strips are empty. Yup that’s where I land too. They’re paying a ton for the office space, they want to see people using it. Even if it means they’re just taking zoom calls all day, aka working remotely from the office. This is more or less where I land, too. I don’t think I would want a fully remote role, so I appreciate the flexibility of going in once or twice throughout the week; and if something comes up during one of those in-office days, it’s not a catastrophe to my manager if I need to WFH instead. What I would also add is that I resent the fact that local leaders (at least here) lay this at our feet, instead of enacting policies or legislation that supports small businesses in town. Although I understand that COVID threw everyone in disarray, and we’re still picking up the pieces, it’s not my responsibility to prop up the local economy with a trip to the sandwich shop every day. And added to that, (in my corner of the world, at least) local leaders talk about the importance of people spending money downtown only in the context of requiring people to work in offices whether they need to or not. They’re not considering wages that keep pace with inflation (not even the wages of their own employees, where they could enact this policy with the stroke of a pen). They’re not considering doing anything about housing affordability. They’re not considering boosting social assistance rates. They’re not considering relieving student debt. They’re not considering affordable childcare. They’re not considering robust pensions. Not one single thing except requiring people to work in offices needlessly. And all THOSE things mean people are less able to or likely to spend money on a sandwich from a local cafe – they’ll pack their own to try and save money Yup. It’s not fun to pack food and haul a lunchbox back and forth. But you do what you gotta do. And they need to save money on lunch because they had to spend more money on their commute, whether it’s by car or transit This is the theory that this entire dreary argument is nothing more than a massive case of the sunk cost fallacy. There is a natural experiment already underway. Commercial office leases are long term, but they aren’t forever, and they don’t all end at once. Do companies’ attitude to WFH soften when their lease comes up for renewal and they have the opportunity to cuts costs? The extent that this happens tells us what was really going on, and also the extent to which the C-Suite does not understand logic. Of course this doesn’t apply to those big-name firms that built elaborate campuses back in the day. Those campuses will be an albatross for decades. My job just announced that we are letting go of some of our office space, presumably because our lease is up. This is great news for the majority of people who come in occasionally at best! My office is doing that too! We’re still hiring (2 to 3 people a month), still expanding *the work* but the physical office is shrinking by 40%. We used to have 4 whole floors of the building, after the remodel we will have 2 and a bit of a third floor. And we had record profits last year, too. my husband’s job who went officially fully remote, let go of 1/3 of physical office space, so it’s all mostly hotel desking for anyone wishing to come in …and now they announced back to the office mandate! x2 week if within 50km of the office Another conflating issue is that CEOs also often have investment in downtown real estate, and so stand to take a substantial loss if office culture truly dies for good. There’s some tangled incentives. My favourite is the companies that retooled their office space for a largely hybrid environment and are now demanding people come in even though there’s insufficient capacity to properly hotdesk. I know someone who was perched on a lunch table with no way to power their laptop Which is going to seriously impact the tax base for a lot of cities, since the valuation for taxes is based on what the property last sold for. I saw someone elsewhere theorize that cities are tying a certain amount of on-site presence to tax breaks in an attempt to drive traffic to downtown businesses. It’s the only argument I’ve seen that seems actually honest besides it just being CEOs all sharing the one brain cell. (So many of these businesses seem to be citing “everyone else is doing it” as their first and only reason.) In most places, property values are NOT based on the sale of an individual property, but on the median of a defined area over a statutory period. California is a notable exception. I’m in commercial real estate finance, and it varies from state to state. Some states, like Texas, are nondisclosure states where sales price isn’t public record. So it wouldn’t even be possible to set property taxes based on sales price there. That’s why there’s an entire industry built around appealing property taxes in Texas. Some other states, beyond just California, do set taxes based on the individual sales price (and others base them on aggregated prices over a set period, as you indicate). Whenever we get a deal in a state that we don’t work in often, one of the first things we have to do is to figure out how to underwrite taxes. But in any event, lower sales prices, whether on individual properties or as a market trend, will impact the tax base in many places. And lower market values will still impact the tax base in places that don’t directly consider sales prices. I think the office space of it is a thing. I have also seen many, many companies use this as an alternative to layoffs – you don’t have to file the paperwork that you are laying off a bunch of folks if they decide working in the office is untenable. But I also think that it is easier to create a company culture, onboard people, and keep people on the same page when you work together in space. It seems like for OPs job this might not be as good because they aren’t collaborating as much and there are big time zone difference, but in general… Onboarding remotely is rough. I’ve done it twice in the past (almost) five years. Some cultural norms, people, procedures, policies, etc., took me much longer to learn because I wasn’t on site. That being said, once it was clear that I was doing my job well, my boss was the one who suggested that I 99.9% telework (different than remote working for us). I’m on site today because I needed to have a discussion that took 25 minutes face-to-face. We needed to sit down together with documents, calendars, maps, etc. As much as I prefer teleworking, it’s not always the best approach to collaboration. We did one remote onboarding class and it didn’t go very well. So now our model is that you come onsite 100% for the first month of classroom, then follow the normal requirements beyond that. Shadowing used to be in-person only, but we figured out how to do that piece remotely and it’s been a definite positive! Yeah we make it that you need to be four days until you pass six-months probation and then you can make it three An awful lot of those places also sprang up in suburban areas though, too, with everyone WFH. But not every company is locked into their office space. My company was leasing their office space. After it was decided that we were staying fully remote, they talked to the landlord and got a sublet for the remainder of the lease and then didn’t renew the lease. They took the $500k they save each year on the office space and pay to bring us all together for a summit once a year where we basically get a free vacation so that we can spend time with our coworkers, especially the ones we don’t always get to talk to on a regular basis. Exactly this. There are days where it is to the benefit of my work that I be in the office; there are days where being in the office actively hinders my work. At my company, there are teams that all report in to one office and can collaborate in person; there are teams that have members spread throughout the country and collaborate through video calls. I’ve had team members who were caring for others and who needed to be flexible with their hours and put out amazing work from home; I’ve had teammates who struggled with this model and needed to come into the office. There is no one-size-fits-all. Appreciating the nuances is the way. Yes, our work can be done from a laptop and the really needed to be in person parts can be up to an hour from the office. It’s hard to schedule important business when we’re in the office for looks. When I started this job, working in the office was a punishment for a reason “The benefits to being in the office depend on the details. This is where so many of these discussions fall apart, treating “work,” or at least white collar work, as if it were all the same.” Seriously, even within the same company, it’s different for different departments and roles and individuals. It’s nuanced, and unfortunately, mandating X days in office is far easier than (a) identifying what is genuinely a business need that cannot be met with 100% WFH, and finding ways to achieve that while still affording people as much flexibility as possible; and (b) actually managing people as individuals who are either meeting or not meeting the particular requirements and expectations of their job, whether they are in-office every day or never. The thing that bugged me in my last job when back-to-office came up was: is anyone who wants to mandate in-office days actually going to do anything ensure these in-person days are worthwhile and accomplishing what you state are the goals of being in-office? I’m personally extremely pro-WFH, it works great for me, I’m more productive that way, etc. etc. BUT even I recognized that there were certain business needs at my previous job that were better served by in-person work. The problem was, no one was intentional about ensuring those in-person needs were being addressed on the days we went into the office. More often than not, in-office days felt identical to WFH days, the only difference being that we were all in the same room, and THAT is what is demoralizing about mandated in-office days to conscientious workers. Our senior management has been so tone-deaf about it. They’re talking about things like tacos and running into people in the elevator and bringing in treats! As if that’s why people choose to come into the office or not, and not things like weather and childcare and health concerns. This!! I am ferociously pro-WFH, but I also acknowledge there are certain things done better in person (training, team building, brainstorming, etc.). But does anyone actually ensure those things are happening in the office? Do people who take extra time to answer newbie/intern questions get rewarded, or do they have to make up that time later to get their “real” work done? Does management identify which departments need to work closely together and schedule their in-office days together? Does the office seating arrangement allow people to sit with their whole team, or are their not enough desks to go around? If I have to schlep to the office just to put on headphones and work on a computer, what is the point of being in the office? If the relationships I build over Slack are “good enough” and I’m not rewarded or recognized for doing more, why should I? Management needs to MANAGE, not just take away flexibility and assume things will follow suit. Can you imagine if they ran the rest of the business this way, they’d never make any money! +1. Our company has been dealing with something similar to LW for the last couple of years. We’re technically supposed to be in the office three days a week, but it’s never once been enforced and there are no consequences for people who choose to WFH almost exclusively. However, we have one team that is made up almost entirely of new graduates in their first jobs, and their managers do require them to be in office multiple times a week. It’s been great for them to learn from one another, take part in trainings, develop relationships with their managers and peers, etc. The teams with more experienced staff don’t have the same needs and thus less of a need to be in person as often. Its two ways as well – sure as an employee I enjoyed ditching the commute a couple of days a week and being able to focus on dep work at home but also the slackers on my team became far, far harder to manage. So as an enginer part of me is in camp ‘who cares where you do asynchronous work from’ but as a manager… ugh… can I just make the bottom 30% of performers come in? Per usual a few ruin it for everyone else. The thing is, you don’t have to be WFH to do bupkis – plenty of problem staff seem to be as adept at it whether butt in office or not! But for sure, WFH isn’t a great fit for everyone, even if “on paper” the job can be done just as well from a home rather than central office. Some people’s homes aren’t less distracting. Others may need the “organizational cues” or other external supports an office environment provides. It is certainly more than reasonable to make WFH contingent upon meeting whatever metrics of production, communication, and availability make sense for the position. I think that’s a tool managers really should have the resources and standing to use when needed. My employer makes it clear in the handbook they support hybrid and remote positions, but that under-performance is one of the grounds which a manager may use to reduce or eliminate remote hours. Same for flexing your hours. I knew who the slackers were in the Before Times, and they were all in the office. My old job started remote work years before the pandemic to save costs. One site was closed and everyone went remote or took severance. Our location moved to a smaller site and they wanted/needed to get roughly half the people to go remote or hybrid via desk sharing. One of the primary requirements was you could not be on a PIP, or responsible for child care/elder care, and had to be a good (or at least, above average) performer. Managing a team should definitely involve a lot more than checking to make sure people are there every day. OMG yes. Just because your job has benefits to RTO doesn’t make it universally true. I don’t mind going into the office. It’s a change of scenery, it’s comfortable and it forces me to exercise. Now that my work consolidated offices it’s less isolating as I actually see the odd person (previously I was going in once a week to hang out as one of a handful of staff in an office meant for two hundred) However, some weeks I do not have time to get my work done and go to the office. Literally none of my team is in my city. More than half aren’t even in the same time zone. We work together very effectively, but in office days cause project delays (because we have to wait for transit time), meetings are more frequently disrupted and quality of work is slightly less due to distractions. The mythical junior team member that would benefit from mentoring? Doesn’t exist. And anyway wouldn’t be in my city. There are other people in my building and maybe some are new to the workplace but I don’t know what they do or anything about their completely different projects. We don’t even work for the same client. Most folk in my city work for a variation of llama grooming while I’m painting teapots. Aside from our benefits plan and payroll being the same I’d have as much in common with a random person at a coffee shop. If this is what you want to pay me for, ok. But I find it enormously frustrating when the powers that be decree that we are doing RTO because it’s somehow “better” and are utterly unable to make any kind of coherent and relevant argument as to why. OP’s CEO sounds like could be mine, actually. My managers have been very much, this doesn’t make sense and we don’t see a strong reason to enforce except for CEO. Trying to be flexible makes staff feel like it’s not a completely serious ask. At my company many colleagues have said straight out that they don’t plan to comply until it’s strictly enforced. Some have plans to leave once enforced. I don’t get it. To me it’s like companies are struggling to adapt to our changing world. Yeah data shows hybrid being best for the majority of offices. It also depends a TON on what the work is. Working in nonprofits, we tend to have work that is high touch, and real-time collaboration and the social support that comes with in-office work is demonstrably tied to both our retention and the learning and growth of our employees. People doing tech support likely feel differently. But one is not inherently better or more evil than the other. Still, if these people don’t want to work in person, they might leave. And they’ll be replaced with people who are fine working in person. Less than 10% of jobs in the US are fully remote, most workers are on a spectrum from “tolerating in-person to work” to “preferring in-person work”. It’s fine to decide a certain office set up isn’t working, and sometimes the transition is tough but it typically works out. Yeah, but what happens where there are no remote-only jobs left? Because that’s where the CEO’s are going. It’s where SOME of them are going. Remote work trends started many years before COVID, the pandemic only accelerated the trend. The toothpaste is not going back in the tube. Remote only jobs will never disappear, because it and hybrid work makes a lot of sense for many jobs. Not just for employee morale but also for lower costs, greater flexibility, and reduced costs. Right. I was watching for that pendulum to swing back sooner than it did, but the tight white-collar labor market lasted longer than expected. Now, however, there’s little to stop the one-size-fits-all stupidity from being imposed again. (I give thanks to the non-stupid employers!) it also matters where the people are. My company is national and 90% of the people I work with are in another state. The only people local are a team that I’m a subject matter expert for so they get to interrupt higher value work and ask questions that can easily wait until end of day. Yeah – I think this OP honestly is just tired with the job overall and this feature of it has made managing really unpleasant. Where they might ultimately be happier working somewhere that has a more rigid in office mandate, or even in office 5 days a week, if their overall workload reduces and this tension doesn’t exist. My supervisor recently took a new job that has mandatory in-office I believe 4 days a week? She basically hated how unsupported our overall remote work structure was, particularly for her as a manager and didn’t like working so removed from people. And now she has a new job where that won’t be an issue. I have a friend physically relocating to a new state so she can be in-office at her current job more often because it’s what she wants for her career. Her employer didn’t make her, but was happy to help her financially because they agreed it would help her growth in the company. I think we hear a lot about the pro WFH people – and even folks like my former supervisor isn’t looking for a completely inflexible structure – but I think it’s shrunk the view on how many people actually prefer in office/near team work at least part of the time. For those of us who can do our jobs WFH, no one I know wants it to go away entirely. But I think that’s very different from the people who want the ability for full time WFH. Yeah, I’m very happy that my job literally can’t be done from home because I would absolutely hate it, both for productivity reasons (I’d be distracted by the countless stuff I could be doing at home) and for “psychological” reasons (I want my work and personal life to be as separated as possible which would be hard for me if my home were also my workspace). We exist! Totally. I run a relatively ‘young’ office (nobody over 45, and all staff but two of us are in their 20s-30s) and I am the only one who doesn’t prefer being mostly in office. This is me. My job has very little that can be done from home, but the job I was working at during the pandemic did (with some necessary alterations). I found out during the pandemic that I hated working from home and only connecting over Zoom. Even if my job could be done remotely, I would probably prefer coming in over not. I was probably the same amount of productive between WFH and in-office, I just hated not being able to “turn off” when it was time. My job (apart from a few months a year) could be done almost solely from home, but I come to the office almost every day, largely for the same reasons as you. As well as this, our office is in a space close to a lot of companies we collaborate with, and I like seeing people in person when the opportunity arises. Sometimes the meeting *can* be an email, but sometimes literally sitting with someone with a coffee and talking through a bunch of things is really good, and I’ve found that dynamic really hard to replicate remotely. Also, the commenters here are especially pro-WFH. Either that, ot the pro-wfm commenters here are just more outspoken about it than those who prefer working in-office. Hard to tell for sure! Personally I think hybrid is a really great option. My workplace has us come in two days a week, usually the same days a week but with some flexibility for other reasons. I think it’s really helpful to be able to connect with coworkers in person while also having the benefit of flexibility if you need it. I don’t necessarily want to go back to a full in-person work environment but I don’t want to go back to fully remote either, I think hybrid is a really great balance. This is me. Currently I live in the same city as a location of my employer, but the reality is that I’m the only person in my entire department who’s based in this city. So while I do go into the office occasionally – my work reality is that while my team has a lot of remote people – the city where there’s a concentrated group of colleagues isn’t where I am. I don’t always dislike the situation, but I also don’t love it. And while that alone wouldn’t be a reason to take or decline a new job – it’s not a situation I’d actively seek out. Going to a place with that set two or three days in the office sounds a lot more appealing to me, even if it would mean giving up some of the flexibility I currently have. I’m in the same boat (department in another city), and going in seems useless sometimes. Especially when it’s nasty outside like today. I’d just as soon stay home. It was the same with ExJob right after I moved, but then they switched me and the person who was doing the local stuff (she was remote), and it made a HUGE difference. When I started actually working with my in-person colleagues, I suddenly wanted to be in the office more often. I hope I get put on some things here, but I doubt that will happen since I’m only one of two people supporting the unit in the other city. Hi there, I’m the OP! It’s quite true that I’m very tired with the job overall, that seems to have been easy for people to pick up (even though that wasn’t the reason for writing the letter, heh). Though, just wanted to mention your specific comment that nope, even if I went somewhere where I really liked the work, I can honestly say I wouldn’t want to be in-office 5 days a week. When we went WFH during COVID, the freedom to use my time more efficiently for myself (like during lunch hours) and hyper-concentrate without distraction was so wonderful. When they mandated going back into the office and I started going in the 2 days, it wasn’t my ideal situation but after a while I got used to it. I felt 2 days was a good balance because I didn’t have to reset too much from my established routines. At 3 days, it’s robbing more than I would like. I get lonely being alone at home, single no kids, and one bedroom apartment. Instant messaging doesn’t replace human connection, I’m sorry. I don’t think it should be all 5 days in office, even before COVID my job let us have one day at home. But there needs to be a balance somewhere. If I didn’t do Toastmasters outside of work, I’d be completely lonely. Also I’m being laid off soon and looking for a job that is hybrid or in-office because of the loneliness. I’m single, with a kid and pets, and I vastly prefer to be in office. My work-life balance suffered so much working from home during COVID. I would agree. I prefer to be in the office some of the time. Being at home all the time isn’t good for me and I don’t work as well that way. Also the flat is really small and I feel so confined if I work from home more than 1-2 days. Covid was really hard for my mental health because in addition to working remotely all my usual social outlets were shut, no dances, no spas, no recreation and minimal shopping. I was so glad to get back to the office 2 days per week. I’m currently in a secondment role in the company I’ve been at for 7 years, and they offered to extend the secondment for another 9 months (been doing it nearly 2 years already, including a 1-year extension). I declined, partly because I’ve come to dislike the company’s setup of ‘work from home by default’. I’m normally in the office 3-4 days a week but the rest of my department are barely in once a month. Yes, I can talk to people in other departments, but only seeing my immediate colleagues 10 times a year isn’t great. Funnily enough, my original job at this company was literally impossible to do from home, which meant we were the only team in the company working in the office for about a year from March 2020, in an office which previously held about 300 people! As much as I’m not too keen on the work, the fact that I will see my colleagues every week (actually every day, but weekly would be fine) has tipped the balance in favour of going back to the original job when my secondment ends! A lot of that depends on the availability of reasonably priced childcare, though. I’m just the same! I haven’t had a kitchen table in five years because my computer and monitor is there. I’m currently looking for a job but the best part of my last job were my colleagues and working together with them. My ideal job would have flexibility to WFH a couple of times a week but I’d never want to be fully remote. It makes me miserable. The discussion about WFH vs Office isn’t about “balance”. It is about letting adults work in the environment that best fits the company’s needs and their needs. If the needs of the position don’t require being in office, then don’t force it. In your situation, it is about you finding a position in a company where the culture meets your needs. Wanting all employees to return to the office, even on a hybrid schedule, because it balances your need for socialization discounts all of the employees who are much more productive and effective WFH. People who need in-person socialization should not expect all those needs to be met at work. A person who needs that should find ways to get it outside of work. If not you’ll be a person like my boss, who puts her social needs first and is best friends with one of her direct reports. Not a good thing, for her or anyone else. I couldn’t agree more. I totally see how it’s more pleasant for some people to come into the office because they get to interact with other people. If that’s you, then go in as much as you want. No objections from me. Where I take issue with it is when that translates into me having to spend 90 minutes commuting and losing an hour of sleep each day I have to come in. Especially when I had a job where the project teams my colleagues and I worked with were spread out all over, so there were a million conference calls. Which would have had to happen at our cubicles. The distractions would have driven me to drink (and harmed my productivity). Anyway, it’s incumbent on all of us to figure out the level of social interaction we need to be happy and come up with our own plan to make sure we get it. I like the in-person socialization in the office! But it is utterly antithetical to the focused knowledge work that comprises my core duties. And I cannot switch between the two modes on the fly, not since long covid. I tried it for a year and it shredded my brain. Our org is pushing hard for 50% (which is hugely unpopular). The line I drew with my doctor is that I need a quiet, private environment in order to take calls, and my desk is… the exact opposite. Tomorrow is my meeting with HR to hash out the details and I am not looking forward to it. Good luck! I ended up getting a job where I have a lot more interaction with people, and that helped a lot. In the previous 25 years I had developed a social life outside of work, and that helps too. So I’m not like my boss. :) I think the point I was looking to make about there being a group of people who enjoy being in the office/more of the hybrid model isn’t to take away anything from those who prefer fulltime WFH. Rather it was to pushback that CEO’s/employers who change from a completely flexible WFH schedule are going to lose lots of talent AND won’t be able to replace them. I think it’s a false premise that right now everyone fussing about WFH is coming from the same place of not wanting to come in at all. A lot of people who dislike coming into the office don’t like it because none or few of their teammates are there – whereas a more rigid requirement would make those people happier coming in. Similarly, if one team has a very rigid approach and a team they work with doesn’t – the implementation feels unfair and that inevitably causes displeasure. The other point, is that there are people where this hybrid policy sounds great – and would be happy to apply for the positions of those who do leave. At some point this CEO is either going to make a more concrete decision that will significantly upset some and not others or will continue to operate in this middle space which will largely irritate more people and keep them in limbo. It’s funny, I have a completely different perspective on this. I feel more cut off from people spending the day alone in a grey box in the office than working alone at home. A few good mornings or nice weather exchanges with random people in the elevator or hallway aren’t enough payoff for the effort of commuting. Same. When I work in an office, the quasi-social interactions all felt really draining. I never expected or wanted my social needs to be met at work, but something about the “work in the office to connect with others” felt fake, forced, and unnecessary. Yeah, I spent the first 14 months of the pandemic living alone in a studio apartment. the loneliness was awful a lot of the time, especially in the winter when it was less pleasant to do things outdoors. Then I moved to a 1-bedroom apartment for a while, which helped because I wasn’t so cramped, but still wasn’t great. It wasn’t until I started dating my then-boyfriend that things started getting beter. Weirdly, I used to get lonely in my open-plan office. Everyone was trying to concentrate and there wasn’t any white noise, so 40 people could hear your whispered conversation or squeaky chair. It felt like everyone was looking at you but you couldn’t talk to anyone, all day, every day. The reason the extremely profitable company built the office open plan instead of with cubes or offices? “To encourage spontaneous collaboration.” I’m sorry but this is very ableist. Online friendships are very fulfilling and are human connections. Especially in an ongoing pandemic. Online friendships saved me when I was bedridden for a year bc of injury. I admit, my emotions are pretty raw right now, my online friend of 5 years died yesterday. At the same time, just bc you consider IMing not human connection doesn’t mean it’s that way for everyone; especially those in the disability community. WFH has been immensely important for accessibility and to have it torn away has been detrimental especially bc others only think face to face is socialization. I’m sorry you’ve been lonely and I do hope things get better for you. It was essentially Among Us that saved my sanity when I was bedridden for months from a major injury. No joke. The shift to online communications for work stuff during the earlier years of the pandemic is directly responsible for a work-friendship blossoming into my current closest friendship, period. (In fact, that person isn’t even a co-worker anymore, but the shift happened when they still were one.) Feedback I’ve given to my employer on surveys, etc., about work culture, hybrid/remote work, and related stuff has included reminding them that because of life circumstance, health, neurotype, and many other factors, the assumption that face-to-face interactions are the most effective and impactful is outdated and was probably never accurate in the first place. Folks who rise to leadership positions in companies tend to be those who are good at the face-to-face schmoozing stuff. Of course they tend to value that more, and assume that it is the superior way to connect to people, and that it is some objective truth of the world for everybody and every situation. I’ve noticed that many of those people are often lacking when it comes to written communication – they miss important details in emails sent to them, they have trouble asking and answering direct questions, and don’t know how to and/or want to use the tools available to them to refer to information they have already been provided in writing. And this is something that I’ve noticed starting well before I ever did any WFH work — I think a lot of it comes down to folks in leadership/management positions not really getting what the day to day work is like, and overly-relying on generalities and glossing over the details. That’s easier to do in a model where it’s talk talk talk, and harder to get away with when there is the possibility of detailed communications in writing that one can take their time to compose and refer back to indefinitely. For many of us, the divide became a lot more apparent when, for a time, there was a shift to more written communication for everyone. With all due respect, work is not your social life. It can be a part of it, sure, but wanting everyone to come into an office if it isn’t warranted for work just because you’re lonely is the wrong solution to your problem. I think you are putting words in the mouth of the person you’re replying to. right but if the rest of your department is just fine WFH, should they come in just to hang out with you? or maybe you need to build social circles outside of work and not use that as a crutch? ?!? have you tried hobbies? Community? Friends? Working at a coffee shop? It’s not healthy to rely solely on work for all of your social emotional needs. This is where I’m at TBH. And I’m kind of agreeing with this part too: “The old-school people think if we did five days a week in the office before, we should be able to do it again.” In the sense that like, yeah they’re not wrong? Not every job can be done remotely (at least not fully remotely) and people for the most part took those jobs knowing full well they were in-person roles with in-person expectations, and dealt with it. For years and years. So to be all “well how can we ever be expected to leave our houses????” now is a bit disingenuous, to me. And ultimately this is the CEO’s call so the OP and colleagues have to decide if this is a huge deal breaker I did 5 days in the office for 2.5 decades. Except it stretched me so thin that I was perpetually sick and would eventually have to take FMLA leave just to let my body recover. I have taken FMLA four different times at three different companies, and the medical reasons were all due to lack of sleep and lack of time to fully decompress from a stressfully hazardous commute (up to an hour each way) and 9-11 hours a day in an office building where I had to be “on” for every single one of those hours. Since COVID and WFH for the job I had at the time, and then taking a job that is remote, I haven’t had to take more than 2 or 3 sick days in almost 5 years, and I sure as heck haven’t taken any FMLA time off. So, yeah, some of us did it because it was the only way to get a paycheck, but it was highly detrimental to our physical and mental health. Exactly. I worked from an office for about fifteen years because that was the only option. Now that there are companies with other options, I take them! I’ve been fully remote for five years and I could not imagine having a commute and being “on” at an office all day ever again. I’m home sick right now. For the third time in two years, I’ve gotten a secondary infection after a cold. I’m sure I would be healthier if I didn’t have to commute to the office five days a week. Even though I like my job, I’m starting to wonder if I should look for something that’s remote or hybrid or at least has a better commute. Agreed. I had a similar schedule for 8 years (while having babies!) and it was exhausting. WFH has been a lifesaver. Same here. I took my first ever sick day at my current job (100% remote) after over two years working here, whilst at other jobs, I was out three or four times a year. One of my coworkers has a disability that our office building is not just not adapted for and which my employer refuses to update. (A years-long argument over whether a button-open door was necessary for our department door was only resolved when he was trapped inside the room during an unscheduled fire drill.) He still cannot use the elevator or reach the “handicap accessible” soap dispenser. Still, up until the COVID pandemic forced us all remote, he was never allowed to WFH as a reasonable accommodation. I’m concerned that these “return to office” pushes are going to screw over my coworker and others with less visible disabilities who have been able to work much more efficiently because they have the accommodations they need at home and don’t have to make a stressful commute (often dependent on an unreliable paratransit system or painful). This is me. I’m at a point where I need to WAH 99.9999% of the time if I’m going to work thanks to the confluence of several different disabilities. I was working effectively 100% remotely for several years before the pandemic and I am concerned about any future job search in this now hostile environment. As someone who works a job that is impossible to do from home, the way WFH people talk about it is a little grating lol. Agreed. Unless you’re at a specific exec level/positions – there’s no WFH for my industry. Which is fine as I chose this as my career and I like my work but the tantrums some people are throwing about a hybrid schedule are getting old. That sounds like “My job requires me to wade in raw sewage, so everyone should have to take a dip in sewage too.” If a job does not require you to be physically hands on, it should be open to hybrid or remote. This “Since my job is impossible to do from home no one should be allowed to work from home” crap is really petty and bucket crab-ish. If you don’t want to have to work on-site, but your field is one that requires it, then it is on you to change fields. It is NOT on others to take on wasteful commutes just to sit in an open-plan noise pit on Zoom all day just to make sure that they have it as bad as you do. Where did you get “My job requires me to wade in raw sewage” from “I chose this as my career and I like my work”? I can be silly and hyperbolic too. All of you complaining about not being able to work from home sound like you’re being asked to walk barefoot through broken glass every day. Get a grip. Pretend that said “sit” and not “sick”. My brain has not been working today. I’m not sure what people were promised when they started the jobs mentioned above, but a big issue is that if you sign up for a job expecting to be solely WFH or hybrid, and the rug gets pulled out from under you after years, it’s pretty normal to be upset. I’m not sure your industry or schedule, but imagine being hired and told you won’t work weekends/holidays/insert something else, until several years down the road and suddenly you’re told, “Eh, well actually, you need to work holidays/weekends/whatever after all.” Wouldn’t you feel at least a little upset, since that had not been the agreement when hired and you now have to give up something that you thought had been agreed upon when hired? That’s what’s happening with a lot of people. Also, as someone who currently works an industry where working from home is possible and fairly common, but at one point worked in an industry where it was not possible, I get not being able to work from home and having to drag yourself to a job when scheduled. On the other hand, my career was full of choices. I chose to make a shift in both industry and company specifically for the flexibility. I will also self-select out of jobs that never allow WFH (or where the pay is too low, or the PTO is awful) etc., etc. I could choose to work in an office that requires me to be in office 5 days a week, or an office with a higher pay but poor work life balance, but I choose not to. What I’m getting at is that ultimately, it’s all choices. If I still worked retail, or had chosen to be a police officer, ER physician, paramedic, whatever, it’s known that a position like that comes with crazy hours. It would be wild of me to complain about office workers for choosing to work a 9 to 5 when I had chosen a job with known crazy hours. Yes, this is a worker’s rights issue. It’s like starting a job and finding out you are expected to work longer hours or weekends with no extra pay. You’re just doing that commuting instead. “Impossible” work from home role was your choice. Funny how many people are being told “you must be present in the office” are also expected to also “and you must respond immediately at 3am to an emergency call and address the issue remotely”. Roles that “cannot” WFH have no part in this conversation. This is exactly why people who can’t WFH roll their eyes at these conversations. Comments like this. Also, it’s funny you assume that people who can’t work from home also must automatically work in an office and are never called at 3am to address issues. I made no such assumption, I pointed out that if we can work remotely when needed, then there’s no valid argument for must work in the office. If an ER Surgeon complain that he can’t work from home? Sorry dude, this isn’t your conversation. “I chose a must be in person role” people do not belong in this conversation. Retail is a thing, my friend. So what? That was your/their choice. Doesn’t mean you get to complain that those that can work from home are being told not to. And it’s also not my problem or role to go to an office just so your retail stand or restaurant can get more custom. Go on about how taking a retail job to pay my rent and then finding myself stuck here 5 years later, at least partially because of the pandemic, is a choice please. I actually really do feel for people who were originally promised remote/WFH when they began their jobs to now have that benefit being taken away from them, as I feel for every worker who loses benefits that they accepted in good faith when they took a job or when their job went remote. I also feel like sometimes people forget that there are still positions that can never be WFH/remote – and here’s the kicker – don’t respect them. As someone further down in this thread said, it does sometimes feel like this commentariat has lost sight of what kind of privilege they have, and it can sometimes make this difficult reading as someone who comes here (every day!) for advice on how to be a better leader in this field I may not have chosen but I still have an obligation to myself and my team to succeed in. you’re not wrong! I think people with jobs that are not suited or never were WFH should butt out of this chat. I don’t know what your job is but what if I told you that because most people have to work on their feet all day that you should stand all day even if your job didn’t require it and that you should stop complaining about having to stand? Or if they suddenly made you start traveling to other cities just to do your job for no reason? Thank you. I’m also in a job that can’t be done from home and don’t understand this perspective at all. You have your skill set and we have ours. Anyone that “can’t” work from home is out of their lane commenting on the thoughts or feelings of those that can. This is a very privileged commentariat on the whole and sometimes it is a bit of a trip, yeah. So? That’s the point – people that are affected by it are talking about it. If we could only ever talk at the level of the least privileged, nothing would ever be discussed. I’m not saying not to talk about it – I’m just saying that that’s often the only lens people are bringing to the conversation and it can sometimes make discussions very myopic. Personally I prefer to work in-office (I dislike working from home; I need to have separate spaces for work and home or I feel anxious that I should be working when I’m at home), but I disagree with “if we did it before, we should be able to do it again.” Just because a thing was always done doesn’t mean it should always be done that way. I entered the workforce over 20 years ago, and the Internet was definitely not set up for people in lots of fields to work from home back then. But now it is, and if we had any doubts, the pandemic proved that quite a lot of people can work successfully from home. It’s silly to not take advantage of those tools if it makes people’s quality of life better and productivity is not being lost, just because that’s how we did it before. That is, after all, how society progresses. If we all just did things the same way because tradition, we’d still be living in caves. Why bother moving out? Caves were good enough for our ancestors, after all. To be fair, I’d take a well-lit cave over the new construction apartment I currently live in (the windows don’t open). To your actual points, though, I agree completely. WFH makes me personally anxious and I’m glad to be back in an office (at least for now), but just because it’s been the norm doesn’t mean it can’t and shouldn’t ever change. In my field, WFH has proven to be much more efficient than in office work, which makes the return-to-office push seem particularly irrational. (My field also has a high percentage of open office workplaces. I do not think those are unrelated.) I’d be fine going back to the office if I had my own or a two-person office. I would start job searching if they wanted me to return to an open office. I hope to never work in one again. It’s weird to me that people chose to move far away during the temporary WFH we had due to the pandemic and then use that as a reason they can’t come to work in the office. many workplaces didn’t make it a temp WFH The “we did without it before” argument is thin. Offices did without computers in the past too; doesn’t mean going back to typewriters is a good idea. Exactly. We lived in caves in the past too. Given the productivity *gains* my field has seen from remote work, this is particularly apt. There’s a difference between being able to do something and it being a good idea, though. Like, people used to do research and fact-checking with library card catalogues and microfiche. I acknowledge there can be benefits to being in the office, but there are also drawbacks. As someone who is not a morning person, getting to sleep in makes a real difference to my quality of life. Sure, I was able to get to the office on time when I had to, but things are much nicer now that I don’t. I also have to take issue with your characterization of people expecting they should never have to leave their homes. I imagine you’re using hyperbole here on purpose, but I don’t think that kind of thing helps us to have this conversation. I’m very much against mandating X days a week in the office for my job and similar jobs. But I will go in when there’s a good reason for it, and I have done so, even when it wasn’t technically mandatory. If you do a thing for decades, then circumstances force you to discover that actually, there is another way to do things after all, going back to “We did it before, we should be able to do it again” isn’t automatically right; what it IS, is refusing to take new data into consideration. Some jobs absolutely are better in offices (I think a lot of parts of mine are, for example; for one, the unexpected phone calls are usually some of the most time and person critical bits). But not all (my husband likes to go in several times a week but can work from home, which helps when we have sick children, or he’s feeling a bit off but can work). One would hope those who have to decide will use discernment and actual data, not tradition. We *can* go back to 5 days a week in the office. Obviously it’s possible for many people. But why, if remote work makes for a better work experience? I can wash my clothes by hand, but the washing machine makes it a better experience. Having worked in person for the majority of my 30 years working, yes, I can go back to commuting every day. I’m all for providing office space for those who prefer it. I prefer business on top, party on bottom outfits and my bedroom-to-office commute. The old-school people think if we did five days a week in the office before, we should be able to do it again. The difference isn’t that it became physically impossible, though. The difference is that whether it could be done was tested, and based on the results different assumptions about what is possible have now taken root. People who correctly believe that they have options and want more work from home than is offered will go somewhere that offers them that. I’m kind of a hypocrite when it comes WFH – I’ve been remote sine 2016, and with about a year until I retire, I’m not going back. But I look back to the earliest days of my career and I agree with how much I benefited from learning through osmosis. I learned so, so much about how the company functions, what different departments do, where to find answers to process/procedural questions, and on and on. I really don’t think I would have been as successful in my career if I’d been working from home all along. I would have been completely lost and unaware of anything beyond my specific job. See, my previous career was very in-person and hands on – environmental chemistry. When I was working in a lab, I had to be there to run the machines. When I changed careers, I changed to one that wasn’t hands-on physical, because of my disability. If I were still doing lab work, of course I’d be going in to the lab. But now, all of the equipment I work with is in data centers around the world, and I don’t need to sit at an office desk to log in and issue commands, so I can work remotely. Why people insist that “if they do a thing, you have to do the same thing to make it ‘fair’ or some such BS” I really don’t know. Taking cars off the road by having remote capable jobs actually be remote is a good thing, IMO. For disabled folks like me, remote work means that I have spoons available for caregiving too. I just wanted to say that I’ve enjoyed reading your comments on this. I’m glad others are bringing up disability. It’s an important aspect in wfh discussions that often gets forgotten about except by those of us who it affects. It’s funny how I see this play out personally. I am a professor – I work in office, commute time of 1 hr one way, any day I have class (all 5 weekdays this semester) plus occasional weekend duties. I have family members who are: 1) hybrid, engineer, can be super flexible as long as he’s working, and regularly travels while working 2) hybrid, engineer, who works out of the office because home is terrible 3) in person, scientist, needs to do lab work, but will write from home 4) fully remote, data scientist, who quit a previous job due to bad boss + RTO mandate. Works with people all across the nation, but has a flexible schedule. In person meetings 2-3 times a year, paid for by the company 5) hybrid, tech support, who drives to an office to sit on the phone/computer without actually seeing anyone who are all also on phone/computer 6) there are more, but that’s enough Some of these make sense, some don’t, based on the type of work they’re doing. (5) could definitely work from home, but the building must be used. (4) didn’t even have an office to go back to despite the RTO push that was turning into a mess, and that was a hard deal-breaker, because they were so much more productive without chatty coworkers around. I could teach from home, but in-person classes are so much more effective with my community. There’s so much variation in workplace, work subject, and workers, that a blanket “one is better than the other” is just not possible. Although, I’d appreciate it if more people worked from home so they didn’t clog up my commute, just saying. I really do think 3 days in the office is the ideal balance in basically every situation Even if you’re only going to the office to be on the phone? Or if you teach classes 5 days a week? Or if there never was an office to begin with and the top experts are scattered across the country? I think it still varies depending on what you’re doing. Why? I mean, my immediate team is spread out over 3 cities that are each 4+ hours away from each other. There was a past letter from someone who worked remotely supporting the Wichita team, but the new mandate was that she couldn’t do that from home, but must come in and sit alone in an office in Connecticut, supporting them remotely from there. Where she didn’t actually talk to anyone, but if you checked the key fobs then her butt was in a seat in a specific building in Connecticut. My team is spread across the planet. The engineers and test teams are in Taiwan, the program manager is in Bangalore. My management is all in a city three hours from where I live. I’ve never met anyone on my team in person. Not one person. We do almost all our communication via electronic means that didn’t exist 15 years ago: Teams, Slack, occasional Zoom meeting, and good old-fashioned email (a notable exception). Even the phone calls are though our computers. I am great at my job, and working from home suits my personality and work habits really well. Even if I had an office to go to, I’d be getting up every morning, making myself presentable, and driving a car to another place where I’d sit all day doing *exactly* what I do in my home office wearing my flannel PJ’s. My company gets a lot more work out of me by keeping me a remote worker. There just isn’t much that applies to every situation these days. Our office is 400 miles away from where I live (and this was true when I was hired; I didn’t move away from commuting distance). Every member of my team lives in a different state. Yeah, right now people are supposed to be in the office three days a week due to the CEO’s decision and THEY JUST AREN’T GOING AND AREN’T EVEN GIVING A REASON WHY. I can’t fathom that these people don’t expect to lose their jobs any minute. Except most of them are giving reasons why. My advice would have been for the manager to manage, and address those people directly, and point out why this is a way to lose all WFH privileges. The employees are not a monolith, they are individuals, and she can speak to the individuals causing the problems. I think they expect to not lose their jobs because they didn’t lose their jobs any of the other times the CEO announced that. Possibly they are right. Possibly the people doing this are concentrated amongst the difficult you’d just as soon see remove themselves. Possibly the people doing this are concentrated amongst the ones who correctly believe they are too valuable to casually lose, and ignoring the rule will continue to work. It’s not like “Yeah, that’s the rule on paper, and we all just ignore it and follow the rule in practice” is a new thing for people dealing with bureaucracy. It sounds like the potential consequences haven’t been outlined; if there’s usually a progressive discipline process (warnings, PIP, etc) then people probably think that will come before being fired. It also sounds like consequences haven’t been enforced in the past, so it’s hard to tell how much this issue actually matters to management. It’s also possible that some of those people are ready to leave over the return to office requirement and prefer to be let go rather than quit. The benefits of being in the office depends heavily on the type of work you do. Additionally, while there could be some benefits to being in the office, there are also benefits to working remotely as well. If you think being in office is so crucial I am curious as to why you haven’t sought out that type of job and leave the remote positions to people who prefer it more? You are really conflating your own experience with the One Right Way. Most people want telework “out of stubbornness”? How about most people want telework to save themselves 5-10 hours of commuting every week and be better able to deal with family emergencies, just to name a couple. Try on some other people’s shoes. I’m going to have to go back in probably 5 days a week starting soon, and it’s going to cost me a couple hundred dollars a month for parking. I don’t think most people want telework out of stubbornness, but I do think many people who want telework stubbornly believe any choice a company makes outside of allowing 100% remote work is a bad choice made by incompetent people. Removing WFH for people when in-office work isn’t a clear requirement to successfully do the job is the equivalent of giving them a pay cut where none of that money goes back to the employer. If my company made me return, I’d have to pay for parking, gas, more car maintenance, and childcare after school (my kids are old enough to manage themselves after school while I work but too young to be left home alone). I’d also lose 2 hours of sleep a day and a bunch of time with family and have to rearrange my entire life. I can take 20 minutes off to pick kids up after school, but if I were in the office, I’d have to leave work for 1.5 hours to get them because of the commute. Not to mention trying to figure out how to get the kids to school on time and not be late for work. I’ve seen a lot of reasons here why forcing people to change a schedule they’ve been doing for years is unfair, but none about how it affects millions of working parents, especially working mothers. The back-to-office trend is bad for women. I hear you. I hit retirement age at the end of pandemic related work from home. It was the only 2 years on my 50+ working years I’d ever been remote. I *loved* working from home, and was able to retire without ever having to go back. But….I was a senior level consultant and when in the office, I was a resource for 60+ people informally in addition to the specific teams I serviced. All that day to day information sharing was lost. So from a corporate POV, having me WFH was a loss to their educational process. It showed me that people won’t pick up the phone or email as much as they will lean over a cube wall for a quick question. So the push me-pull you of this will be corporate needs vs the desire of staff to avoid commuting and being able to get their laundry done. Totally agree. It’s time to fire the workers and bring in people who actually want the job. In my last job we worked two days a week in office. Then my husband was tranferred 800 miles away and I worked from home for 7 years. I was very grateful that I didn’t have to find another job but there is a downside. I missed out on a lot of knowledge and social interaction. I agree with you, I enjoyed my time working from home, but like Allison said, there are benefits to working around other people — it makes collaboration and cross-training significantly easier (like Allison said, the “learning osmosis”). And I do think in-person conversation can lead to insights that Zoom/Teams ones just don’t. My team and I each work 1 day/week from home, which I think is fine 2-3 days/week in office and at home seems perfect actually. The research agrees that for most people and most jobs 2-4 days in the office results in the most happiness and productivity BUT that’s a broad stroke. The optimum balance for individuals and businesses is going to vary widely depending on age, job, position, etc. Of course he will win. He is the CEO. We have a similar discussion at the moment and had I known the strict rules for office days they want to implement now, I would not have chosen this employer two years ago. And I am definitely in favour of working in the office. But I am under no illusion that the CEO cares about that. Of course he will win. He is the CEO. Well, TBD. We had six (that I know of) businesses fold in my hometown of ~35M (35,000) people over the past 4 years, explicitly citing “not able to get enough good/dependable/reliable/productive workers onsite.” If enough people vote with their feet, the CEO could well end up with no one to give orders to (or less than the quorum needed to conduct business). How is this a win for anyone exactly? Your town had 6 businesses close which means what, they moved elsewhere or shut down entirely? That is not great for the town revenue nor is it good in the long haul. Finding a happy medium would be good for everyone. One of the little secrets of remote work is that the business doesn’t have to be in the town for the town to thrive. Corporate taxes aren’t generally municipal, and if the *workers* are still in town, they’re still frequenting local businesses and paying taxes, probably more than if they had to drive to the next town over. Less driving means less damage to roads and less congestion. If businesses are shutting down because all the local workers are both happy to and able to work remote, it’s not a problem for the town at all. My point is that the businesses themselves have to pay taxes and those revenues are much higher than what residents pay. Things that benefit everyone. This is why cities and towns want to bring in a business. I just claimed the CEO may be playing a losing move, and cited recent experience of examples where it (may have) played out that way. Just because the CEO loses doesn’t mean someone else necessarily wins. One of the businesses was a bakery, but the other 5 were white collar/knowledge work. Nobody said this is a win for anyone. Just that it wasn’t a win for the CEO. It’s wild to me that these leaders decided to keep pushing forward with requiring people to be on-site and shut down (or move) than just be more flexible on that requirement. Seems like more evidence that this strong preference some leaders have isn’t based on data or logic. This happened at my partners company. They mandated 3 days/week gave people 6 month notice and then made it 4 days about 6 months later. Why? People were not following 3 days and their managers didnt do anything about it. IT went into the system and used the data and showed people weren’t working/being productive at home and not working when they said they were. To OP, they can see a lot more than your card swipes! I always eye roll when people say this. If your system or laptop is owned by your company they can access that. They can tell if you use a mouse mover, etc. Also more and more companies are checking to see if you’re unavailable certain times of the day. Kid emergencies, occasionally, fine, but if you pick your kid up and send a couple emails from 3-5 and call it a day that isn’t okay to do. If your employees aren’t listening to the mandates then how do you even know if they are doing their work? I had one team member tell me they worked 8 hours and did X work. Well, they didn’t work 8 hours, but what they got done in that time period pre-covid someone got done in 1-2 hours max. More and more companies are RTO and those who let people work remote are monitoring their employees more. Honestly, I work with clients and the ones who are remote are usually the harder ones to get in contact/get a response from. I don’t want to generalize, but that is usually the issue. “how do you even know if they are doing their work?” I dunno. Are they meeting their goals or not? That is, how do you know if someone is doing her work when she is in the office? Yup. So many of these discussions come down to management having no clue how to measure productivity, and using face time as a proxy. THIS. Exactly. Too many managers (and CEOs) are lazy and incapable of managing by results, so they just manage by presence. Their employees, and ultimately their companies, pay the price. I am perfectly capable of being a flake in the office if I’m mentally checked out. I also used to have a coworker who would come and yak at several of us, screwing up our ability to get anything done Exactly. When I worked full-time in office you could still browse the internet, stare at your desk, go for long walks, chat with coworkers and other things that weren’t productive. You don’t always have a babysitter in the office who keeps a watch over everyone. Usually managers have actual work to do and can’t observe everyone all day. I got really good at listening to podcasts while pretending to read documents. This is why I’m way more productive at home. I do like the interaction in our office, but it’s really easy to get bogged down in conversations with coworkers on a daily basis. I probably lose at least an hour every time I’m in the office because we’re a chatty bunch. If I have a heavy workload and/or tight deadlines (which happens more often than not), buckling down at home without any distractions is the only way I’m making progress. I think if you had IT look at everyone’s computer usage when they are in the office too, that they’ll also see a lot of gaps, too much internet time, etc. If they didn’t look at that before, I don’t know that looking at the home use is a good comparison. Also, we all have productivity dips and spikes, and there are sometimes slower periods where your job is mainly to be “available”. You’re still plenty available if you take 10 minutes here and there to check the laundry. Personally, I think my productivity is similar either way. I waste more time “people-ing” in the office vs. fitting in some chores at home. I probably have more energy at home, because I get an extra half hour of sleep because no commute, and because it’s easier to walk out the door for a 2 minute sunshine break when I need a pick-me-up vs. taking the elevator down multiple floors at the office. Also, my bathroom is closer at home, lol. And at home, I’m more willing to ride a high productivity spike as far as it goes, even if that takes me past bedtime. I’m not always comfortable staying at an office that late. A lot of companies can really make remote or hybrid work, but every company is subject to the desires of leadership, so that kind of is what it is. If OP wants to retain any WFH flexibility at all for their team, they are going to HAVE to enforce in office days. I’m physically at work and just had to escape my coworker who likes to drop by and talk at me for as long as possible. He complains that management wants him to come to work when he’s perfectly fine working at home, yet doesn’t seem to clue in that we can all notice that he isn’t doing work when he’s here (I also have the impression he’s on a PIP, so he’s really clueless). I’m at the office today and the hourly trainers are just chatting. Us salaried workers are heads down. This is why my boss’s go to responses when someone comes to IT to find out productivity is to tell them to be a manager and set goals. Way too often we have managers ask for teams status logs, which we don’t have because in our organization that would be way too much data. Sometimes we have managers ask for something to prove their employees aren’t working but already have more than enough evidence. Like Susan, your employee has multiple complaints of being unresponsive, the work output is nonexistent, you told us the employee sounds asleep when you call him. Be a freaking manager and go to HR to start the term process instead of being mad we don’t have a webcam tracker system. Many people’s work is NOT just sit at computer move mouse – even on days when I don’t have classes, I have calls (no mouse movement usually), conversations with other people, walking to the printer, doing stuff on paper (I plan and sometimes edit on paper), walking to other parts of the campus, in the library, in a meeting room… at least half of an in office day is NOT on a computer at all, and a good chunk of wfh days are still not moving mouse clicking keyboard type work. Thinking for a start does not always involve clicking anything (unless I am playing solitaire whilst thinking…) My job is literally ‘open email, write down email subject, make sure email has been filed, move email to ‘done’ folder, rinse and repeat’ and I still have to interact with people. Staring at the computer screen trying to figure out how to solve the problem it is displaying, without moving the mouse. In this case, too, the LW IS the manager, who could do the managing to make sure they don’t get a stricter mandate — by calling out the people who aren’t working or aren’t giving any reason for not showing up. By checking in, and collecting productivity data herself. If she can prove Joaquin and Anya are successful wherever they work, and Chris’s productivity numbers are actually lower In Office, but Wakeen’s numbers are noticeably lower at home, and Izzy rarely comes to the office and is impossible to reach after 3 PM, she can address the real problem. If your employees aren’t listening to the mandates then how do you even know if they are doing their work? I’ve freelanced remotely since the 90s, and it is just wild to me that some earnestly believe that there is no way a boss could tell whether or not I was doing the work project they had contracted with me for other than by checking how often my mouse moved. I have to show progress and give updates! I think the point was that this LW does not seem to be managing well, whether in-office or not. They’ve thrown up their hands about RTO, is it likely they have established goals and metrics to measure production? Maybe, but it’s worth asking. LW here! Yeah my concerns are nothing about, “Is our staff being productive?” They’re all doing exactly what they need to be doing! It’s literally just about appearing in the office because we’re concerned 3 days turning into 5 days. I also forgot to mention half the team is local, half the team is remote (in large part because either people were hired during COVID or people moved during COVID to other states). So there’s that pickle too. I feel that “lose talented experienced workers” is a wonderful fantasy, but won’t happen. My company is 3 days in office (not respected by all people), and will probably be 5 days in-office by the end of the year. I’d be surprised if as many as 10% of people left. We’re a niche industry (certain type of engineering), and …. there just aren’t that many places to pivot to. I also agree with L-squared that 2-3 days in office is good for actually meeting people in person, and as Alison pointed out, for training junior people, or people new to the company. Slack/teams doesn’t fill the same role. When the CEO at my last job changed the definition of hybrid from “2-3 days a week, based on the needs of your department” to “Mon-Thu, no exceptions; if you have to be home for even a few hours during those days (to let a repair person in, for instance), then you have to use PTO because we also aren’t doing flextime anymore,” my department of 15 people lost 5 of those people. I was one of the five. In the 1.5 years since, another 3 of the original 15 left. Yes, the department has been able to replace them with people who are fine with 4 rigid days in the office, but the 8 they lost were the senior-most people with the most knowledge. So they lost half of an entire department because of the RTO mandate, which cost the company money to recruit, money to pay the new people (always at least a little bit higher than the ones who left), and productivity lost while the new people gain the knowledge and skills that the ones who left had (which takes years). And that was just *my* department. The same thing unfolded companywide. If they replaced senior people with junior people, they did not pay higher. That may have been the plan. My last employer had over a decade of ‘WF Anywhere’. I started WFH in 2007 (my ‘team’ was in Europe and Mexico, I am in the US, so where I worked didn’t matter), and the ‘back to the office’ edict came in 2017. Everyone had 12 months to arrange to work at a local hub, and they were closing smaller locations. So, for example, people who had been working in Charlotte NC had to go to RTP (2hrs away) to work at least 3 days / week. People who’d moved to FL or coastal regions preparing for retirement were expected to be back in one of the central offices. This impacted older employees much more than younger ones. The company planned it to gain cover for firing older workers. The class action lawsuits are still playing out, but it’s now mostly about whether separation agreements can really be used to stop people from suing when companies break the law, not about whether the company broke the law. I saw the company use this and other tools to force early retirements. Why pay a supply chain team lead $150K when you could hire a new one for $110K? Programmers / engineers / sales were a little cushioned from this by demand and relationships, but for back office functions, new people were much less expensive. (yes, the company is probably obvious to people who pay attention, but I may be legally required to not mention the name. I got laid off 10 months ago due to closing down manufacturing, but I’m in a position that I like better and they were at least reasonably generous, so no hard feelings on my behalf. On behalf of that $150K team lead tho – he was the best manager I *ever* had, in 30 years working for multiple companies, and the replacement… was not. Salty about that one.) This was my biggest fear in applying for jobs posted as “hybrid.” Other than the fact that some were not actually hybrid at all, I had heard tell of many companies offering a position as hybrid and then pulling the rug out from the employees and mandating RTO. At the very least, if this had happened to me, I’d be looking. If it were a discipline/work productivity issue where someone said, “Okay, we can see you aren’t actually doing anything at home and are disappearing all day, so we need you to RTO” that’s one thing. If the CEO developed a butts in seats attitude suddenly and switched gears for no real reason rooted in logic, I’d be less than pleased, particularly if it were in certain areas. There are certain jobs I wouldn’t mind commuting to for 2-3 days a week, but not a full 5. My friend’s company recently announced RTO. They had a 300% increase in resignations within the first month (before the RTO even took effect). HAHA. I’ve been working from home for more than a decade. I’m a pretty valuable employee and highly compensated for it. ilIf there was ever a return to office mandate I’d be out within a week working for our competitors. Studies Joe that it returned to office mandate typically results in 15 to 20% turnover but that turnover is skewed highly towards the best performers leaving the company. Random data point: was on the JP Morgan Chase earnings call today. When someone asked about efficiency/cost cutting, they mentioned having clearly overhired during covid and needing to seek “efficiency” there. They also made waves about RTO. People are framing the JPM RTO as a nefarious control tactic and lazy way to do a layoff. In reality, it’s more a case where the “spreadsheet” and “backoffice” work that is easy to do from anywhere is getting streamlined and automated, and the company now needs/prioritizes (mid level and senior) people who can solve their more urgent problems, such as how to deploy all of their capital. Those things usually require meetings/brainstorming sessions I’ve been working from home since 2020 with 1 day onsite since 2023, and I’ve had meetings and brainstorming sessions this whole time. You assume that “talented, experienced workers” want to work from home and would oppose more office work. This is certainly untrue in many cases. I am not opposed to 1-2 days of work from home per week, but the idea that you’re going to permanently atomize your workforce and never interact with another human is an AAM fetish, bit reality. *not reality Working from home and “never interacting with another human” are two completely different things. I WFH and interact with my coworkers all day long. Interacting via Teams rather than in-person has no effect on the work I do, other than I get much more done because I don’t have to commute and I’m not interrupted constantly by idle chatter. As the father of two teens, my observation is that they are perfectly happy with their social lives being largely, or even entirely, virtual. It’s not for me, but I’m an old. They are — and data is increasingly showing that this is a big concern, socially and educationally! You might want to read up on that. I haven’t dug too far into this, but it looks like the data is a lot more nuanced than just “online-only interaction bad for teens”. The *type* of interaction seems to matter a great deal. Scrolling through social media seems to be particularly problematic; texting or video chatting with friends, commenting in online communities and similar tend to be much better for teens. Since my stroke in 1995, a large part of my social interaction has been virtual, often by text only, without cameras or voice. The concept that you can’t have a social life without being physically colocated does not match with my reality at all. Same. Not stroke but injury that caused disability. I’ve had online friendships that are still going strong 15 years later. I’ve preferred to deal with people virtually (good old email!) for nearly all aspects of work whenever it is possible, because I can listen and understand better, am less distracted, and just more comfortable and feel more competent all round. Found out last year, aged 55, that I’m AuDHD which probably explains a lot of it, but I’m also an introvert. Nuance is really important – people have different needs, and both companies and roles have different needs, expectations and mores around whether it is acceptable, expected or a problem to chat, have music on, drop in on people, take long coffee breaks which have a little work in them and call them a meeting, expect people to spend substantial chunks of time travelling around buildings or a campus for different meetings regardless of their role etc. It is absolutely true that WFH is not the same as being in the same physical environment. We operate differently online vs in person, and we learn about each other and our work differently. It is infuriating when the AAM commentariat pretend that they’re equivalent — it does this topic a huge disservice! Why can’t we be truthful about the differences without espousing a judgment about which one is better? I am fully remote (my entire org is), but we have a healthy budget for team retreats and an org-wide retreat. I could not be successful working from home if I didn’t have that 5x/year in-person time. You might deny that, but I would genuinely have trouble believing you. I’ve been in my current, 100% remote role for two years. I have never met any of my coworkers in person. I haven’t had a problem getting to know people. I would call meeting 5 times a year fully remote. I have worked fully remote for 5 years. In that time, I have met some of my coworkers in person and others I haven’t. I have the closest working relationships with the coworkers who I work with frequently, engage in some non-work conversation with, and I either see often in person *or* turn on their cameras. Honestly, the only major difference for me between a video conversation and an in-person conversation is finding out how tall the other person is. My coworkers are in other cities being forced to go to offices there while I’m forced to go to the one in my city. I have never met any of them in person and likely never will. Studies are showing that RTO mandates are driving higher turnover, usually of better performing employees (and no, I’m not monkey, I’ve just seen the same studies). It’s not universal, but the true best way is to be as flexible as you can within the needs of the business. A lot of commenters make it clear that they are in contact with their coworkers whether in person or remote, through Zoom/Teams. Might your job be creating a specific bias in your head about what remote work looks like? I am of the same opinion as you — I would not like a job where it was 100% WFH, however, if I had applied for a job that offered 1-2 days a week of WFH and suddenly that was rescinded, I’d be pretty peeved and probably looking for a new job. Hm seems like your kids need to enforce some work boundaries I doubt he’ll lose talent. The job market is terrible and especially for remote roles. I applied to an internal job and was rejected without interview a month later. Since it was internal they gave me feedback when I asked. The feedback was “You are great and I would have hired you if I had seen your resume… but we got over 2,000 applications on the first day. HR sent me a hundred qualified applicants by the end of day 2 and I only looked at about 30 resumes before having a good slate to hire from. I made an offer to one of those candidates.” I had applied on day 3 and was never even seen by HR or the HM. It’s just that competitive for remote right now. “FWIW: both my kids are WFH. They put in way more than 8 hours a day since the computer is right there and they keep working.” This is not the selling point you think it is, at least not from the worker’s point of view. There is something to be said for being able to get up from your desk, leave, and not think about work until tomorrow. If your kids are working extra hours because hey, the computer’s right there and they don’t have anything else to do, that means they need to learn how to unplug and get a life, not that they’re model WFH employees. Most successful long term WFH people have said they are so because they have some kind of barrier between work and leisure spots in the house; usually an office, but in one case it’s literally a different computer on the opposite side of his home office desk; “Get up, walk around the table, have different wall decor in view” is still enough to do a mental reset. That’s what’s going on in all the industries everywhere: everyone is being mandated back to office full time. I think we’re all stuck. Exactly. This was me during covid. I’d roll out of bed at 6:30 or 7, check my e-mail and then just never leave my chair until a short lunch break or dinner, after which I would often be back in my chair. My grandboss had the nerve to complain that we were all just on a long “vacation” and it was time to get back to work (in person). As we met incredible schedules and did amazing work. Later I found out that he was projecting. *He* was taking time off at home to do (important) things. And he figured we were all doing that. Hmm, that could explain a lot of of the unnecessary RTO pressure, now that you mention it. The situation in the letter sounds like terrible management all around. A mandate without any reasoning behind it besides “I want it so/other companies are doing it” won’t be well received, and ignoring said mandate by changing it and then letting people be wishy/washy about it is asking for trouble given that you know that it’s something that the CEO actually cares about, whatever the reason. I agree with Alison: get clear guidance from up top, be very clear in communicating the expectations and consequences of not following them, and let the chips fall where they may. Some thoughts (that pertain to jobs that can actually be remote): Management is a set of skills on its own; the skills for managing a fully in office team are different from those for a local hybrid team are different for those for a fully remote team that’s potentially spread across states and/or timezones. A lot of orgs/departments/managers don’t bother to put the time in to figure out what makes sense for their particular business needs and are trying to apply a one-size-fits-all strategy. I was on a team that stayed fully remote after things opened up, both because of the nature of the work and the personalities of the people. The more casual and/or social interactions were done via non work-related chats about various topics and (actually) optional virtual events that weren’t so often as to a be nuisance, were organized by different people so it didn’t become part of one person’s job, and were scheduled during the work day before closing so as not to interfere with personal time. Several people have mentioned loneliness/boundaries between work and home and while I don’t feel the same, I get it. My issue is if your office is already hybrid, what’s stopping you from going in all you want? Presumably everyone who feels the same would also be going in regularly/frequently so a mandate wouldn’t be needed. If you are going in and finding you’re the only one there (i.e., it doesn’t solve the loneliness problem), that might indicate that the company’s culture isn’t a good fit and it’s worth considering whether moving on wouldn’t be better. That element of socialization used to be a given for office work, so people like me for whom it is very draining would to have to factor that in and keep it pushing. The difference now is that those who really thrive with it can’t take for granted that it will be a part of their work day. Lastly – one thing I didn’t see mentioned before I started typing is that some orgs are doing RTO mandates with the express purpose of pushing people out and avoid layoffs. They know how many people have moved or are still local but rely on the time saved from commuting/the flexibility to get chores done or run an errand during a break, and are betting that enough of them aren’t willing to give that up and will quit. I don’t think that’s the case in OP’s company (it doesn’t seem like that CEO has thought it through that thoroughly, tbh) but since a lot of comments are addressing the RTO vs. hybrid vs. WFH question more generally, I thought it pertinent. I’m the LW! I can definitely take the feedback that in terms of this RTO mandate, my boss and I haven’t been the best. Our original thinking was that we wanted to be flexible and understanding because other than myself and one other person, the others’ commutes are like 1 to 1.5 hours. Plus, so many other departments were also in a huff over it that we felt we were following the mandate the closest and got by a year without complaints for the 2 days! So it’s just a bummer to be here now. I will say while the RTO thing is something to address head on per Allison’s guidance, we’ve been able to set a pretty good structure for our hybrid team. Because half the team is remote permanently as they live in different states and timezones. So during COVID, which is when things started shifting, we adjusted over time and do pretty well. Always places to learn, but better than we were before for sure (not just for work but for culture as well). So yes to your notes on that being considerations people need to take for hybrid and/or remote situations. The team is great. The real issue is just the appearing IRL. (I don’t know but my original comment didn’t post so this may show up twice?) I think there’s at least a 50% chance that the CEO doesn’t have the stones to fire anyone and things stay as they are. An update would be brilliant. “You will lose talented experienced workers and see a decline in productivity…” Do you have a source for that? this post reminded me of another letter where an employee was coming in to work, clocking in, then clocking out again and going home. Did we ever get an update to that? That was common enough that there was a whole term for it, although it escapes me at the moment! And I think OP is saying-not-saying that it’s an okay solution as far as she’s concerned! Coffee badging? Aside from coffee badging being wrong in principle, it would seem that when you head home after badging in, your employer is paying you for travel time. I guess presumably you could add that time back onto the end of the day, which is what I do when I run errands at lunch or something. But in the letter we had here about it, I admit it was Not A Great Look haha. I suppose if the whole reason for RTO is the passionate love of spontaneous hallway conversations, leadership really might be satisfied with mornings / a couple hours a day of that (but in the letter I got the impression the guy turned 180 degrees after badging in and left, so probably not even *one* spontaneous hallway convo in that time period … At my husband’s office, someone didn’t even coffee badge. They reportedly were caught on camera pulling up, swiping and returning to their car. And thus significant rumors started that IT would track internet pings and if you were under 4hrs, you’d have issues/it wouldn’t count to the 60% monthly in office requirement (which is already an obnoxious calculation because you inevitably need to be more in more than 3 days a week given partial weeks at the end/beg of each month.) The letter Meemur is referring to is “I’m in trouble for badging in, then going back home” (first letter on the short answer post from November 14, 2023). As of right now, there’s no update for that letter. That LW didn’t seem to think there was any problem with what they were doing, so good odds it didn’t end great for them That’s the one, thank you. I couldn’t remember the term at all I’m not 100% sure, but it sounds like that LW worked for the same place I do (it’s the exact same set-up and the mandate she was describing sounded word-for-word like my company’s). If I’m right, then LW’s only options were to get fired, quit, or suck it up and go to the office, unfortunately. Managers receive a regular report on their employees’ badge-in and badge-out times, and they do get dinged for chronically absent staff. Layoffs, terrible clients, working ’til 11pm.. This job doesn’t sound so great even if it was completely remote! Maybe this new mandate is the kick you need to look elsewhere? Yeah OP I hope you’re looking yourself so you can “be the change” – “we told you workers didn’t want to come back to the office, you insisted which is your right, now 25% of our workforce is giving notice, oh and I am also, my last day is in two weeks.” This is very satisfying! A question for Sloanicota. If you’re so convinced that 25% of your workforce will resign if asked to work in an office, what is to stop a company from laying off that 25% and replacing them with cheaper employees in India or another emerging market? After all, “work can be done anywhere” and you’re “just as productive” with permanent remote work, so why not go whole hog and get people who can work remotely from India? Well if the company wants to get people back into the office, hiring people thousands of miles away doesn’t seem to achieve that goal Well, you’d have to figure out the laws and schedules and payroll for an entire other country, or pay someone to handle it for you, which would eat away at the discount you receive from buying cheap outsourced labor. You also have to either pay them to work overnight or accept that you won’t have your employees available during standard business hours. 1. The transaction cost of handling payroll processing in India is trivial compared to what can be saved in salaries. If it weren’t, outsourcing would not be a thing. 2. The “follow the sun” model is a thing, and many businesses find it a feature, rather than a bug. 3. Even if you find time zones a showstopper, then substitute “Argentina” for “India.” Not quite as cheap, but still cheaper than the US. My company is one of these – we have workers literally around the globe. Teams working together regularly span 8, 12, or even 16 hours worth of time zones. If you’re not used to it, it sounds impossible but it does work in the end. A lot of people work unusual hours (being on the US West Coast I work start work at 7am but then I have a ton of flexibility later in the day when everyone else is offline. On the other hand a lot of people in India work more like noon-8pm local time). But our workload is such that you don’t need to be working long hours, just weird ones sometimes. Biggest downside is that with very little working-hours overlap most questions and requests don’t get answered until the next day. Which slows things down but people accept that. I do assume at some point my job could be outsourced (they’re already no longer hiring in my region, new hires for my role are all in Spain now), but I’ll deal with that if it happens (thus far they’re just moving things via attrition, not layoffs). For a start, time zones. Even if work can be done anywhere, you have to be awake to be answering emails and logging into remote meetings. As someone currently doing a bunch of work with people in Europe, this is a huge deal. For a second, language barrier. For a third, it’s not necessarily the case that work that can be generally done remote doesn’t still need people in the office 1-2 days a month, for major meetings with clients, picking up and dropping off equipment, etc. For a fourth, there’s tax implications that most businesses are not able to meet to using a foreign workforce while claiming to be a domestic company. “For a second, language barrier.“ Shockingly, English is widely spoken at a native level in India. Setting that aside, I have invested in tech companies that hire programmers in Ukraine and other countries. For mechanical work like programming it works just fine. Grammar Ly is a great example of a company that does software development in Ukraine, and yet English proficiency is its core mission. The case for keeping employees in the US rests on collaboration and willingness to interact in person. If you’re insisting on full time work from home, someone in India or another offshore market can do y the same thing much more cheaply. Be careful what you wish for. In my experience, Indian English is generally VERY different from American or British English. Language barrier doesn’t always mean “we speak different languages,” it can also mean, “we technically speak the same language but our grammar and cultural norms are so different that it is hard to communicate.” And yet there are plenty of companies across the US that don’t outsource as a punishment for workers who would prefer to WFH. Instead, these businesses provide their domestic employees with flexible remote or hybrid work options because it makes good business sense for them to do so. And for what it’s worth, there are scores of us who can successfully WFH while still successfully collaborating and interacting with colleagues. Plus companies that can, by the nature of their work, be “Remote Only” and don’t need much of an office footprint save a bunch of money. IIRC, the two biggest expenses for a company are salaries and real estate related costs. I mean, by that logic nobody should ever advocate for better working conditions. LOL. Inglish is not Anglish (Indian English is not the same as American English.) I’ve worked for companies with a “follow the sun” model for operations. Handoffs are still a PITA. This is unnecessarily combative Short answer: It’s going to be automation, the grand wave of US outsourcing is pretty much over. Long answer: As someone who has done the work assessing where to put new offices for a global manufacturing company, while you *could* get people to work from anywhere, there’s a lot of factors to consider when looking at where to hire: 1. The emerging market must have a certain level of technically literate people, so that you have a decent applicant pool. Many of those markets have been exploited to the point that the salary levels + mgmt costs have risen significantly over the last 20 years. We considered MX, CN, IN, Brazil, and Hungary, as we already had operations in those countries. Only China still had slack in the labor market; BR, HU, and MX salaries + mgmt costs were on par with US, and we still had a lot of turnover for higher paying jobs. I forget whether IN was on par, but the turnover was high there too, much higher than in the US for the same functions (accounting / audit / order placing / cust service). 2. Political issues and stability matter. European countries have fewer political concerns, but no salary savings there. 3. The importance of office / tech costs surprised me. We ended up not going w Hungary because there was no space in the Hungary office for more people, and a new office space was VERY expensive. People could not wfh in most of the emerging markets, the electricity and connectivity just weren’t there. HU / MX people often had to come in to the office to load the work they’d done. We looked at some other costs that I forget, but those three were the critical factors. In 2014, my employer put the team in an existing Chinese office, but the employer closed down that team in 2022 as part of reducing their Chinese footprint. I think they just did away with the function, but I know they brought a couple other functions back from CN / EU to the US, where they’d suddenly regained a lot of office space due to WFH and owning the buildings. Right now, CN would probably welcome the jobs back, but with Russia / Ukraine and CN / Taiwan, plus tariffs…. it’s a hard sell for outsourcers. This is super interesting! Just replying to signal boost it. I bet this would be great as a stand alone post, maybe in an interview format. Agree! I would love for Alison to interview this person if both are willing! … But the company wouldn’t take this awesome cost saving measure anyhow, laying off the more expensive stateside people? Having worked with teams from India, for some reason that doesn’t work very well. There are cultural and time zone communication issues, for one. The management style and resulting work ethics and habits are different. You end up spendsing a lot of time making sure everyone is on the same page, and even then, it sometimes goes very much sideways. Honestly, jobs that can be successfully outsourced will be regardless. Jobs that can be successfully automated will be. It’s been happening for decades now. It seems unlikely that resistance to RTO mandates without any reasoning behind them will be the thing that causes a whole bunch of previously domestic jobs to be outsourced, if the COVID-times demonstration of how many jobs could be done remotely didn’t. So your argument is we should never advocate for better working conditions in case our employers fire us anyway and outsource? That’s what stood out to me not what the CEO says goes. OP I think part of the reason you are so stressed about this mandate is you are really burned out on this job. You work late then still have to show up the next morning because your CEO has a butts in seats mentality. On top of which you have to act like you are happy. Not only are you going to lose good people over this, since as you say you are isolated in online meetings anyway so why are people in the office? But they are going to lose you, either a breakdown or you leave for saner pastures. I would opt for looking for a job while you still have the energy to do it. That stood out to me too! LW, you sound exhausted. Are there better options out there for you? Even if you’re personally okay with the RTO, it sounds like it wouldn’t hurt to look around. I know that’s hard when you have so little free time, but it can absolutely be worth it. FWIW, it feels like there’s another big wave of RTO mandates coming down, just from my anecdotal experience. Most of my friends who work for companies with new RTO orders are looking for other work. If they were hired for remote jobs, it now feels like part of their compensation package to not have to commute, buy new office clothes, wear makeup every day, and be constantly watched. Getting that taken away without any additional perks to make up for it (and often with a fair amount of condescension and implications that they’re not doing their jobs) is enough to drive good employees away. Haha, I really wasn’t expecting comments to point this out to me, but I guess on re-read of my letter it makes sense why. LW here. Thank you for your concern, and you’re all right, I am quite exhausted. I won’t mention the hours I worked this week answering a proposal from an international client who gave us barely 5 business days to respond when we normally need 3 weeks for a project of that size. I’ve been at this company going on 7.5 years now. My friends and ex-coworkers have all asked me the same thing: look elsewhere! There’s a million excuses I gave before. I will say despite this lame job, one thing I do have here is that I do have a lot of flexibility thanks to my boss. He runs our department in its own little pocket (hence part of the reason for this RTO mandate situation) and it’s saved me from a lot of the political garbage that goes on around here. But the higher I’ve gone, the more I see it, and it’s adding to my stress + on top of the regular work. The terrible clients are paying us less. I do want to escape. But my industry the last 2-3 years has been hit HARD. The avg before of people being out of work was 3 – 6 months. Lately it’s been 1 – 1.5 years. That’s so scary to me. But I applied for graduate school to change careers so crossing my fingers! Though given my working hours the past year and a half, I don’t think my goal of doing both at the same time is going to be feasible. I will probably vaporize into nothing! That’s what happened to me! I started a remote job during Covid and eventually it was time to return to in-office work. I realized that I didn’t want to see these jerks in person, the only way I tolerated the job was because I didn’t have to sit next to them all day. The job itself was pretty crappy and the return to office notice was my kick to look for a new job. Not to mention “nonstop meetings”–ugh! Working til 11 is really egregious Someone seriously needs to speak up and tell the CEO what the truth is. That forcing people into an office is antiquated and not necessary. We are in the 21st century now and we have proven for the last 5 years we can work from home and be MORE productive. It’s also cheaper. It also allows disabled people to work. It allows people who are chronically ill to work, because commuting is the hardest part of any job. If everyone either quit or refused to work until he sees the light of day maybe that will convince him. Also, you don’t have to remain as in the middle as you have been. If this is a settled situation in your CEO’s mind, don’t feel obligated to allow your team to rehash the reasons they’re against it over and over. It’s completely fine to start saying “the CEO has made his decision” and decline to provide a sounding board for an additional round of argument. Agreed. I’ve had managers who did that, and I actually respected them. They basically said “this isnt my call. I can’t change it, this is what has come down from above. If you choose not to do this, then we can figure out the best way to move forward.” I think it’s the clarity and consistency that is key. I disagree with the take that “CEO’s word stands,” but you need to be strategic on what battles you pick and how you pick those battles (in other words, politics). And you need to be willing to accept the consequences of your path. I’ve had some kooky CEOs who did some kooky policies (looking at you, tech start-up). Sometimes I flat out told them that I would not enforce those policies because they were illegal/violated our client agreement/unethical and would have us laughed out the door by any decent client. Sometimes I nodded and said I would need to “evaluate the application of that policy”, then changed absolutely nothing and waited for the CEO to get distracted by the next shiny idea (some well placed bureaucracy can work wonders). Sometimes I would enforce part or all of it, especially if it was something that didn’t really impact my team at all (if it barely impacts you, no reason not to apply it). No matter what I chose to do, I was always very clear with my team about what I expected of them, and that if anyone got in trouble, it would be me. And if I said we would do X, then I enforced that (usually just through gentle reminders, but sometimes through a serious sit-down and “hey, this is part of your job and you need to do it”). Yeah. You’re just the messenger here. Not your decision, and not your responsibility to try to argue it. You can make it clear you think it’s not a good situation, if that’s what you think, and still make it clear that it’s not one you can change. I agree that clarity and then drawing a line under the discussion will help. From the employee side — I feel uncomfortable when middle managers come across as asking for reassurance that I’m not upset about the changes. My responsibility is to be pleasant and professional, and to take or leave the working conditions that leaders have decided we’re going to have. So I’m looking, and in the meantime, I’m doing my job well, showing up when you want me to (whether it makes sense to me or not), and being pleasant and professional. But I wish my grandboss would stop pressing, “I know you prefer more flexibility, how are you REALLY feeling about policy X?” Short answer: I wish I could upvote! Long answer: There are many things I am unhappy about at my job. Yes, I am evaluating and planning my future. Meanwhile, do not ask me to perform the emotional labor of assuring anyone about how I am REALLY feeling about policy X. I feel like I should do my job. Please and thank you. Yep. If people end up leaving over that, then they leave, and you communicate to the higher-ups what you can feasibly accomplish while you’re searching for and training their replacements. If the higher-ups don’t care what’s feasible, or you get tired of having to replace people over this, then you start thinking about your next move, too. The problem is, you have to make a lot of in-the-moment judgment calls about what to do about people not complying. How many days a month can someone work from home for a seemingly reasonable reason (sick kid, plumber coming, etc.) before you have to speak to them? How quickly do you escalate the discipline? Does the CEO really want you to fire people over this? Just if they come in less than once a week? less than three times a week? Over what period? What if they’re a high performer with a hard-to-find skill set? What if it’s because their kid is going through a medical issue? When the rubber meets the road, OP has to decide what to do, and it sounds like their leadership isn’t giving them the guidance they need to implement this new policy. Way before 2020 I had a battle with my boss and bosses boss about my employees working from home. I lost. While it still irks me I knew it wasn’t something I was going to win if I pushed more than I already had so I made my employees come in when needed and defended them rightly when it made sense (I got a full WFH accommodation for one employee). I suspect that there’s an aspect of “… or else what?” And the answer isn’t “Or else everyone not doing 5 days in office will be immediately fired, and we’ll just hire someone else to do your job.” It’s more “As the mid-level manager, you should be able to cajole cheerful workers back into the office full-time with the power of your personality.” If anything, I think OP would be doing both themselves and their team a big favour by taking a firmer stance on this. At present, it sounds like the team has no good reason to believe that the rules they’re being asked to follow actually mean anything. They’ve been given directives from the CEO, but then middle management bends the rules and basically render those directives meaningless. But they’re not meaningless: the CEO clearly does care about this issue and is getting increasingly unhappy, to the point that HR is pulling key records, and may well implement an even stricter policy. It feels a bit like the middle management has been trying to be Cool Boss and creating further confusion. Unfortunately, the time to speak up was when the CEO first said people should be in three days a week. Instead all the teams basically just ignored him to do their own thing which is going to make bargaining with him now a lot more difficult. LW, when you guys decided to try two days in the office instead of three did you even tell your CEO you were doing that? Or did you just sneak around him? Ultimately WFH works on a trust-based system that employees are actually doing work while at home, and not spending time doing other things. LW would have had a lot more leverage if everyone had come back into the office 3 days a week and productivity dropped. Instead, they did not enforce the CEO’s direct order. Now trust has been lowered and the opportunity to clearly show the decline is gone. I get that the order might be for something unnecessary and possibly with bad effects on productivity. I do. But unless it’s something actively illegal or seriously unethical, disobeying a direct order is a really bad way to start a negotiation over something a CEO doesn’t want to do in the first place. I would argue that WFH doesn’t really rely on trust. Most jobs involve tasks that can be checked. Are emails and phone calls getting answered in a timely matter? Are projects getting done? Are clients and co-workers getting what they need? If so, then clearly the person is actually doing work while at home. LW here! For the first part of your message: That’s not true, when the CEO first gave the mandate, even higher senior people than I did tell the CEO it wasn’t a good idea. There were weeks of ongoing discussions that my boos would fill me in on. And from there is the waterfall affect of different departments doing their own. For your second question: I don’t speak to the CEO! Thankfully, he’s terrible. My boss who regularly does didn’t outright say this is what we’re doing to put a spotlight on us. He used his magic to tell him yes we’re in office the majority of the mandate (my boss is a very skilled people person. Whereas my feelings are easily read on my face, hence the no CEO interaction by design of mine). (Hoping this comment goes through but it might not!) My organization has been navigating layoffs over the last two years. We haven’t been able to give ample raises or bonuses, and our staff is exhausted. Instead of asking them to start commuting again, we let them stay home. Return to office is like getting a pay cut – do you really want to give your employees a pay cut when they’re working harder than ever with fewer colleagues? I think the CEO needs a reality check. Yes! It is like getting a paycut. Paying for gas, parking, public transportation, lunches, coffee, extra childcare, you name it. We don’t talk about that enough. Nor the fact that our lives have a better balance. Yet weren’t they paying for those same things when they were in office before the pandemic? They’ve gotten a pay raise for the few years they’ve been working from home with not having those expenses. Exactly. It’s a pay raise they got, and now they are losing that pay raise. People get upset when a pay raise is clawed back. (in this case substitute “benefit” for “pay raise” if necessary). Except that pay raise was immediately eaten up by inflation that wages didn’t keep up with. Yes, and no one likes having their pay raise taken away. Yep. Bonus points if they haven’t gotten a raise in their paycheck or a raise that didn’t keep up with inflation (which has been huge in the last few years). Which has been my situation for over a decade. The biggest “pay increase” that I got was being able to work remotely. Just the savings in fuel and car insurance are a noticeable change. RTO is essentially a blatant pay cut. Yes? And walking back a pay raise is by definition a pay cut. Since the commenter said their company has been dealing with layoffs for 2 years, that makes me think their employees have not had a raise or bonus in those two years. Which means they are behind where money is concerned even if they are remote. If you go remote and it is seen as, you are saving money so technically this is a raise, fine. For the first year that is true. At year 2 it is no longer a raise, it is where your compensation falls. So at that point, if you are asked to come back in AND given no raise, you are losing money. Same for anyone hired as a remote worker. If all I have known with a company is being remote and they turn around and tell me I have to come in, I am going to feel like I am losing compensation that I bargained for, because now I have potentially thousands extra in costs a year that were not there when I started the job. It is absolutely a pay cut to go from being remote to in office. Also restaurants are a lot more expensive now. Most COL are about 3%. While rents dipped for a time, they have risen with a vengeance. Utilities, and food have risen in price much more than that since 2020. My rent has gone up by 50% since 2020, for example. (and before anybody suggests moving, what I’m paying is simply what a similar, few-frills apartment costs in my area, there simply is no place to move that is cheaper without giving up things like closets, being able to fit my sofa into the living room, being able to see a tree) Extra childcare? If your commute means you take another hour to pick up your kid, that’s one more hour of childcare every day that’s needed. Possibly two if you also need to drop them off earlier in the morning. Or if you have older children that don’t need constant supervision and you can easily work with them home, but they are not old enough to be home alone (I’m not a parent, but I’m thinking about 10ish-year-olds) This is my situation. My kids are old enough to take care of themselves while I finish work after they get out of school, but not old enough to stay home alone. If I had to return to the office, I’d have to pay for 5 days of afterschool childcare a week (if I could even find it, programs fill up as soon as registration opens around here), while also paying for extra gas and exorbitant parking costs. Correct! This is exactly my case, my kids are 9 and 12, old enough to entertain themselves for 3 hours, but not old enough to be left alone for that same period of time. We use our lunch hour to pick them up from school, and then we continue working for a few more hours with them on their tablets or tv or whatnot. If we had to go back to office full time, we would have to pay for someone or someplace for them to be taken care of, and in California that means several hundred dollars more a month for just 3 hours a day. The CEO has had a reality check already – his reality is that the people who work for him aren’t paying attention to instructions. And it sounds like the LW and other people in senior leadership have attempted to give him that reality check but it hasn’t worked – so now what do they do? Two points jump out at me: The discussion about why to mandate RTO makes not even a nod to getting the work done; and the LW believes (likely correctly) that the CEO is a petulant child. Some jobs can be done just fine remotely, while others cannot. If the job works fine done remotely, insisting on RTO will put the company at a competitive disadvantage. Some other company in the same business but without the RTO hang-up will be at a huge advantage in recruitment and retention. And if your CEO actually makes critical business decisions based on his fee-fees being hurt, this is a huge problem even apart from RTO. I’d love to chart this out somehow. I’d say some percent of jobs – rarely whole fields – are significantly more effective to do at home as long as you have the right employee in place. Some of course can’t be remote or even flexibly at all – shift coverage on-site jobs. But maybe there’s 10% of jobs that are basically solitary and require a lot of deep uninterrupted thinking time and experience a significant boost. Then there’s the vast category in the middle (speaking only of white collar office fields) where there’s maybe a measurable markdown of value to the employer – but to the employee it’s such a coveted benefit that it could be worth it in retention/attracting talent. Seventy-five percent of a truly excellent employee is worth 100% of a mediocre one in most roles, not all. I have read reports and seen figures for this in the UK, and without looking them up I think it’s about 1/3 of jobs went fully remote during Covid, and the vast majority of those have gone to hybrid, with full-time employees expected to spend 2-3 days a week in the office and part-time employees pro-rata’d to 40-60%. There are a few employers who have either gone fully remote (usually smaller organisations who were renting office space and have realised they don’t actually need it), or who have mandated full-time in-office work, but these are both rare and not indicative of larger trends. I have seen one commentator say that the UK is diverging from the US on this issue — which I think may be because our distances just aren’t as great and our population is more concentrated, so hybrid actually works for the vast majority of people. Working 2 days a week in office means people can tolerate somewhat longer commutes than working 5 days in the office, and for most people the benefits don’t aggregate significantly if you go to fully remote. Like, yes, technically you could move to the the Highlands if you were fully remote, but the number of people who want to do that is pretty small. Whereas the number of people who can now take jobs up to 2 hours away has significantly increased. And actually a lot of us do appreciate 1-3 days in the office even if we don’t want to do it every day. I actually like hybrid as an employee, but from the organization’s standpoint it’s the least efficient for cost savings, because they still have to have office space to fit everybody (especially if they want in-office days to be the same for most staff like “everyone on Mondays” – and if they *don’t* do that, they get the “why did I have to drive in just to have all-remote meetings with other people who aren’t in the office” issue) – and they mean most employees have to have a fully kitted out home office as well. I done manage office space but I’ve been in meetings about it and I think the discussion was that at 3 days in-office you need so close to 100% office space,l that it makes no difference, but at 2 days a week there’s a substantial saving — you’re looking at 60-80% of the full time equivalent, as long as it’s well-designed for hot desking and you’ve got a mixture of other spaces for confidential meetings, casual meetings, etc. *don’t manage office space, that should say! I think the other reason we’re diverging is the cost of accommodation in London especially. If you are living in a tiny flat or a house share where you have a rota for the use of the table, it’s a lot less appealing to work remotely. Also you have to heat it and pay for WiFi and electricity costs are going up. I think the excessive cost of property either rental or owned in London is a factor. Almost all my younger and more junior colleagues in London want to be in more often because they have a better working environment that way. It was definitely true for me when I was early-career; I was sharing a house with four people, so I would not have wanted to work from home at all (although even then I would have coveted flexible hours at least). That’s just London, though, right? I have multiple friends in the UK, and they (and the other people at their companies) work almost exclusively from home, which is their preference. Only one of them is in London, though. Yup! Outside of London, the option is often smallish place close to work or plenty of space with a bit of a longer commute, but one which is perfectly doable for most for 2-3 days a week, and allows a home office and a lot more nice house stuff (a garden, or a walkable life when not at work, or whatever). Another key difference between UK and US is the PTO. UK has much better PTO practices and protections than the US. And that’s without factoring in that the UK parental leave is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better. I’m curious about the UK childcare practices. That’s a big issue for anyone with kids in the US (childcare is expensive and can be hard to find in some areas). Is the UK the same or different? Really not much better, as far as I can tell. It’s not too hard to find childcare where I am (some parts of the country it is), but in 2020 when my youngest started school we were paying £926 a month for Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, which was the government subsidised rate for 3-4 year olds. For unsubsidised 0-2 year olds back then it was £1400 a month for one child full-time. We’re in a medium CoL area, and there’s been significant inflation since then, plus increases to the minimum wage, both of which childcare is very exposed to, so it’lll be a lot more now. The thing that does make a big difference is that flexible working and part-time work is much more common, so it’s not all or nothing. I’ve work 60%, 80% and 90% of full time hours over the last ten years, and that’s been totally ok with 5 different employers, 4 of which were advertising full-time jobs but were fine with me asking for 0.8 or 0.9 contracts. So we haven’t actually full-time childcare since 2017, when my second child was born. That second paragraph is really interesting. I haven’t really seen any U.S. employer that was okay with a FT role becoming 80% or 90%. And it’s pretty rare for the U.S. to do contracts. We have the right to request flexible working (which includes part-time), and can’t be penalised for it (obviously that’s the theory, and a bad manager can retaliate just like they can for any other protected characteristic or act.) The bar for saying no is legally pretty low— if you’ve advertised a job as full-time, it’s pretty straightforward to say,”no, we need someone full-time”. But culturally, especially in most large organisations and the public sector, there’s a strong trend towards saying yes if you can make it work. Especially if you’re talking about someone working a 4 day werk or a 9 day fortnight, it’s quite widely assumed that the workload won’t be that much lower, the impact on morale is high, and it’s cheaper for the employer. And any large employer will have an HR and payroll system which very easily copes with pro-rata-ing pay, pension, benefits, annual leave etc. Yep – I don’t have kids but the majority of my friends who had children went back to work on a part-time basis after their maternity leave. We’re in our mid-forties now so the kids are older, and some of my friends have gone back up to five days a week, but some of them have stuck with three or four days. My sister does four days a week now. In my industry (book publishing) it’s very, very common for women who have children to negotiate to come back part-time or four days a week after their maternity leave. I’d say it’s so common that I’d almost expect it. And even before Covid, plenty of women negotiated a hybrid working pattern – say they’d be in the office Monday/Tuesday, work from home Wednesday/Thursday, and that would be their four days a week. And of course now we’re all hybrid – and we have flexible hours so if you have kids you can start later so you can do the school run in the morning and whatnot. I think publishing has always been very open to more flexible working (possibly because there are a lot of women in publishing). As you say, everything’s pro-rated and that’s also very normal, so it’s not a problem for a company to deal with pro-rated holiday, salary etc etc. Or there are jobs which can be done equally as well either in office or remote — remote doesn’t have to be either more effective or less effective to be a benefit a lot of workers want. During lockdown, we discovered that some parts of our jobs were better in person (but we lived with the online/remote version because we had to), some parts were just as effective (different, but same value and outcome), and some parts were better remote/online. After the lockdown we were told we had to come back in office fulltime. We lost several very good employees that way. Upper management was convinced eventually to allow hybrid — 3 days in office, 2 days remote. We could actually be just as effective with one or two days in office, but most of us are reconciled to the schedule we have. I think there are also jobs where there’s positive value to hybrid. People on my team need to be able to collaborate, work together informally, have in-depth discussions in office, have spontaneous chats when they run into each other, etc. But many of them also need to write, or code, or otherwise concentrate for some stretch of time, and that’s harder to do in open cubes. Hybrid gives people some flexibility to benefit from in-person interaction but also have some time with fewer distractions for more focused work. There’s also the fact that since we went remote and then came back hybrid, my work/life boundaries have blurred in ways that are beneficial to my employer. If I have a medical appointment I take much less time off if I’m in the routine of easily logging on from home afterwards, compared to when we were fully in-office and I didn’t even have a work laptop, just a desktop. I’m also way more likely to check Teams and email from the waiting room at that appointment, which isn’t good for me but is good for my employer. I would probably be less grouchy about RTO as a trend if I hadn’t spend the last five years before I went to remote watching office quality descend hellishly lower and lower. I’m sorry, but if you’ve implemented squished open benches into echoey high-ceiling warehouses that you’re calling “hot desking” – you can’t be surprised that workers don’t want to be there. I couldn’t even concentrate for five minutes at my last job before I went remote. Our office is decent by current standards – people have assigned cubes, it’s a newly remodeled building, we all have sit/stand desks, the kitchen facilities are well-maintained, conference room tech mostly work well, pretty much everyone gets a bit of sunlight, etc. The cubes are a reasonable size and have above-desk-height dividers and another foot or so of frosted glass above that, coming to maybe chest height? But still, people can hear others on the phone, see and hear them walking by, and the exact same informal collaboration or question from a neighbor that provides some of the benefits of in-person work also creates distractions. Yes! My office does hotdesking, and if all the people who could go in, went in, we would run out of desks. The biggest issue is for HR and Finance, who don’t have their own office. They regularly deal with sensitive information and don’t have a place in the office where they can handle it. Second biggest issue is the people who work with team members and clients remotely. I’ve had days where I went to the office, then spent the majority of the day in a closet on calls to people in other timezones. Yeah, I would be willing to do hybrid or maybe full RTO if I had a semi-private workspace. I would immediately be searching for another job if they wanted me to return to open-office hell. Yup I can do some of my work as a physician from home (paperwork, patient calls, telehealth visits) I know a psychiatrist who works now entirely from home doing telehealth A surgeon can do almost none of their work from home Even within our office Our scheduler cannot do any of her work from home as she checks patients in and out from live appointments Our health coach, who also does some scheduling, can do some of her work from home The best professional relationship I have right now at work is with someone at another site I have met once in person but we chat online all the time about shared patients and resources. The complicating factor is that what is more effective for an individual job isn’t necessarily more effective for the department, or company, as a whole. I worked at a software company that mostly had a really annoying butts in seats mentality. But they allowed work from home when an ice storm shut things down. The senior programmer was much more productive on work from home days. They spent a not insignificant amount of time in office answering questions and brainstorming with other developers. But their loss in productivity was more than offset by the benefits of their mentorship to other people, to the company (and also to their own job satisfaction.) Right. Sometimes it’s a win-win, sometimes it’s more of a tradeoff between the org’s benefits and the employee’s benefits. But most of us aren’t rewarded on the job for the work we help others accomplish – we have our own productivity metrics that we’re being evaluated on. Many managers tend to see it as a waste of the senior person’s time! The senior person is working on important, super challenging stuff. They’re super productive. They don’t have time to be interrupted by the junior person’s 100 questions on something unimportant. So I take “developing juniors” to be sort of BS. Strong agree! My company lost 100% of the people who were hired during our covid WFH within 3 years of their coming on board, compared to most people staying 5-10 years and people retiring after 30 not being unusual. The new folks were not getting the kind of informal support and mentoring that naturally occurs when you can pop your head into someone else’s office for a quick question. Normally we hire junior engineers straight out of college and groom them for management. Last year we had to hire someone into a management position from outside the company for the first time in over a decade because we don’t have the pipeline of talent ready. I think the AAM commentariat in general is way too focused on it being better for them to finish their individual work and unwilling to acknowledge how their individual deliverables are not the end all be all. This jumped out at me too: are the remote workers getting their work done? That’s the dispositive question in this whole argument. LW mentions that their team is high-functioning; is that true of the company in general? If it is, and the CEO is swayed by news reports or studies, someone should show him the Pew research study about remote workers. (I’ll drop the link in a reply.) Not only is a return-to-office mandate a resume generating event, but the likelihood that employees will leave instead of giving up remote work is tied to their overall job satisfaction. If LW’s weariness, late hours, crappy clients and low morale are shared by other high-performing employees, the business may lose more people than it can afford. Will remote employees leave if ordered back to the office? Survey says: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/01/13/many-remote-workers-say-theyd-be-likely-to-leave-their-job-if-they-could-no-longer-work-from-home/ Some other company in the same business but without the RTO hang-up will be at a huge advantage in recruitment and retention. This, plus the cost savings from not requiring a large office footprint and the associated real estate and utility costs. If commercial real estate costs $0.50/sqft/month, and each employee requires as little as 150 sqft, remote work saves them at least $75/month per employee, plus electric expenses. Call it $1000/employee per year. Downtown San Jose is around $3/sqft/mo, or $36/sqft/year. Multiply that by 150 sqft/per employee, and in-office costs a minimum of $5,400/employee/year. Not chump change. This will become a competitive advantage for the companies that manage for it. We’re supposedly back in the office full time, too, supposedly with no exceptions. It’ll be interesting to see what happens in February. Will we get talked to if we worked from home? I decided to not ask permission and just do it. I’m going to let the chips fall where they may. I should clarify that I come in most of the time. However, I will work from home around doctor appointments so I don’t have to take a full day off. Those are the chips that will fall, if any. I also asked for a raise. They need to understand that this decision has consequences. Okay but what do you do if they just decide to fire you? Are you at least telling your manager that you’re working from home on those days or just fully going rogue? Well, they could always decide to terminate my contract and try to replace me. That’ll cost them a lot and maybe even force them to hire more than one person to replace me. I will tell my managers, though. They know why I’m doing it, too, so I hope that helps my case. This makes sense to me. I have seen so many “policies” get enforced for a month then quietly die. Or be unenforceable to a ridiculous degree. Or get quietly ignored by some people but not others. It’s always interesting how it actually plays out. I’ve also quietly “forgotten” about certain policies that had no practical value and were simply in place at a senior leader’s whims. Usually they end up falling by the wayside. Unpopular opinion but I don’t have a lot of sympathy for the “junior employees need an in-person experience” line of argument, TBH. Is it probably true? Yes, maybe, although if the future of office work is trending towards being increasingly remote (at least in some fields) then maybe we should all be cultivating a generation with those skills, I don’t know. But more importantly as someone who’s not in management and isn’t paid to be in management, as an individual contributor, this is not a cromulent reason for me personally to waste time and resources on a commute to sit in a cube farm on hybrid zoom meetings all a day. Exactly. If management wants experienced employees to mentor junior employees, then put it in their goals and pay them for it. “Model appropriate office behavior” is something that is in the basic code of conduct most people sign to be hired. This isn’t formal mentoring or training. It would be easier to quantify if it was. Helping your coworkers when they have questions, modeling what they’re supposed to do, and continuously improving your own skills are basic assumptions of any job. Note – by continuously improving your own skills, I don’t mean “go out and get specific education in X”. I mean that when most people start there are some things at a company they are not as good at, from specific tech things to company procedures. A baseline unspoken expectation is that after some period of time, you should be able to perform those skills without needing support. This. I used to get dinged on my performance reviews for spending too much time helping junior team members and not doing my baloney projects. Thank you. What experience are junior employees getting anyway if everyone is stuck away in zoom meetings all day anyway? The lunchroom, water cooler talk isn’t really enough to justify taking morale completely. Oh and junior employees can pick up on bad morale just fine in person. Why is it that these discussions always seem to default to, “oh if we’re full-time in the office, everyone’s just sitting on Zoom”? Obviously SOME offices are like that, but I’m willing to bet that most aren’t! Even in-person meetings, the modeled in-office behavior I saw was my manager picking at his toenails while talking to us or the owner of the company having a screaming match with the head developer in our mostly-open office. Unless they mean the strangled smile you give to your coworkers as you walk to and from the bathroom or learning how to handle 40 hours a week of 3 people loudly talking about Gisele’s ex-husband Tom Brady. I tend to agree. I get it, I really do – we’ve had a few new people start since 2020 and I can see how much more difficult it is for them to get to grips with everything when it’s 90% Teams chat and video calls. It’s so much trickier than just being able to turn to someone sitting next to you and say ‘Can you show me how this bit of the database works?’ or whatever. And I agree that for junior members of staff, there isn’t that same immersion in people chatting about projects, hearing people taking phone calls, seeing how they interact, etc etc. But at the same time…I’m an experienced individual contributor, I’m not in management, and I don’t really buy the ‘we want people to have some office time because it’s better for collaboration’ stuff. I don’t *mind* going in – and luckily we’re only in two days a week – but I really wouldn’t want to do any more than two days a week. If I could do just one, I would, because honestly it would make my work-life balance so much better. I’m more productive at home than I am in the office, because there are fewer distractions, and I can do my job just as well from home as I can from the office. I realise that’s not the situation for everyone, and I particularly feel for young people trying to WFH in houseshares etc – I can see why being in the office would be beneficial for them. But personally, in my role, there’s no need for me to be dragging myself into the office twice a week just for the sake of physically sitting in the same room as my co-workers. And I think there are other solutions to the problem of it being more difficult for new employees. Like everyone new gets a “buddy” who is friendly and approachable and is their acknowledged go-to for questions they’d prefer not to ask their manager. and bonus if that person is one of the extroverts who chooses to regularly work from the office, or people who finds they work better with a commute to a different place, or someone who craves more person time and enjoys that work – match up the work to suit the needs of the people. I love mentoring, but not if I have to do it all in person, so I need to be careful about who I mentor (nearly all my mentoring has ended up being for people using similar skillsets but at different sites so even if we’re both in office we’re not in the same place, which means it’s easy and logical to build online ways of connecting most of the time). I’m not sure that’s the right way to look at it, though. Your employer is allowed to ask you to do all kind of things that you don’t personally find worthwhile. IF there is a real benefit to the employer of having people in the office to mentor junior staff (I realize that is a big “if”), then they are allowed to decide that in-person attendance is a required part of the job, regardless if you personally feel that it’s a good use of your time — just like being on call off hours, or extensive travel, or whatever other demands any job may make. Then you are allowed to choose to keep or leave that job. I’ve also found that a lot – a _lot_ – of that “mentoring” look a lot like “benign neglect” (if not “hazing”). Shockingly, training people is hard, even through skills emulation, and very few people are really aware of what behaviors they’re modeling. At best, it becomes a social “do as I say, not as I do” (capstoned by all these RTO CEOs zooming in from their beach house). It also takes time to do this, in the form of the new employee asking questions and interrupting workflows and the mentor having to figure out the answer and how to contextualize the answer. Double all of this for any new employee who’s neurodivergent and is thrown into a neurotypical office, quad it for all of the pits of vipers I’ve seen in so many offices. Thank you. If something is important enough to learn by osmosis, it’s important enough to be formally trained on! But employers don’t want to invest time in training new staff or further developing older staff, so rather than build workloads that can accommodate taking time for peer-to-peer professional development or whatever, we just hope someone overhears Fergus handling a client really well on the phone and decides to put that into practice themselves. I feel similarly about “hallway conversations” that in-office proponents feel are somehow the bedrock of workplace collaboration. I appreciate that seeing someone randomly in the hall might trigger a reminder that you needed to talk to Arya about XYZ, but this isn’t collaboration! This is what happens when you don’t have formalized processes or clear communication trees, etc. And even when you have those things, stuff can go wrong because we’re human. The solution isn’t “make sure you’re in the office to accidentally overhear/run into people,” and my colleagues forget to loop me into things just as often when I’m physically present as they do when I’m at home. If something is important enough to learn by osmosis, it’s important enough to be formally trained on! This is 100% wrong. Tribal knowledge and informal learning are, in fact, things. What is an example of “tribal knowledge” in the workplace? Segars, Creating a Tribal Approach for Innovation in Organizations, Harvar led Business Review 2019 Plenty of other literature out there on the subject too Hi, professional here! I am literally paid to help offices decide what to train on (consultant). “Learning by osmosis” isn’t actually a thing. It’s actually learning by observing and applying, often with a side of applying under guidance. It can have an important role in training, and I often include it as part of a formal training program. “Formal training” doesn’t mean “be lectured at”. It means having a dedicated structure of learning. Experiential learning is often a key part of that, and it often benefits from a formal structure! If experiential learning is left to the whim of the team, often there are elements that get overlooked. Even having a simple required checklist of activities that the person should experience under guidance is a huge benefit and improves both learning and morale. Thank you! I have a training component in my job, and as far as I’m concerned “formal training” means “we made a decision that staff need to know XYZ and someone will be delivering that content in a manner appropriate to the task and the staff.” “Learning by osmosis” isn’t actually a thing. It’s actually learning by observing and applying, often with a side of applying under guidance. You’re taking the term “osmosis” very literally. It’s shorthand for exactly what you describe, and WFH impedes what you describe, no mate what moniker you put on it. Having worked with a lot of teams to improve their L&D practices, plenty of people do interpret “learning by osmosis” literally. I’ve seen soooo many managers assume that just because someone is working next to an expert, they are learning from the expert. Meanwhile the expert ignores the (supposed) trainee and the trainee is having to learn in isolation (despite being physically next to someone). WFH does not impede learning by observation, but it is a different practice than what you might do in an office. There needs to be a lot more explicit communication. For example, we use a mandated checklist in observational learning and guided practice (i.e., watching someone do the thing, then having someone watch you do the thing) because otherwise people inevitably forget 1 thing out of 20 (especially because training isn’t their day job!). Remote people need to explicitly communicate- “hey, I’m going to be working on llama braids today, do you want to watch me?” rather than the trainee being able to say “hey, it looks like you might be working on llama braids- can I watch you?” Of course, different individuals have different communication styles, and some have a much tougher time training online rather than in-person. So results may vary if you just pick an expert on your team and say “teach someone”. Teaching is its own skill, and remote teaching is it’s own specialization within that. I trained people half a world away through only an IRC client, not even screen sharing, with a partial language barrier and a time zone barrier. The impedance is psychological. OMG, thank you for your last paragraph!! My last boss bragged that he managed by walking around, he was one of the first people to go back to the office after covid restrictions were lifted, and he complained often that the other offices were empty when he walked around. This isn’t collaboration!!! If you have to depend on just ‘running into’ people for collaboration, it might never happen. Why not just set a meeting or time to talk? And he also refused/seemed to hate formalized processes and clear communication trees. Your comment encapsulated all my feelings about this lol I don’t mind coming into the office, but it’s so much better when there’s some intentionality behind it. There is a benefit to in office work but it doesn’t happen unless you make it happen. If junior staff members need training and support, schedule “office hours”. If you’re wanting innovation, lay out what your key issues are and schedule workshops focusing on that. I agree with you; even if some soft skills and adjustments to work culture can be learned by observation, employers cheaping out on training, and leaving it to colleges and unpaid internships, I think is a disaster. This is how you get mismatches on both sides with “no one is hiring” on the one hand and “we can’t find the right people” on the other. Employers need to step up and do SOME training. 2008 really messed with a lot of minds. Absolutely. Lots of things are learned by observation, but you can formalize that observation process instead of just hoping a learning opportunity presents itself. Like my phone call example: instead of just hoping to be around when Fergus makes a call and discovering on your own that he’s good at it, a manager who knows Fergus is an ace on the phone can easily say “Okay, Arya, you’re going to shadow Fergus on his sales calls for the next couple of days so you can see how he does it. Make sure to pay close attention to the way he re-directs conversation if XYZ happens so that he doesn’t lose the sale.” One place I worked was famous for impromptu hallway meetings that were actually very effective. But at that place everyone was in offices, sometimes two to an office, and the custom was to close your door when you were heads down on something. So hallway convos were not disturbing to the people in their offices, it made the meetings very short (we didn’t have enough conference rooms anyway) and effective. This was a job that had a large field work (plus prep and post) component, so it made sense to have everyone there. My previous job was hybrid before the pandemic and went 100% remote during the pandemic. We would frequently hire entry-level employees – actual entry-level, often straight out of college with little to no work experience. We trained them extensively. Multiple presentations and many practice exercises and then when they were released to work they were paired with a more experienced person to answer questions and review their work for the first few months. Almost every experienced employee on the team took on a different leg of training so new hires could get to know their team members. We were a cameras on culture so new staff could put a face to the name. Experienced staff were expected to be kind, open, and available to help less experienced people. If they were not that would have been considered a problem. Newbies we hired during the pandemic learned their jobs just as quickly as those we hired before the pandemic. There were performance issues for some, sure, but they were issues those people would have had regardless of if they were in person or remote. Based on what I saw here I do not think learning by osmosis is a good enough reason to require in-person work, generally speaking. New employees, especially entry-level, need a ton of support and things spelled out for them no matter where they are working. I work for a remote-only company, and this is such an issue that we no longer hire entry-level people and just do entry-level work at the middle level. I’m a strong proponent of remote work, but every recent grad we have hired has struggled to the point of needing to be fired (after a long PIP and lots of coaching.) I strongly believe there are some workplace skills that most entry-level people cannot pick up in a fully-remote environment. I would include myself in that category, and my decade in an office did me well. When I was interviewing people last year for an in office job, we got lots of people wanting remote. Even if we did do remote, people with no experience in my industry (customs brokerage/international transportation) would massively struggle to learn what we do remote. You have to be sitting next to the person training you. I’ve seen people with no experience really struggle even being trained in person. Someone with experience going remote at a new job is a totally different hing. Recently seen on Twitter Three people interview for a job. Two of them want remote work. One says “I want to be in office so that I can learn the business.” Which one do you think the company (ceteris parabus) will pick? This really depends. I worked in many companies where this would be the case. After working two jobs that treated WFH as a “necessary evil” and a “drain on the company” I applied for a job that required only 2 days physically in the office, and a lot of independent tasks visiting sites for a day and then returning home to write reports and briefs. They wanted someone who was capable of independent work and didn’t need to be baby sat in an office all day. My mention of not being bothered by coming into the office and only WFH in emergencies was actually NOT viewed as a positive. Front line manager here, I agree that the world has changed and we should find ways to support new staff and integrate them into the team. It takes less effort in person, but I see that as something to deal with rather than a reason to be more in person. Seems like a bad manager problem. And if most everyone is teleworking, they are not going to be there for new staff anyway. Maybe the supervisor and a buddy will for the first few months, but not the whole team. If people have staggered schedules, it’s likely that people will be in virtual meetings and/or rarely or never being in the office the same days. Having someone come in to a largely empty office hurts their experience and integration. There was a letter last week that had this very problem, where the LW’s potential new workplace wanted them to be 100% in office for the first six months of the job, after which they’d be allowed to WFH parrt-time. Except everyone else was part-time since they weren’t new hires, so I couldn’t figure out what having the LW in 100% of the time was going to accomplish. Vehemently disagree, from experience. In fact this is one of the reasons I left a management job in 2023. Absolutely everyone claims to work greatly at home, but so many problems would fester, and yes, younger people fell behind and did not learn by osmosis. I was constantly trying to force trainings and interactions remotely, but it’s only partially effective. People online make it sound very robotic as if I just schedule a training and suddenly everyone is a perfect employee. It’s not like that IRL. IRL it’s junior person watching someone else (even subconsciously by sitting near them) and learning everything from a dozen keyboard shortcuts to listening to someone put a customer in their place so they know how far they can push boundaries. It also became a problem replacing myself. I’d keep end up putting out fires alone and no one learned what I was doing. I’d try recapping stuff later on and could tell people were only half listening And these were otherwise good people, the type you’d screen 500 resumes for a position before covid for. So I’ve gotten very skeptical of people claiming WFH is 100% perfect in every situation Yes, for a lot of people it’s harder to train someone remotely. I’ve done it over IRC, not even screen sharing, but it takes three times as long. With Zoom and screen sharing, it is easier, but not the same as in-person. I just don’t think the solution is to give up and require lengthy commutes and butts in seats. I would love to work from home full time, but I disagree that it’s not a good reason to work in-office. Those of us who came up working in the office full time picked up a lot just by being there, seeing other people work, seeing how people reacted to things/handled stuff, hearing conversations. There’s a *lot* you learn without formal training. We got the benefit of that, and so should younger people. Plus, it is to our benefit to have younger coworkers who gain that knowledge, so we don’t have to deal with them 5-10 years down the line when they are behind where they should be. I still wish I could be full time wfh, but I do see a benefit This is why companies need to invest in L&D (learning and development). A lot of companies over-rely on modeling to train junior employees. When the junior employees are remote or their team is remote, there are less opportunities to observe others and therefor model what they do. (side note- modeling wasn’t the most successful version to begin with. It worked great if you had someone who was dedicated to the training, but if your trainer checked out, you were just SOL) The over-reliance on modeling can definitely be replaced through other learning mediums. Formalized shadowing practices are often extremely helpful, and it means that things are less likely to fall through the cracks. Having a designated point of contact for questions and regular check-ins on progress is essential. A scheduled discussion about cultural elements, expectations, and what questions to ask your manager about team culture can troubleshoot sooo many potential issues! And these things can be designed to have a very low lift- for most teams that are good at training junior staff, it’s just a formalized version of what they already do. And a good L&D can design the process to support what’s already going right while filling in the gaps of what’s going wrong. When I was a junior employee I don’t remember my development being a priority for senior employees at all. I could ask my direct coworkers who maybe had a year or two under their belt but that’s about it. I’ve done two on-site onboardings, two pure-remote onboardings, and one hybrid (onsite for 6 of the first 8 weeks, then offsite 100%). I can’t make generalizations between which ones went better based on where I was physically, but I can make them based on whether or not the employer had an agenda of work for me to do and a plan to get me up to speed. My remote on-boarding went pretty smoothly! Because we have a ton of resources and procedures and etc to use and a strong culture of working remotely. unfortunately they make us all commute to offices to work remotely from each other. Agreed. I’ve done lots of on-site onboardings, and three remote onboardings. In both cases, if they didn’t have a list of everything, it took much, much longer. The on-site wasn’t generally any better because without a good checklist, you didn’t know what you didn’t know. There is nothing that makes your first month at a company more miserable than sitting in an office unable to do any work because no one has set up your access to things or even pointed you at any documentation. I have endured this on a couple occasions on-site. Remote onboarding does require both a checklist and a “shepherd” – a person to help you get access and to help troubleshoot issues. Same, I quit a job after a year because I was never trained or taught. After the first week they said “figure it out”, and I never did, despite being in the office 5 days a week. The company culture struggled massively with learning and development and they knew it–even pre-COVID! So this can’t be the main reason to force people to sit in an office all day. The answer has to be more nuanced and more case-by-case. Personal and professional development isn’t a compelling enough reason for you? (genuinely asking) I have a junior employee who asked me for a list of all active employees in the company and their location for a project. This employee doesn’t have the access to pull all the employees including senior level in each area so I sent it. I sent an Excel spreadsheet. The reply? “I thought you were going to send me separate lists for each department.” Um. I sent you the most filterable list format on the planet. But getting this employee to THINK instead of expecting others to do it for them is… not fun. This employee fully WFH? Oh goodness. I am to put it mildly skeptical of RTO requirements and question whether a rigid/blanket policy makes sense for most businesses, but it’s odd that the CEO has made this clear and it isn’t happening. It’s no surprise the staff is not returning to work when it seems the LW as a senior leader is making their dislike of the policy clear, and there seem to be no consequences for people simply refusing to come in. Alison is right, LW needs to make their case about this policy clear in discussion with the CEO, but once the CEO makes the decision that is it, it’s part of LW’s job to implement the policy and it’s apparent they are not doing that at all. I don’t buy these excuses from the staff, they simply don’t want to commute (incidentally maybe the fact that they have “nonstop meetings” to look forward to on arrival is a factor?). Multiple sick pets is up there with “the dog ate my homework” for juvenile excuses. If this has to happen, make it happen. Refusal to come in means warnings, repeat offense means ineligibility for raises and/or dismissal. At this point it seems you are saying “we tried nothing, and THAT didn’t work. What else can we possibly do!?”. The point that’s interesting to me in this letter is less about which format we each like and more about the ability for the leadership of private companies to choose their strategy. Doesn’t the CEO get to pick how he wants to run his business in this case? If it doesn’t work for a lot of the staff and they leave, and the company has a hard time finding new staff, that will be the business outcome of the CEO’s decision. A competing company might be going the other direction. When front-line staff and mid-level management deliberately oppose the corporate mandate, I think it causes trouble. I completely agree and that’s why I end up at “just call the question already!” Get on the table what’s going to happen and how it’s going to be enforced and let it play out however it’s going to play out; staying in this tense limbo is just prolonging things. I think this is a great point. I totally get why people might prefer to work from home, why it would be upsetting to be told you have to come in when you’d rather not, or even why someone might refuse to stay in a job that requires in-office work. But I’m always puzzled by the levels of extreme outrage!!! that we see anytime a company requires workers to come in. Company owners/management are allowed to make these decisions, even if they’re bad decisions, and workers are allowed to find a new job if they think it’s unreasonable. Unfortunately it’s not so easy to find a new job these days. Sorry, but if your workers overwhelmingly prefer one work mode over the other, it makes more sense for the CEO to compromise. Corporations and executives already have so much power over workers’ lives–this is one area where they should be willing to give. But of course I was so fed up with this kind of thing that I decided to work for myself. The CEO DoD “compromise” on three days in office per week. Having been given an inch, LW decided to take a mile. She “compromised” further by unilaterally deciding that two days was sufficient. The CEO’s decision to end it altogether would be a natural consequence of this “gimme an inch, I’ll take a mile” attitude. Unfortunately, many good employees don’t care for an organizational culture that treats them like wayward children. And many bosses don’t care for a workforce who’re behaving like wayward children. Your point? The CEO did compromise. A lot of people are very inertia-driven when it comes to changing jobs, and will invest a ton of energy into trying to change a bad job rather than looking for a new one. For some people it’s for very good reasons — like there not being a lot of opportunities in their field or in this location, or having a salary / benefits / lifestyle factors that would be really hard to meet elsewhere — but sometimes it really is just an irrational belief that you Can’t Leave because [quitting is bad / I owe them something / job seeking is scary]. Personally I have never stayed in a job longer than 3 years and am very comfortable job-seeking, so it’s a mindset I don’t really get! But it is absolutely a real thing, and there are often some quite strong responses when people suggest that LWs start jobsearching. But workers are also allowed to complain and try to change the minds of managers. And sometimes that works. I was at an org at one point that was talking about moving my team to a less-convenient location. There was a resounding response of “if you do this, we will leave.” They did not do it. And that was better for everyone then if they’d done it and the team had quit. The problem is that’s not what the employees did. If they actually did get together and say “we’re not doing this for X reasons [list of reasons that are beneficial for the company]”, they would have had some power. “We have to take international calls – these are just as easily done from home as from the office, and results in X% fewer calls having issues because someone got caught in traffic” is a business case. Instead they just…didn’t come in. But if people have moved further away during the WFH period, you at least need to give them lead time to consider/try to moving back closer to the office (and to try to negotiate for whatever raise is now needed to make it feasible to live close enough to commute). Sounds like the CEO just tried to yank everyone back into the office without sufficient time to adapt, and everyone dug in in response, resulting in this battle. And like others have said, the CEO needs to recognize the pay cut associated with forcing people back into the office. Upper management needed a plan for how to handle these obstacles and costs involved in returning to the office, instead of just a mandate that ignored practicalities. Yeah, call the question, set the firm in-office date for n months out, then start negotiating where needed. And prepare for some people (possibly your highest performers) to quit. It’s not really a pay cut if these jobs were never intended to be remote, but only went remote temporarily because of Covid. It would be more logical to consider that the Covid period was a bonus. Everyone was rightly infuriated at employers who made people come in during the pandemic. The vast majority of employers who did the right thing and allowed people to go remote never promised that it was a permanent arrangement. No, it’s still a pay cut. If it was only six months, it might be a temporary bonus. But after three or four years, it’s a change in effective pay. People get salty about effective pay cuts. This sounds like a recipe for losing a lot of good employees. Already people are struggling with workload, working till 11, burning out, and the CEO still thinks it’s not enough? Their way or the highway is more important? I don’t care if the CEO is right. They can be right all they want, but they will never, ever achieve what they want: a functional office with good employees. Honestly, everyone should start looking to jump ship. There is no hope here–put your energy where it counts: somewhere else. +1 although sadly I think we’re now heading for a crunch where more and more employers feel confident demanding complete RTO because there’s fewer places for employees to jump ship – particularly if they moved out to remote areas and only accept *fully* remote work. If most of the Federal workforce goes back … One thing I really like about DOGE is its policy of requiring the federal workforce to return to office. The NYT had a story about a librarian – a librarian! – at the Library of Congress who was aghast that she couldn’t work remotely forever from Ohio. Why should the federal government be subsidizing waste like this? If this was the CNN story, it wasn’t a librarian and they didn’t have an office to return to. https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/politics/doge-remote-work-federal-employees/index.html She says she doesn’t have an office to return to because someone else moved into her space. So find her some other space. Problem solved. And it’s the height of arrogance to assume they’d hold the same space for her while she spent five years working from Ohio. You are complaining about someone who is -not a librarian-, that is, who has a job that can be done from home, who was told her job was remote, who does not want to move, and who is also pointing out there isn’t an office for her to go back to. (A problem that may be solvable, but is certainly not solvable by her.) IMO, providing an office, or even just a desk space, to someone who can do their job effectively from home is a waste of taxpayer funds. In-office, one-size-fits-all mandates are the height of inefficiency and waste. Do you think that librarians’ duties are limited to stamping the books when someone checks one out and reshelving the books when someone returns one? If you really want to identify waste in the federal government, you might read this: https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-open-letter-doge. I’ll quote: “Simply put: If you [DOGE] ’re trying to identify wasteful practices and spending by federal agencies, you’ll find a wealth of actionable issues that our [ProPublica’s] reporting has surfaced over the past 16 years.” I’ll take the word of actual entrepreneurs like Musk and Vivek who have built actual companies over pro publica Musk drove Twitter/X into the ground, and Tesla is also having issues, so not exactly a great example. Ah yes, what could possibly go wrong with Musk (who didn’t actually build any of his companies, he bought the majority of shares in existing companies) steering the federal workforce ship! Begging you to actually learn who Musk is. My goodness. Musk is not an entrepreneur. He comes in after a company has been started, pushes out the founders, and then takes credit for it. Quite frankly, the idea of running the government “like a business” is asinine. The closest would be a non-profit, not a for profit company. Those who advocate for the government to be run like a for-profit business understand neither government or business. How has this point been completely derailed by a news story you got wrong? My original point still stands, no matter how many exceptions to the rule are found. Why do you assume it’s waste? I don’t think most librarians spend the bulk of their time shelving physical books. If anything, it could be a cost save because Ohio is unquestionably cheaper than DC. 100%! Especially because most civilian federal agencies provide region-based pay, which means that employees in OH will almost certainly be paid less than those in similar, DC-based roles. Allowing remote work DOES save the government money. You lost any smidge of credibility you might’ve had by saying that. Yikes. Where do you get remote = waste? Whereas I think DOGE will be a complete and utter farce. Why should the taxpayers pay for office real estate that is not needed? Just so some oligarch can see butts in seats slaving away? No, that’s downright stupid. If the work can be effectively done without requiring office space, then to save the taxpayers money it should be remote. Especially in cities, office space can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 per employee per year. Multiply that by the size of the federal workforce that can do their jobs remotely, and that’s not a small amount. I don’t want my taxpayer money wasted on frivolous in-office mandates from unelected oligarchs like Musk and Ramaswamy. Hell, I don’t want it wasted on mandates from elected officials who are just changing things to look like they are “doing something” about “government waste”, especially when their “doing something” costs more money! “This sounds like a recipe for losing a lot of good employees. ” When I saw the justification of “Well, Amazon is doing it” my first thought was “Yes, they’re hoping people quit so that they can reduce their workforce by attrition rather than layoffs.” I don’t know if that’s what’s happening with LW’s company; their CEO could be clueless or just really committed to in-office work. But I think five years into WFH becoming a super common thing, we should be really skeptical about mandates for being in the office five days per week for jobs that are predominately done on the computer or from a smart phone. When I saw the justification of “Well, Amazon is doing it,” that told me everything I needed to know about the CEO. Yeah, he’s a cargo-cult MBA CEO without an original thought in his head, just stuff from business school ten years ago or more. These people run businesses into the ground. A question I keep asking and no one ever really answers. All these companies with RTO mandates. Employees want to be fully remote, not hybrid, so there are resignations after the RTO mandates. What are all these folks going to do if they can’t find a fully remote position? It seems the fully remote positions are much fewer than a couple of years ago. Will they very grudgingly take a remote or in office position and plot their exit as soon as they can find something else? What if they jump ship for a remote position that turns out to be hybrid or fully in office? Yeah I do wonder about this. Sigh. At least I got to witness the brief moment of history where it seemed like workers had the upper hand for a moment. Nice while it lasted. I think some of it is just geography & commute. If I was working in Manhattan, but then went remote and moved far away, and then subsequently refused to RTO on 42nd street, I might not be opposed to an in-office role that’s an easy 10 minute drive away in Whereversville where I live now. I’m guessing some find remote positions (possibly at a pay cut or other loss, but if remote work is important enough to them, it could be worth it), and others find in-person or hybrid roles that suit their needs better (shorter commute, closer to their daycare, more flexible on medical appointments, earlier or later work hours, more PTO, a role they’re excited enough about to be worth the sacrifice, etc). Yes! There are lots of alternatives that aren’t either “this existing job/fully remote” or “this existing job, fully in the office.” I work for the government and my agency gave up the leases on a bunch if budings this year. The career people definitely don’t want us back in the office. The incoming political types keep saying they’re going to push it. Who knows what will happen, but RTO would cost millions just in the leases. This!! It is a waste of taxpayer money to lease office space that is not actually needed because the work can be done remotely. There’s been a lot of “well, I was thinking I’d work another couple years before retiring, but I guess I’ll be done now” and people who would be fine with any of remote/hybrid/in-office but who have moved and moving or commuting back to their current employer isn’t happening. Where I work, we’ve always (before C19) been mainly in-office but with some people 100% remote and with an option for occasional WFH, so we’re used to being flexible. If someone who was a reliable employee wanted to go remote I can’t imagine management saying no. Yes, it’s very empowering to be able to say “please don’t make me retire” For me personally, I was able to successfully argue I had no reason to go back to an office, my entire team is spread across the US. But I also keep my eyes open for other remote options and there’s still a lot out there, even if competition is fierce. I keep wondering this too but don’t voice it because people think it’s an opinion (WFH is bad) rather than just a fact that we’re in a white collar recession. The threat to get another job has zero weight when most places aren’t hiring unless you’re an insanely knowledgeable Accountant or whiz coder. Most of the jobs being created the past six months are food service/hospitality, school jobs, home health aids, etc. I can tell you where I’d go if it happened to me. I take my knowledge and skills to my company’s competitor for around of 50% raise. I might have to go in the office two or three times a week but at least I’d be getting paid for it. and my competitor would be getting some pretty key knowledge that would help advance their competitiveness by about 5 to 10 years in the span of just a few weeks. I don’t think the fully remote positions are much fewer than, say, late 2022, after the pandemic had mostly died down. According to nearly all data sources, work from home shot up between 2019 and 2022, then dropped in 2022 and has more or less been steady since then. But it still WAY higher than it was in 2019 and shows no sign of returning to those levels. I do think there is a concerted effort in business-focused media to enforce the narrative that RTO must happen and working from home must end and that of course every company is going along with that. It’s just not the actual reality, across the board. You’ve got companies that do it, like the one here. But there’s a whole lot of twisted wish-fulfillment-type thinking in business media about this topic. Not so much in my experience though. Still plenty of fully remote jobs, and businesses that are starting up are choosing work from home because it’s a huge cost savings. We just haven’t been in much of an environment for many businesses to start up in. As someone with maybe a paralyzing fear of job searching, thank you for sharing this. It’s like a sunbeam. I just keep thinking, why quit for a job forcing you back if they’re all forcing you back? The trend seems overwhelming. It actually isn’t. The big ego-driven companies with celebrity CEOs are doing it as a flex of their power. The others that are following like lemmings have cargo-cult management. If it was me? I’d grudgingly take a hybrid role, and look to bail as soon as a fully remote role opened up. I loathe open-plan offices, since companies are too cheap to even provide the partial privacy of cubicles anymore, but are still too spendthrift to embrace the reduced costs gained from 100% remote. I despise spending an hour or more commuting each way to sit in a pool of desks with noisy people around me. I get irritated when people see me in person and make judgements about my cane, my limp, and my non-functional, right arm. I seethe at the idea that I need to risk my family’s health due to all of the people who work sick and act as super spreaders of every germ they’ve ever met. I’ve watched lots of people leave the bathroom straight from the stall without washing their hands. They’ll likely do one of couple things: Find a job where the office environment is more pleasant. My current office hub is pretty darn miserable. No available food options, coffee machine is terrible, it’s in a rough part of town, it’s freezing cold all the time, no amenities, and like many people who WFH with a scattered workforce, I wind up on Zoom calls with people all over the US and offshore while sitting in a “hotelling” cube that I can’t personalize or even count on day to day. Find a new job with a pay raise that makes up for the cost of RTO. Find a job that’s more flexible, but not 100% WFH. Find a job with a shorter commute. Patch together freelance, UE and other income sources while holding out for the job they want. Drop out of the workforce to be a SAHP or SAHS (parent/spouse) or pursue a passion project. You owe it to your team to keep them informed so that they can make an educated choice. If they don’t want to show up to the office anyway, that’s their business. Likewise, if they decide to say give one person their key cards and have them sign everyone in each day, that’s also their business. Your job is just to make sure they understand that such behavior can have consequences. When talking to your team, I’d try to emphaise that this mandate isn’t coming from you but rather your bosses and there’s nothing you can do about it. Your employees will still be upset, but you don’t want to get in an argument with them about a policy you can’t change. This is like telling your children it is okay to cheat on a test. It is your business if you try and cheat and game the system. If I knew of employees coffee swiping they would deal with HR and if someone took everyones badges and did it they would most likely be fired. How people don’t see this as a judgment issue I will never understand. Also an FYI, you realize places have cameras right? And companies are also monitoring systems not just card swipes anymore? The time to discuss it was when the CEO mandated 3 days. Instead of skirting the policy OP should have spoken with the CEO with other leaders and maybe asked for 2 days in office or something like that. But honestly how everyone is reacting is probably going to cause a RTO 5 days and less flexibility. My partner has been going back for years but he is allowed to give his team flexibility. There are periods they must be in 4 days (forward facing), but periods that are slower or if someone has an emergency or is sick but can work they stay home (or use their lots of sick leave). But they earned it and showed that when the 3 day mandate came in they did it and they work hard. If I were the CEO I dont know if I could trust people who felt they could just do what they wanted and not follow the policy. If you are loosing clients and having layoffs then there is clearly an issue with working remote and maybe the CEO is trying to help the business/ stop layoffs. Precisely I could be wrong, but I don’t think Parenthesis Guy is suggesting that the LW do a “wink wink nudge nudge” thing with respect to the card swiping. I think he’s saying the LW should stop worrying about how their employees are going to continue to try to get around the policy, and focus on making sure they understand that the policy is the policy and if they don’t follow it, there will be consequences. My general sense of the letter is that the LW is hung up too much on their employees’ feelings, because they themselves don’t like or agree with the policy which makes it more difficult for them to communicate/enforce it. I mean if the policy was “Everyone needs to start using these special pens” and the reason was because it turns out all other pens are somehow rendered explosive in their office then the LW could easily say “I don’t care how special your pink feather pen is to you, you could kill us all if you don’t use these Pilot G-2 07 ones.” LW isn’t going to feel bad about that at all. But telling people they need to come into the office x days a week no matter what just because the CEO says so just… kindof sucks. So Parenthesis Guy is saying to just disconnect and focus on communicating the policy and the fact that there are going to be consequences if they don’t follow it. There’s a lot of wrong assumptions with your message (I’m the LW). I won’t write a big reply why since I’m replying late to these messages so I don’t anyone will really see them, but just wanted to have that clearly written here :) So, you think this manager has no responsibility to actually… manage the staff? Honestly this “see no evil, hear no evil” idea would make Sergeant Schultz of Hogan’s Heroes an ideal. “I see NOTHINK!” There’s a big difference between managing your staff to do their work and managing your staff to come in three days a week when you don’t care. If the CEO makes you in charge of determing who is coming up, then that’s a different story. Eh, it’s the job of a manager to generally enforce the rules. If a manager is that opposed to a rule and hasn’t had success in changing their own manager’s mind on it, it’s time to move on. Idk. Enforcing a rule seems like decidedly her business. It will reflect poorly on her as a people manager, and I don’t think she should risk her professional reputation so they can feel autonomy in their protest (at least not with greater consideration to the risks to her career). To be clear, I don’t agree with the CEO’s decision given what’s been share, but it’s his bad decision to make and hers to communicate and enforce. And enforcement means not turning a blind eye to noncompliance. She can decide how much time and resources she dedicates to this, but she can’t decide (without consequences) to just not do it. This is literally just part of being a manger, unfortunately. Err yes. As a manager I am responsible for enforcing the rules of the company. If I think a rule is really stupid I will challenge it discreetly or suggest alternatives and sometimes they’re adopted. But I don’t get to decide not to do my job which involves ensuring compliance with the rules. If I didn’t want to have to manage people and ensure rules are followed, I wouldn’t be in a management role. He’s their manager. It’s absolutely his business. I’m a GM. If my employee took everyone else’s keycards and swiped for them while I just kept saying “there are consequences,” guess who gets fired first? Me. And I’d deserve it for not managing. I’m curious – and frankly, a little concerned – about the “international calls from 8 am to noon” and the unspecified other reasons why OP’s team might be swapping days. How were those handled in the before times? If those weren’t a big deal pre-COVID, then I think it weakens OP’s case to bring them up – they become excuses, not reasons. If the nature of the work has changed – there are a lot more of these calls because new customers/offshoring/etc., then it is a valid thing to bring up. But it should start w/ the business needs, because that is what CEO is focused on. Since when is having to start at 8AM and work for four hours is a compelling case against working in the office? Other aspects of this workplace (working until 11?! Nonstop meetings?!) are more salient. If you have kids to get to school and a long commute, getting to the office by eight can be tricky to impossible, while simply taking those calls from home presents no difficulty. Perhaps followed by coming into the office for the afternoon, if there is some actual point to this. Having to be in an office by 7:45 to zoom someone across the world means you have to get properly dressed and commute during rush hour. Maybe you also need to get your kids to childcare or pay for early dropoff hours. Being able to take that call from home means you don’t need to get fully dressed or commute during rush hour, and have more time to deal with dependents and get ready before your 8am call. And it doesn’t matter to your coworkers either way, because you’re not talking to them in person regardless. I think the thing here is that it is silly to commute into the office to then close your office door to get on video calls with people who are *not* in your office. If you are coming in to the office to work with coworkers there, then the international call-heavy day isn’t the best day for that. Exactly. My team is in other sites, people in my projects are on other sites and making me go to the office for 4 days just to be in Zoom calls or work by myself just doesn’t make any sense. I have no collaboration on site and I find it frustrating that this is obviously not taken into account. And the changes and improvements in technology for calls etc. in the last 5-6 years are CRAZY – the ease and quality of video calls is so much better, and so many more people can actually do it now, that saying “what happened before C-19” is like saying “let’s just do what we did in the 2010s” when we had completely different systems and tools available. It’s like getting rid of email a few years after it became common. “Well you did your work just fine without it before!” is not really an argument. Or trying to make everyone wear suits and ties again. “You used to wear that 5 days a week!” LW: A good chunk of the local people this is affecting were hired during COVID, when we were fully remote, so there’s that! There’s also a lot of assumption in the comments I’ve noticed where it’s assumed the CEO even understands/knows what we do day-to-day and how this type of stuff affects our work. He does not! He does not care I work until 11PM a good chunk of nights. Every middle manager comes upon their opportunity to fight for their staff or to suck up to the execs. The best ones defend their staff, the ones that give in keep their jobs. Nah. There are middle managers all over the place who can go their entire careers without being given a bridge too far. In a healthy workplace you can be the information conduit between your team and your upper management without having to choose sides like this. If you work exclusively in very toxic workplaces, this might be true. I am a middle manager who will fight for my staff, but at a certain point, you have to recognize that the fight is over; otherwise, you’ll harm your reputation and your career. I’ve repeatedly addressed the merits of flexibility and WFH to senior leadership. Our executive team has decided they are against WFH, and I’ve conveyed to my team that I don’t agree with or like the policies but that we have to abide by them. I could list out a million reasons why work from home is a better option to have available rather than requiring all staff to work in the office 5 days a week, but it doesn’t matter here. It sounds like LW is a senior leader at their company. A senior leader’s job is to champion the direction the CEO wants to take the company. That doesn’t mean you have to agree with it, can’t fight the battle behind the scenes, or that you should gaslight your employees into thinking it was the right decision. But LW needs to be enforcing the CEO’s decisions and making sure staff are compliant with the rules. It sounds like this wasn’t happening before and therefore the CEO continued to take more drastic measures. It sounds like this is settled in your CEO’s mind–he wants people in office, he compromised on a hybrid setup but people kept acting like they worked remotely, so he’s now going to insist on full-time in-office. It sounds like he knows it’s unpopular and doesn’t care. That sucks for anyone on your team who relies on a WFH setup (whether for childcare reasons, a bad commute, medical appointments, or just personal preference). But it shouldn’t be a surprise–not after 3 years of being told to be in office more and more often. The only open question is, what consequences will actually be enforced about it? I’m betting your CEO already knows if he’s willing to fire people over noncompliance. And I bet your team members already know if they’re willing to quit over this. If you can feel out the answers to those questions, that might be useful information for your planning. I’m curious about consequences too. Does the CEO want managers to go through the performance management process that may eventually result in firing? What if a top performer keeps flouting the in-person requirement? “What if a top performer keeps flouting the in-person requirement?“ Then you address that on a case by case basis. Truly top performers can write their own ticket. But few people will get to be top performers (particularly in leadership roles) by isolating themselves at home. Your CEO isn’t seeing the big picture. Or any picture, for that matter. This “my way or the highway” attitude is a sure-fire recipe for already-disgruntled employees (Working until 11 pm and then having to be all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed next morning? Yikes!) to find greener pastures. And for what? To see butts in seats in an office? Just because that’s the way it worked in past, doesn’t make it work today or tomorrow. If you *need* to rehash out the arguments with your staff again, I would focus on triaging. Who really needs an exception and will quit immediately otherwise, and who is just hoping to keep this because it’s nice? For example, you mention some of your team are working out-of-norm hours because of international partners, is it even logistically possible for them to be in their office-seats for those calls? Or would your client/partner calls need to be rescheduled to allow for them to commute as required? Do you lose a top performer who moved farther away and has daycare/school limitations so there’s no way they’ll finish their big project? If you can pick out the points where it’s a real obvious inconvenience for the company to fight with you, you might get the actual exceptions you need (at the expense of the others, of course). Right now you’re fighting too many battles all at once, which just makes your team seem intransigent. Pick the best ones and you have a shot of winning where you really need to. I have a hard time understanding how people who are hired full time on-site (versus remote) have a hard time going in to the office. Like, it’s no surprise, right? Hedonic adaptation. It’s a thing in psychology & economics. You get a new enjoyable thing that you weren’t expecting. After a surprisingly short amount of time, it’s painful to give that thing up, you expect that thing as a given in your life, and you get indignant if you can’t have it. Especially if there doesn’t seem to be a real reason for giving it up. This. I worked five days a week in the office pre-pandemic, though I was definitely considering asking for one WFH day per week even before 2020. Now, being in the office even three days per week is immensely painful. My job can be done 100% from the computer, and my collaboration with my colleagues actually works better via Teams than it does in person for the kind of work that I do. All that is to say that while obviously I did five days a week five years ago, my philosophy has shifted in that time. My approach to work and understanding how my job functions and how it relates to my colleagues underwent a dramatic change five years ago; I don’t think it’s surprising in the slightest that I would want a change from my 2019 status quo. What I’ve learned in the past three years or so is that a lot of people apparently didn’t undergo the same kinds of changes, which is fine but surprising to me. You make a key point, Lisa! The REASON makes a huge difference. Make it meaningful or leave it alone. I mean, it’s been five years since the Covid WFH mandates. That’s a very substantial amount of time for the new normal to have established itself and for people’s lives to have moulded around it. If someone had come along in 2001 and told you you had to go back to Windows 3.1, or taken away your smartphone in 2014 — would you have been indignant? Or would you have completely easily gone back to the way things were five years earlier? I also used to make a third of my current salary, doesn’t mean I’d be happy to go back to it. It sounds like OP’s company has been working remote or hybrid since the pandemic. That’s like 4 years at this point. I’m sure plenty of people were hired during that time frame, for what was at the time a remote or hybrid role, and is now being converted to in-person for the first time. I was hired a couple years before the pandemic and they basically said “you can come in if you really want (to a mostly empty office) but hardly anyone does” and my boss was in another state anyways. We’re still all in different states but we have to commute into our offices. You’re continuing to try to give your employees flexibility, but it seems kinder to let them know that they don’t really have flexibility here. Then they can decide what to do – look for a new job, move closer, whatever. I think people might feel like, okay, another false alarm. They said we’d have to come in, but we don’t really. Yes! It’s great to advocate for your staff, but it’s incredibly important to be honest with them. They should have a realistic understanding of the expectations of their jobs, and make their own choices from there. Yeah, it can actually be more stressful to staff when the expectations aren’t clear. I’m retired now, so no longer have kin in the game, but I know that my last employer told us March 9, 2020 to go home and stay home until further notice. That setup worked fine for years. I worked in software development and support — so face to face contact wasn’t really necessary, but it is good to be in the office occasionally, because the dynamic of an in-person meeting is different than a Zoom call. But if I come into the office and spend eight hours in front of a computer, why am I even coming into the office? IMO, a good solution would be for people to come into the office 1-2 days a week. That should be enough face time to keep things going smoothly, while retaining most of the WFH convenience. I know I was thrilled to not have to spend an hour and a half commuting each day, plus buying or bringing my lunch. Good luck! Reading the letter one of the main things sticking out for me seems to be that from top with CEO through middle/junior management in case of LW there doesn’t seem to be any proper either feedback being supplied up why policy not working or proper notification down that this is what needs to happen. Different departments deciding to pick and choose what to do after the first requests and then not following up with employees is causing this Laissez-faire attitude to it and people feel that the request either doesn’t need followed or doesn’t apply to them. Unfortunately now it’s going to create an impasse, but feels like some more direct management and decision making at beginning could have stopped getting to this stage. Unfortunately for normal employees it’s going to cause the most impact as they’ll need to decide if they want to continue in job with hybrid commitment or find elsewhere. Particularly those that moved away from being local to office. Would be curious about the communication with staff at point of starting being remote whether they were given impression it would be permanent or not. Given what seems to be lack of communication elsewhere, I wouldn’t be surprised if they felt was new conditions going forward. All in all though a complete mess for all involved… I do think it’s a problem for a company to be largely remote when the top leadership doesn’t understand how to run a remote company. I know people here are firmly WFH and don’t see how anyone could think otherwise, but a functional remote company doesn’t just happen. Leadership sets up systems and processes that make it work. It has to be deliberate and intentional to be sustainable. And I say this as someone who works fully remote for an organization that has always been remote. I felt we were well set up, but then we went some major changes to our systems and the organization has been floundering. It feels way less effective because leadership is no longer being deliberate about how to make it work. It’s incredibly frustrating; I’m trying to care, but the lack of oversight means it’s extremely tempting to just take advantage of the fact that no one is paying attention. Obviously people slack off in offices, but it’s a lot easier with remote work unless you have systems. It sounds like a problem that people moved away. That was a gamble they took. Yes, you might lose good people, but they might lose their job. They made that choice when they moved even though WFH was an emergency measure that leadership didn’t fully buy into. Regardless of what way this goes, clarity around expectations and setting up systems that actually work for whatever structure you go with is key. But that’s all on the CEO. This being said, the more I’m thinking about this the more pissed I’d be if I were the CEO. I made my expectations clear, and my middle management undermined me. It sounds like there are plenty of reasons this company isn’t that well run (working till 11pm?), but in a functional company you implement the processes that leadership wants and if there are problems with them you work in an iterative process to refine them. You don’t just be like, “Oh, CEO says this but I don’t like it so I’ll be really lax about it for years.” I think a lot of orgs definitely don’t know how to run a remote company, but I think that’s a bit of a red herring given how many of them don’t know how to run in-person companies either. Communication dysfunction, inability to keep on top of what staff are working on, making sure that people are productive, etc. were all recurring themes in letters published on this site pre-2020. Good companies don’t happen by magic, and bad management can certainly exacerbate the challenges of being remote, but I don’t think “Well, companies are bad at this!” is a reason for a company not to be remote. But if the CEO, the leader of the company, doesn’t want to learn how to run a remote company, that’s his choice? It’s not like a leader just suddenly has the skills and knowledge to run a remote company — those are skills they need to actually develop. It seems like people think there’s no difference, but there’s a huge difference and a steep learning curve. If leadership is like, “I am not interested in learning how to set up a well-run remote company and feel we’re most effective with facetime,” then he gets to make that decision. And if the middle management wants to fight for remote/hybrid, they should be focusing on what his concerns are about remote work and proposing systems that alleviate those concerns. This is also just intuition, but I also think that someone who’s not great at running a company is probably able to make it work a bit better in person than remotely, partly probably due to their comfort with the systems they came up in. Frankly there are other details in that make me think this isn’t a very well run company, there are clearly huge communication issues, and honestly hybrid is probably somewhat contributing to that. But the super long work days alone are a flashing red flag. He absolutely gets to make that decision, but that’s not what your top-level comment was about so I didn’t think it was necessary to address that. “But some companies are dysfunctional in any format” also really didn’t address the meat of what I was saying either, though. I actually really am not sure what your response had to do with my comment. My point is that running a company remotely requires specific skills and decisions, which is a reality that I rarely see commenters take into consideration when advocating for remote work. I think we’re just talking past each other, so I’ll leave it there. Personally, this long drawn out ambiguity and drama would drive me bonkers regardless of topic. Whatever the CEO chooses, and however the employees choose to react, there will be consequences. So just make the decision and see what the consequences are and then deal with them and move on. Maybe everyone quits. Maybe they don’t. Only one way to find out! I’m a manager, and I HATE hybrid. As far as I am concerned, it’s the worst of both worlds. (For context, I worked all-remote for most of the pandemic, then hybrid, then all-in-person, and now back to hybrid). All remote, people were in “remote mode” and stuff got done because that was the only way! Moreover, as a manager, my talent pool went wayyyy up because I could hire from anywhere across the country. All in-person, okay, it was largely back to the way things were pre-pandemic. Same old, same old. Hybrid? Setting aside the actual work schedule/ethic since that varies by employee and office culture, the system just isn’t set up to accommodate remote work as well as it was when we were all remote. Computer’s acting up? IT will tell you to bring it in on your next in-office day, and you’re fiddling until then. Don’t have a deep pool of people with the specialized skill set you need in the local area? Too bad, you can’t hire from further away because you can’t reasonably ask them to commute a four-hour flight 4 days a week. I work 100% remotely now and have for about a decade, but I’ve been working hybrid since the mid90s. It’s not as cut and dried as you portray, at least not in a functional company. Many, many companies have had successful hybrid environments for decades. I work 100% remotely for medical reasons and I now work at a company that’s 100% remote, but when I was physically capable, I found hybrid was often the best option (for me, 1-2 days onsite, 3-4 remote is perfect). Some of it depends on the specific tasks – quiet focused time can be difficult in a cube farm or open office, for example. Research showed that 80% of CEOs regretted forcing return to office policies. The ones that did it well actually worked with employees to make it manageable. The ones that regretted it used top-down ultimatums and found themselves faced with mass resignations. As other people have pointed out, the ones that have in-demand skills will be the first to go. The real question is, what is productivity like? If it has stayed stable or increased since WFH started, then forcing RTO with no corresponding increase in wages or benefits is going to be perceived as purely ego-driven and punitive and staff who can find other jobs will flee. This is exactly what commenters are missing. The issue about the pro and con of RTO vs hybrid vs WFH. The issue is the lack of clarity and facts about RTO in general and for this LW’s organization. Everyone has *opinions* about the so called mandate. There is no clear direction from the CEO who apparently is him/herself working from wishes and wants vs. facts and apparently little guidance on communicating the mandate and consequences for ignoring it. Get that, LW, and since you have skin in this game, get data and plan to mitigate impacts. Demand clarity, whichever way it goes. (Northwestern Mutual has entered the chat) Say what? Record earnings when they were completely WFH but still demanding RTO. Senior VP had some snarky comment about how people would have to do laundry on weekends instead of during workday. Always fascinating to wonder what research people are referring to when they say “research shows”! Enter “80% of CEOs regretted forcing return to office policies” in your preferred search engine and you’ll get a CNBC article of the same name from 2023, which links to the research within the body of the article. Amen. Seems like at the very least, the company should be getting what they “asked for”. Go to the office for your 8-5, take your actual lunchbreak, then go home. Don’t work until 11 pm, take your sick days and personal days, carve back some of that time creep that remote work allowed. And support your staff in this too. 100% this. Leadership doesn’t get to force RTO because “that’s the way it used to be” while also expecting the early morning or late-night work. I also work in a large international organization. Fortunately, our current CEO is not rigid in the ways described here. Unfortunately, I could see that changing depending on how US federal remote work policies change under Trump, because the US government is a major funder of our work. One thing I detect in this letter and in other international organizations with rigid in-office work requirements is an expectation of flexibility from staff without concomitant flexibility offered by the organization. Many US-based staff in international orgs start their work days between 6-8a to be available for calls with colleagues in other offices. Would this CEO agree to a policy where no US staf take calls before 9a Tues-Thursday? I think it’s very unlikely as that would not be in the interest of the organization. I agree with Alison on all these points! It’s the CEO’s call, but if they don’t enforce it, few are going to do it and those who do will be annoyed that so many others don’t. I’m in an office that is a long commute for me, where they literally don’t have enough desks or seats for everyone, and many were working remote before the pandemic (I started remote during the pandemic shutdown.) They also have way too few conference rooms and phone booths so people are shouting over one another on calls at the crowded desks. Yet every year or so they make some announcement that they want people to return to office, unless they were hired remote, or they live far away, or their manager allows them to stay remote, or they are feeling sick but not too sick to work… There are so many exceptions that it’s just annoying. I basically go to the office when I have rare meetings with someone who is in the office, otherwise I work at home because it makes more sense and I get more done. I wonder about the discussion on RTO: if a job can be 100% remote, what prevents it from being offshored or downgraded in pay? Why should I pay Manhattan rates if I can hire someone in Wyoming for less? While talent may be hard to find and could leave, the option of going into the office might become a key advantage for employees in the future. Additionally, those who dismiss the need for mentoring often overlook that layoffs can force someone to move companies. Not knowing who handles tasks in accounting highlights the benefits of being in the office. Many who excel at WFH have already gained momentum and can rely less on in-office benefits. Well, more people live on the island of Manhattan than in the entire state of Wyoming, so while in theory that works there’s a reason people pay NY rates. All kinds of hypotheticals work but not every notion pans out. No one’s dismissing the need for mentoring, but lots of people are saying it needs to be deliberate and structured, rather than haphazard and on the fly. If you don’t know who handles the tasks in accounting, that’s an issue of bad onboarding, absent process documents, and/or lack of documentation in staff manuals. It’s not because you weren’t sitting in an office. I have an ongoing job manual that I keep up to date and it always includes page detailing colleagues on other teams that I interact with, for what purpose, and how often so that when I eventually move on, the person after me knows exactly who to talk to and about what. It doesn’t have to be some unknowable mystery. Something that comes screaming through this letter is that the LW doesn’t want to RTO him/herself. I’d be shocked if their employees haven’t picked up on that and figured “Hey! LW is one of us! They probably won’t push back if we push the RTO policy to the limit. After all, they don’t like coming in, either”. Time to change that. As mentioned upthread, the CEO gets to make this call and it’s the LW’s job to enforce the new RTO mandate. It’s time for LW to stop ALL commiserating with their reports on this subject, and figure out how to implement that which the CEO has commanded from on high. When people know that their manager doesn’t like a policy, they feel more emboldened to push the boundaries of that policy. I’d also suggest thinking through ahead of time what constitutes an acceptable WFH day when it’s Tuesday – Thursday, and what does not, and talk that through with your team. Be completely frank – something like: “WFH on designated office days is allowed occasionally for life’s little emergencies like letting in a repairman or staying home when you feel a little under the weather. However, please know that WFH mid-week should be the unusual exception, not something you’re doing with any regularity. That vast majority of the time, I expect to see you in-office every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday unless you’re taking PTO”. Funny enough, LW here, I wasn’t the problem. My boss and I supervise everyone. Pre recent layoffs, it was 3 of us (another director). The other director unfortunately got let go and he absorbed her people (like +3). So he directly supervises the majority of people. HIS people were the ones not following the mandate the most at first. So the less he pushed his people, when he’s ABOVE me, the more I got confused how enforceable should I even be. Funny how that works typing that out now! Because also, outside my boss, despite me making my feelings known on the mandate, I follow it the most :) I’d often be alone in the office til EOD. I read an article about a recent return to the office mandate (I don’t remember if it was Amazon or not), and the comments the employees left on the Slack announcement. Many of the featured comments in this particular article were about not being able to come into the office due to not having child care and WFH making child care easier. Traditionally, aside from the pandemic and the random sick day, you aren’t supposed to have kids at home when you WFH full-time(I learned that here on AAM). And honestly, I’m not surprised we are seeing more strict in-office mandates. Exactly. I learned about the pre-pandemic childcare requirement here as well. If the LW’s workplace is representative of other companies, people are just flouting the in office days and doing what they like. I’m not surprised about the strict in office mandates, either. Like kids in a class, the people who abused the system are making the system worse for those who have been following the rules diligently. A lot of people are still stuck between a rock and a hard place. It’s still very difficult to find affordable childcare in many areas, and in some areas, consistent childcare just isn’t available for very young children. Of course, remote workers should have childcare in place so they can focus on their jobs, but the reality is that that just isn’t an option for everyone. So those folks are stuck in the sense that they can’t afford/access childcare but they still need their jobs. When my husband’s office declared a 2-day-per-week in-office hybrid, he was being slack about attending it. I told him to PLEASE straighten up and follow the mandate, because if people didn’t take it seriously, the CEO was going to get sick of the whole thing and make them 40 hours a week in person. It seems to have worked, people seem to be respecting it, and they’ve remained hybrid. There’s a huge potential for such a policy to be enforced on people that the CEO or some senior manager doesn’t like, and unenforced for the managerial favorites. I think the CEO should be forced to give unequivocal guidelines on how to deal with someone who doesn’t come in often enough, even if this person is totally beloved by all. A blanket policy that doesn’t acknowledge how stressful it is to do 10 PM or 3 AM or even 6 AM calls, and then also have to come into the office just like everyone else for a full day’s work, is wrong, imo. If I have such a call, I consider that a good reason to work from home that day (or the following). If the CEO doesn’t think so, they need to specifically address that point. I read on a forum recently from a person who stated categorically that they cannot return to the office because they will be killed while driving in traffic. That underlined for me one of the reasons I prefer my hybrid schedule. Being at home so much was reducing my resiliency for dealing with the world outside. Just chiming in for those of us who are not devoted to 100% WFH. We’re out here, and we’d love to go for lunch sometime. I work in mental health (I’m a psychiatric NP) and I see people— not a ton, but I’ve seen several— for whom WFH has drastically worsened their issues. “I can’t go back to the office because I’ll be too anxious” is an example. Prior to Covid, there were people who were forced to address their anxiety and learn to function, because they had no other options. Now, there is this option to retreat and hide, and for some people, it is devastating to their functioning. Your word “resiliency” is a succinct way of describing this. Yeah, I like my hybrid a ton. Quite similarly much of my social life (with two young kids) is meeting people for lunch on office days, coworkers or not because I work in Midtown. Yeah, hybrid once a week is perfect for me. I was 100 remote for about 18 months, went sporadically to the office when it was allowed again and have been going regularly for the past 2 years. I’m more productive at home but I enjoy seeing my coworkers. I find that really interesting, though I have the opposite experience. Working from home has increased my resilience to the everyday problems that life throws my way. Because my social battery isn’t drained from being in the office all day and my physical energy isn’t drained from commuting, I have more energy and emotional resources to deal with life. Do people not leave their homes to go places other than work? I truly don’t mean this to be snarky. It’s just so far outside my own experience. I WFH unless I’m doing work travel, but I go to activism-related meetings and protests, I go to the crafts studio where I’m a member, I go running, I volunteer at a food pantry, I go to ethnoreligious events, I go to medical appointments, I go to cafes and restaurants and friends’ homes. I’ve found that not having to deal with a commute and an office helps me deal better with the rest of life like HungryLawyer does, but that one will definitely vary from person to person. If my body hadn’t started throwing pain riots when I went to the office (multiple different reasons/sources), I’d still be willing to go, but I will say that commuting in rush-hour traffic regularly made my overall driving worse until after I stopped having to do it XD How do you separate that from the trauma of living through a global pandemic and being let down by our governments and society? There’s a lot less social trust than there used to be and it’s not due to WFH. I’m not understanding what’s not going great about this process, other than that it’s maybe too slow. Senior management has decided they want to employ a team of people who are willing to work from the office, and currently the company is shaking out who is willing to do that and who is going to leave. Having been involved in a return-to-work process, I’m pretty confident this is exactly what the CEO expected. OP doesn’t like what’s happening. That’s fair. But it’s going about how the company likely expected. A major issue we are facing in my workplace is the cost of maintaining a physical workplace when everyone is on a hybrid work schedule and our office is only significantly occupied 2 days per week. I totally understand why leadership is having trouble figuring out how to balance WFH while also justifying the half million a year our leased space costs. Especially as we are absorbing budget cuts due to changes in our core funding. I see a lot of scorn for CEOs/leadership and their inflexibility, some of which is probably well deserved, but think larger corporations and companies located in high COLAs are probably really struggling with this right now. In many cases it may not be really possible to cut down on space to allow for hybrid work and some cost savings due to the way the building is configured or where it is. And IME, telling people with offices that they work in a couple of days per week that their offices are going away because they aren’t used enough causes the opposite complaint. I don’t know what the right answer is here – I hope hybrid is here to stay and that we and other groups can figure out how to keep enough space to have the opportunity for regular in person meetings (I am so tired of Zoom although it’s so great to have it in the toolbox) while permitting a decent amount of WFH flexibility. Excellent points! It will be interesting to see how these things play out. I’ve seen some places say you have an allocated desk if you’re in 4 days or more, otherwise it’s hotdesking. There may be some reluctance at first but you can’t have it both ways and really, hot desking is fine for most people/roles, as long as you have a locker or storage to keep some things at the office This feels like a version of the sunk cost fallacy. You have a lease, so you’re going to be paying half a million a year whether or not you use the space, so management feels like they have to get their money’s worth, by having people in the office. But the relevant number isn’t that half a million/year: it’s that half a million, minus however much or little you’re spending specifically because people are working from home. An empty office doesn’t cost you more than it would if someone was sitting in there, using a computer or talking on the phone. There may be other reasons for wanting Fergus in the office, depending on the specifics of your work. If so, focus there: you can’t do hands-on lab work remotely, and that would be true even if the lab space was free. In my experience the problem with the leadership mandates is that they fail to clearly communicate what they expect the results to be. They need to provide a general goal that managers can filter and specify for their team’s roles, and that shows leadership understand how business gets done. Otherwise it’s cute that they say they want more collaboration … when teams are geographically dispersed anyhow. Yes, I agree–I think transparency on both sides is really important here. To the team, as Alison says, you can say, “Look, I know you don’t like it, but this decision has come down from the CEO and this is going to be the reality of working here. It is up to you to decide if you are willing to do that.” Likewise, I think it’s also worth telling the CEO, “We will lose people if we stick to this mandate. Are you comfortable with that?” I think WFH is mostly a huge “It Depends.” As someone in Tech: all of my teams are dispersed into multiple geographies. A mandate would mean that I drive to the office to have virtual calls all day long (on worse internet than I have at my home office). Not all teams are co-located or tied to the region. OTOH, my young-adult kids graduated during COVID and have worked mostly remote — office work would benefit from office-based career seasoning. My company has committed to never forcing us back full time, aside from occasional (like monthly) events. We can go in if we want, and I choose to because I really do work better from the office – I get distracted at home with my dog and so on. But anyway, the cat is out of the bag in this situation, and it’s technically the CEO’s call. There are not ZERO benefits to being in the office before people go there, it’s the mandate that’s cruel. Sorry you’re in this. It’s a boulder that’s all the way down the hill. I find this very frustrating as a remote employee. We are all able to WFH as much as we want and come into the office whenever is convenient. In the summer, I am there at least once every two weeks if not more. In the winter with weather and travel, probably more like once a month. However, some of the higher ups and HR are always saying they would love to see more people in the office for no other reason than “Vibes! Collaboration!”. We have employees who live in different time zones and an office in the UK at this point. I work with clients all over the globe and frequently spend most of my day on Teams calls. I am very lucky that I have an entirely separate office at my house (my house was built to contain a dentist office in the 60s) so it truly feels like I am “going to work” when I go there in the morning. In this situation, I think the manager has to be very clear about the mandate and that they will need to enforce it and let people make their decisions. For us the handbook states that WFH could be changed for anyone who lives less than two hours from the office. Are there any parameters to this mandate? Have they set any guidelines? It seems to me the real issue here is that there are no consequences for not coming into the office. My business unit it supposed to be in the office 5 days a week now, but I come in and it’s pretty clear that more than 50% of the people on my floor are not coming in. But you know what? The managers are not allowed to do anything about it. No consequences, no change. The OP’s CEO needs to state what the consequences are and enforce them, otherwise the managers have no power to enforce return to office. The issue isn’t trying to get the CEO to back down on return to office, the issue is to force the CEO to decide how failure to return to the office will be enforced. I’m starting to get a little worn out on the whole return to office debate. CEOs get to dictate what they want. In my case, a condition of my job is to come into the office everyday. I would prefer hybrid, but it’s not really an option. I like my job, I like the money I make, and if it requires being in the office 5 days a week, that’s the deal. (We aren’t unionized, so we lack negotiating power.) My company went hybrid at some point after lockdowns happened (I am not sure on timing as I came in during 2022). Sadly many people abused the hybrid format. If the bosses weren’t in they didn’t come in. Even if you were required to be in. I was hired in during the fall of 2022. And anytime my boss wasn’t in (he travels from office to office) few people were in. My department wasn’t alone in this. It was bad esp in the beginning bc there were days as someone brand new in the role where I was totally alone in the office. Yes I could reach everyone via teams, but honestly it felt a bit unfair I was the only one to abide by the rules. Not gonna lie, I see why lots of placing are enforcing this. If you have brick and mortar place that you “report” to I think the majority of people should prepare themselves to go back in. As much as it stinks. Honestly, it doesn’t sound like the problem is RTO, but rather being overworked and understaffed with poor workplace culture and then RTO on top of that. Going from the details in the letter, RTO is a late-landing straw, not the whole camel-load. In your position, LW, I’d work to rule while job searching. It’s tough out there sadly (LW here). “junior employees who are missing out on the learning by osmosis that happens when they share space with more experienced employees” I keep seeing this offered as a reason for RTO but I think it’s mostly BS. Or at least it’s heavily outweighed by the benefits of WFH for most professional office roles. When I was a “junior employee” long before COVID I don’t remember management caring about anything except me getting my work done and keeping the more senior employees happy. Oh gosh, it’s not at all! I have a new hobby where I go to classes 1-2 days per week. I learn so much from listening to and observing the people who have done it for 25 years even though they are often just talking about ways to improve their excellent work. You could literally never think of all the little things that make a good worker an expert. A hobby where you go to classes not the same as a job. The junior people in my team love being remote and all I got out of being in-office during the first half of my career was dealing with toxicity and being reminded constantly that I was a low-level peon. I can count the senior managers who took an interest in my growth on two fingers. I have opportunity to WFH some and I enjoy those days. I CAN be more productive and generally hold a few tasks that are more focus-intensive for those days. Having said that, the mandate is the mandate. There will likely be consequences when workers decide they want something different than in-office all the time. What I’d hope for as middle management is two things. First I think it would be helpful for the CEO to give a clear “why” for the return to office mandate. Are we more productive? Are we losing out on business because we can’t collaborate as easily? It can’t just be that Amazon is doing it. That doesn’t hold as much water with the workforce as something directly related to YOUR business. Second, he needs to be willing to empower managers to enforce this. If there isn’t a consequence, as there hasn’t been to this point, no one is going to take this seriously. The fact that the present return to office has been so sloppy and willy-nilly isn’t helping this either. CEO can dictate this. CEO also has to realize he may get to find out when he f*cks around. With RTO, I always want to ask is the CEO there full time as well? I guarantee they want butts in seats when they cruise through occasionally but mostly work wherever and whenever they want. This smacks as unfair to employees who have been productive at home. But also I know life isn’t fair and CEO’s always get the lions share. COVID changed expectations about remote work/telework, but before we were all sent home it was understood that telework was a privilege to be earned, not a right. I have argued that this is what we need to return to. If your people are getting their work done from home, and aren’t relying on people who are in to do certain parts of their jobs, they should be eligible to telework. But if your team is like mine, your high performers will still perform at home, the slackers will be slackers no matter where they are, but at least if they are in you can keep an eye on. I never had anyone telework full time, but there were a couple that did three days a week at home because they were very productive there. Again, I think I’d argue to the CEO for telework for those who earn it. Yeah. At my work we have one of those people who claim they can totally work fully remote…but at least once per day they are asking someone to find something for them in the office. They don’t want to admit it…but they need to come in. I work fully remote and it’s a big plus for why I continue to work at my current job, but I also think people have gotten very weird about WFH vs. in office. Yes, not commuting is great! I love the flexibility to work out in the morning and walk my dog, etc. However, on days that I do go into an office, it’s also fine. It’s nice to talk to other people and leave my apartment. It’s nice to have a routine outside of spending 98% of my time in the apartment. And if being 100% remote is your only priority, then you need to have a job that permits that. It doesn’t really matter (IMO) if the job can be done remotely if the CEO is saying they want people in office. Especially when people are flagrantly disregarding the hybrid RTO because they just don’t feel like being in-office! There are arguments above of “okay fine, the CEO gets to make that call and let the chips fall where they may if it’s the bad decision it seems to be”, and that’s LEGALLY true, but let’s put on our human hats here for a second and realize that they pushback is because these are HUMANS we are talking about, their livelihoods are hanging in the balance, and we all know that the workers of a company know how it runs much better than the CEO ever does and we have more than ample examples of examples screaming “STOP! That’s going to sink us all” while the CEO steered the ship right into the iceberg and drowned everyone. My point here is that the livelihoods of many people shouldn’t depend on the bad judgement of one mediocre person at the top who can’t manage effectively. A company that listens to its employees will be successful, not one that blindly follows its CEO. And now I open it up to all the mediocre bosses to comment and tell me how I’m wrong and they are right…. Livelihoods in the balance? Isn’t that rather dramatic? If someone doesn’t like the RTO mandate, they can go find a job elsewhere. That’s their choice. It’s also the CEO’s choice to require everyone in the office 5 days a week. I will say, it is WILD to see how much the opinion on WFH has changed among this site’s commentariat. I was laid off from a job of 13.5 years at the start of the pandemic. After being out of work for 4 months, I got a fully remote job for 8 months (laid off due to expected business increase not happening). I’ve been in office at current job for almost 4 years. Current company owners loathe WFH. Whatever. There are reasons I like being in the office, although I did the same job from home for 8 months during the pandemic. I’m not sure why everyone thinks they’re entitled to WFH after the pandemic ended. Some companies like it and downsized their buildings. But the absolute freaking out and losing it some people display due to RTO mandates? Headscratcher for sure. “we all know that the workers of a company know how it runs much better than the CEO ever does“ Sounds like you’re looking for an anti-work blog, not a career advice blog, Jan. Please rein in the snark. ??? No one is in danger of drowning here. I feel like you’re trying to imply that the LW or the others in the company have a *moral* duty to… do what exactly? Stage a mutiny and wrest control of the company away from the CEO? Over a RTO policy? The policy isn’t illegal, immoral, or dangerous. The absolute worst thing that could happen is that a critical number of employees leave and the company closes/dissolves. Except that’s not particularly likely to happen unless there are other reasons why the company is teetering. The LW referring to some abysmal working conditions might point to this, but if the WFH policy is literally the only thing that’s keeping this company from collapsing… that’s not exactly a good argument for trying to defeat the RTO mandate since that’s basically saying “Don’t rip the band aid off otherwise people might realize they’re hemorrhaging from where I keep stabbing them in their arteries!” What’s *most* likely to happen if the CEO pushes all this through is that a lot of employees will enjoy their jobs less. Some/many? of those will start looking for other jobs and will leave. They’ll be replaced – possibly with less competent/productive people but also possibly with just as competent/productive people who prefer working in an office. I’m curious about the people you say are too comfortable and abusing the system. Have they been spoken to about expectations at all? I work for a company that is largely in-office, but our department is more flexible than most. We had one guy who I think was abusing the system. He would often leave early. When I first started, I was taken aback when he told me that he doesn’t really ever use PTO, even though he goes on vacations and visits family in another state. He said that over the holidays he didn’t take any PTO because he “monitored his emails” while visiting out of town family. So basically the guy glanced at his phone every so often while hanging out with family/going on outings during the workday and put 8 hours of working time. Eventually his boss told him that if he was going out of town, he had to use PTO, and that he was expected to be in the office for 8 hours on his in-office days (remote work wasn’t fully revoked, but it had a lot more restrictions). He eventually left for a fully remote position. I hope he likes his new job better, but this is the type of person who spoils flexible work/hybrid work for the rest of us. This comment just summarized exactly why WFH is going away. As a manager, this is exactly what happens. It simply does. I have changed how I think about this in the past year or so. Previously I was vehemently opposed returning to the office full time, and while I still would prefer hybrid, working in the office full time isn’t a dealbreaker anymore. However, I came to my current employer during lockdown and was remote for the first 18 months. We now work 2-3 days in and the rest from home. If THIS employer tried to tell me to come back in full time, I would quit. There is no way I would ever go into the office full time here. But it wouldn’t be a dealbreaker in a new job, if I knew that was the deal going into it. I wonder how much of this is “I won’t go back to working full time in person” vs. “I won’t work THIS JOB full time in person when I have been doing fine hybrid/remote.” It’s a fair question. Part of the reason I don’t think my job should be fully in office is because I have a team across the US, so I would still be in virtual meetings all day. But the exact same job where everybody comes into the same office would be perfectly fine. I think this is actually a good point. I remember the phrase “a little change hurts a lot, and a lot of change doesn’t hurt that much more.” If I have to radically re-orient myself in my current job, I might as well look around and see if I can do better. They’ve lost the advantage of “devil you know / inertia.” Maybe I won’t find another job that’s fully remote either but I might well discover while I’m looking that I can get more money or a project that seems more exciting that the thing I’ve been working on for the last three years, and now have to keep working on from an office. I think for me it’s a little of both. I don’t want to do this job full time in person because I did it successfully fully remote. But knowing that my job is 100% computer based, I would also be annoyed to have another 100% computer based job in the future that required me to come in. It’s about the nature of the work for me, so I can’t see myself being fine doing hybrid or full-time in office ever again unless the nature of the work demanded that. Just for once during these discussions on RTO, I would love to see proof of the following: 1) everyone going to the office and just sitting on Zoom, not talking to any of their team members 2) CEOs continuing to work from their beach houses instead of in the office 3) CEOs not using any sort of reasoning for demanding return to office (because they’re all just doing it off of vibes, I guess?) A lot of AAM commenters just throw these things out but I’d love to know widespread these phenomena are. Or is everyone taking the same dozen examples and insisting that every RTO policy is like that? #3 certainly happens – the reason will be a vague “collaboration” or talk about the energy of the office and all the great brainstorming that will occur. The Amazon RTO was not based on data at all, just on “vibes” and “gut feelings”. There have been articles written about it. Google is your friend. Despite your Mr. Burns stereotype, CEOs are generally not making arbitrary decisions based on no data whatsoever. As to “it happens,” well, it’s a big universe, and undoubtedly you can find exceptions. But the plural of “anecdote” isn’t “data”; they’re certainly not doing at *as a class*, at scale. #1 was the case in my company and I had to push for in-person meetings. If we’re going to be in the office, it doesn’t make sense to be Zooming, and if we’re worried about making each other sick, we shouldn’t be in the office. What kind of proof can we offer? We can’t share internal communications or photos of our offices. We can only share anecdotes about what we’ve experienced. #1 is me twice a week. Any meetings are virtual & my most substantive (live) interaction with a team member is at the end of the day when our admin says goodbye to me on their way out. As the LW here, I can tell you #1 super happens for our situation. My team is quite friendly, but they’re often stuck in meetings. Our CEO comes in 50% of the time himself, and sits on his phone in his office. If he’s not busy on his phone, he’s giving random projects that impede the paying client work. I’m the office admin/receptionist at a company that’s just done this and I’m of two minds. On one hand, I was constantly being made to pick up the slack for people abusing the hybrid system. People would flake out of coming into the office and opt to work from home at the last minute and then I’d be stuck redirecting all of their mail/onboarding their new hires/supervising complicated technical installations by third party contractors in their area of the building. On the other hand, we downsized to a smaller office during the pandemic and the new space can’t comfortably accommodate everyone at one time. The mandatory return to three days a week (with basically everyone choosing to come in Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday) has been a logistical nightmare for me. Everyone’s already cranky about having to come in and I’m the closest punching bag. I literally feel sick about going into the office every morning and I don’t even get the benefit of two WFH days. Sorry, hit “Submit” too quickly. My point is that I think the issue with a lot of return-to-office policies is that they’re not made in consultation with the people most affected (i.e. low-level pink collar office grunts like me) and therefore are often done in a way that causes maximum inconvenience to everyone involved. This sucks and I’m sorry. I hope you’re given a chance to express everything you’ve experienced/observed to someone who can help make a change. This. You have grounds to push back on this, and if you’re coming to work feeling sick every day because of it, I think it’s probably a good idea that you do because you can’t continue like this. Do we work for the same company because this sounds startlingly similar. I’m sorry you’re in the same boat as me :( I work for a very large and bureaucratic organization (multiple business units & subsidiaries, dozens of folks that could be called “upper management”) that mandated a 3 day in the office week back when RTO was just a vague concept. My office/subsidiary resisted a long time, our CEO is very pro remote work, plus our work teams are split among 4 time zones so everything is happening on Teams no matter where your desk sits. Higher management began enforcing RTO across all offices in early 2023, so while we don’t like it, we’ve had to learn how to live with it and work around it. I have mandated that my team’s in office days are Tues-Thurs with the agreement that anyone can swap days if they need to, as long as I’m informed. I also know things may change for special circumstances. The overall company only tracks swipes in to the building. I figure, as long as our group average for days swiped in stays around 3 days per week, we should remain under the radar. This also means I can split days (half day in the office, half day at home) without anyone raising concerns. If there are big meetings or events in the office, I notify everyone I advance and strongly encourage attendance that day. Sometimes it sucks to be the bad guy when I don’t want to be there either, but if we can work within the rules and fly under the radar, while also getting our work done, then I think I’m meeting everyone’s expectations. at my job, the people who moved away from our city during the pandemic are allowed to stay remote but everyone who still lives here has to go in three times a week. if you don’t, you might get reprimanded by your manager, who works fully remote and you have never met in person. all of it is clearly just to justify their expensive office. make it make sense. Same at my employer. The division I am in has been more flexible and looks the other way (for now), but the inconsistencies are unfair to those stuck going in while their colleagues who moved get to remain remote and connect with those in-office via Teams. I’m one of the lucky ones who moved away. Honestly, if WFH were as great for the company and productivity as online communities claim it would be the new normal. Personal observation – only 10 to 15% of the workforce is professional and self-motivated enough to WFH, the rest just aren’t. And that’s okay. Given this particular situation, where the employees blew off a good compromise and are now looking at 5 days a week, my guess is that is will be years until they try WFH again, and are prepared to lose workers over it. Preach! Interesting, I’d say only 10-15% of professional class workers AREN’T cut out for remote work in my experience. Most of us have stakeholders, partners, coworkers, etc. who live in other places so we’re already “remote” even when we’re in the office. And all it takes to “try” remote work again is a manager or two deciding that they’re going to allow it or upper management deciding that it’s not worth enforcing anymore. Or recruitment/retention problems. But it IS the new normal for many jobs and workplaces. This trend started many years before Covid, the pandemic only accelerated it and made some work places that were unprepared or for whom it was unsuitable try do do it because there was no choice except shutting down altogether. Perhaps point out that staff won’t be working back to 11pm and putting in the extra. Who’s going to be able to work until 11pm say arrive home at 12.30am to be up and leaving by 7.30am to commute back in AND be productive! Discussions about to WFH or to not WFH are like discussions around American politics right now. Neither side is willing to even admit a tiny little bit that the other side might have good points, and both sides think the other side is idiotic/uneducated/too old/dangerous. I’m honestly tired of hearing about any of it, and I don’t understand how after five years of this we still have so much to say about it. It’s not like there’s been any massive revelations or breakthroughs. Anyway, OP, your CEO gets to make whatever rules he wants to, it’s why he’s the CEO. You would need to organize a big enough group with enough capital and craft a cohesive proposition as to how WFH would benefit him and the company to push back on his mandates, and even then you’ve got a 50/50 chance. If you can pull it off, great. If not though, you’ve got to first decide if this is a place you want to stay at. If that answer is still yes, then you have to hold your people accountable to the rules of the establishment whether you empathize with them or not. This is a great analogy “Neither side is willing to even admit a tiny little bit that the other side might have good points, and both sides think the other side is idiotic/uneducated/too old/dangerous.” This … is an unfortunate summary of the whole debate. Doesn’t fix anything, but here we are. I don’t think anyone on the “WFH side” refuses to acknowledge that there can be benefits to in person work. I think it’s the mandatory and pointless nature that people have a problem with. I work remotely 5 days a week but am forced to do so at an office 3 days a week for some reason. If I needed to be in person occasionally for good reason I’d be fine with that. I think most of us would be. Whereas the “RTO side” seems to base their entire position on maybe one potentially legit reason (collaboration) and the rest is just vibes and “well some people can’t WFH at all due to their nature of their job and you did it before so suck it up!” Even “collaboration” is vibes like 90% of the time it’s used. I think part of the issue here is that both sides are assuming what the other side thinks WFH/Remote work is a disability justice issue. Work already leans far far far towards arbitrary and nonsensical business “needs” at the expense of employee quality of life. We don’t need to encourage it by letting these RTO mandates be implemented without challenging them, or pretending that people who are advocating for the right for WFH are somehow entitled, elitist, lazy, antisocial, etc. I am multiply-disabled. If I had to work in an office, I wouldn’t be able to work. Because I get to work from home, I’m able to support myself, my husband and my son on my income alone. Commuting, not being in control of my work environment, spending energy on social interactions in office, are just some of the things that make working in the office impossible for me to maintain long term. Who is stopping people who want to work in the office from working in the office? No one. But plenty of companies are using RTO mandates to get rid of staff, to enforce archaic standards, to encourage unhealthy and unproductive management styles, etc. etc. etc. Nothing good for the working class comes from these mandates. I think that part of the issue is that WFH people are used to people demeaning our work and treating it as though it isn’t “real” work. The “essential” terminology during the pandemic exacerbated that (my answering a crisis hotline from home and helping homeless DV survivors apply for benefits/obtain housing and food/etc from home was not “essential to remain in person” but I would argue that it was pretty essential in that it’s work that needed to be done, and there was in fact heightened need for it during the pandemic). I’m used to having to defend my work as work, the dignity of my labor. I try to not dig in with blanket statements in the way you’re describing. Not all work is the same. Everyone should have good (safe, well-paid) working conditions, but that will mean different things in different jobs. But I do feel the need to assert the value of my own work in no uncertain terms, because it’s pretty common for anti-WFH people to demean it. Yeah, just like the people who call remote workers “entitled” because we chose careers that don’t require in-person hands on. Annoying. After 2020 – 2021 being WFH (with some, like me, going in about 1x a week to do things) our office went back with a mandated 3-2 hybrid schedule (3 in office) in January 2022 (with a three-month advance warning). There are very formal and strict rules around it which can seem unfair or antiquated on the individual level but work across the institution to make things fair. Our division has a rule that everyone is in the office on Mondays which is the day for internal meetings and this works really well for us. As someone in my industry for more than 20 years, this seems to be a good balance between work/life and the subtle benefits of in-office work, especially for new and new-to-the-industry employees. It’s not perfect, but as a manager I appreciate that the rules are strict – I can pretty easily point to them if anyone abuses the schedule. This is less about what’s “right” or “wrong” or how things “should” be but more about what IS. Then everyone can decide if they want to remain on the job or leave. Because you fill the role you do, you are committed to doing what is best for the company since the company is who pays you. I say all this as a junior employee myself who only WFH one day a week and sits in traffic twice a day. Since everyone on your team is an adult, they need to make adult, treat them as such. I feel like so much of the insistence on returning to office can be attributed to companies wanting to “get their money’s worth” on commercial leases. We had an office that, prior to COVID, most staff worked at home at least part-time, with many others only coming in for meetings. After COVID, no one returned to the office. When our execs realized that staff did not have a desire to return, and productivity had not changed, they quickly found another company to sublet our office space. It was around that time that I saw some numbers for how much we had been paying for the office. I was blown away! We were able to take the funds that had previously gone towards the lease and contribute them to some much desired employee benefits. When the lease ended, we did not renew, and there’s not been a single complaint to the best of my knowledge. Exactly. Commercial Real Estate is expensive. Until you can get that off your balance sheet, companies will insist on Return to Office. It doesn’t matter at all what employees want to do, or even if it’s better to work from home. Rule #1 of microeconomics: Ignore sunk costs. Nothing about whether employees are in the office or not changes the fact that the lease has already been signed and the future cash flow is obligated to it. Lease? How about if the company *owns* the building. That’s the instance with the office where I am. I think the outside of business hour calls are a distraction. If this business existed in the before times they surely navigated phone calls then. Is it nice to have more options? Perhaps (although for whom??? because separation of work and life is a good thing). I totally agree with Allison and the commenters about there needing to be consequences or not. Having an unenforced policy is the same as not having a policy. he certainly wouldn’t be the first CEO to cling to an old way of operating because that’s what he’s comfortable with, without recognizing that the workforce has changed, or that what technology makes possible has changed, or that what top talent in your field will demand has changed. Honestly, these folks, even the younger ones, need to retire. It’s not about age — it’s the inflexibility. I get that commercial rents can be steep, especially in larger cities, but if that’s the main problem, there has to be a solution. Move the office maybe — I don’t know. What I do know is that workers with in-demand skills will bail over stuff like this. I remember in early 2020 and even into 2021, there were so many articles about how there was going to be a reckoning in the workplace and things were going to permanently change, and I just had to side-eye it a bit because my experience was that senior leadership was mostly stuck in their ways and seemingly incapable of adapting to a new reality at the best of times. Everyone thought work-from-home was here to stay, but these leaders were just counting down the days that everything could go back to 2019, not finding a way to manage their workforce differently. Which is fine, that’s their prerogative and they can do whatever they want with their workforce, but I think anyone making that choice surrenders the right to ever be called innovative or forward-thinking as a leader ever again. I think what those back-to-2019 leaders don’t understand is that the burden of proof has shifted. Pre-COVID a leader resistant to WFH could always demand “more proof” that the employee would be just as productive, connected, etc. Well, 202o provided that proof and more. Senior leaders who don’t realize that and think that motivational poster slogans and declarations that “it’s time” and “COVID’s over” are going to be convincing or motivating are going to be disappointed, in the long run. There may not be an immediate exit, but there will be damage. Of course they can demand that their employees return to the office, but if they do not want to damage their credibility they will need to provide some actual justifications for why the employees need to come back. My first question is: Do you have flexible work hours? If not, bringing that in or codifying it (core hours, min hours per day max hours per day) could help maintain some of the value of WfH flexibility. Honestly, I’d try to get a different job. You’re tired, demoralised, unappreciated – leave. When you get a new role, encourage all your staff to brush up their resumes and interviewing skills to leave, too. Sometimes what is needed is “how about Go F Yourself?” for a person in the CEO’s position to understand that them *wanting* something doesn’t make it *important* or *valuable* to the business. In some cases that means they learn, in others they get replaced, in others they get outvoted on policies, and in others the business tanks because they have a shitty reputation and big staff loss. Truth hurts. My situation is complex. I do often think to myself that my junior staff would be better off elsewhere. I’m waiting for them to figure it out. The RTO mandate will make them think of that more quickly for sure. “I’ve never worked as hard as I’ve had to this past year, due to layoffs and terrible clients. It’s so demoralizing working until 11 pm sometimes and still be expected to be cheery the next morning in-office for the benefit of an out-of-touch CEO.” Sounds like your best bet for how to deal with this problem is to GTFO and let it be someone else’s problem. This is exactly what’s happening at my midsize government office. Three days butts in seats no questions or excuses. And the GM has forced all non union represented staff back in full time. I have a hybrid role often working in the field, have a company vehicle, etc. I am equipped as a field staff. I also am one of the folks who absolutely benefits from and is more productive doing remote work, and I am a leader in my department and highly productive, so it rots my socks that someone six managers above me who doesn’t even know what I do for the organization let alone my name should be able to dictate where I do my job. Meanwhile, all our team meetings are still on zoom because we have three conference rooms for 600 people, and they’re cutting our cubicles in half because they’re running out of space to put people. And yes, should the 5 day mandate come down, I will absolutely leave over this. They’ll lose an experienced project manager and changemaker with 22 years of experience. Until then, Allison is absolutely hitting the nail on the head – what is the consequence of ignoring in office mandates? I suspect I’ll be one of the first to find out. They can try me. At this point, it’s been a generation since remote work started, and 5 years since covid. Everyone has an opinion on WFH, it’s mainly based on their own personal experience, and it’s not changing. Counter evidence can be dismissed as unreliable, beside the point, or a price worth paying for the greater good. So let’s all move on. Literally, if the policy doesn’t fit the life you want. I actually think the truest and most important thing you said is this: “I don’t want to care about this.” Stop caring about it. It’s not your decision to make, and you’ve done what you can. Let it go. Tell your employees that the CEO has decided XYZ and HR or whoever has instructed that people who don’t follow the rule will be put on a PIP/fired. You know how the kids are into quiet quitting? Take a leaf from their book. Do your job, don’t stress about it. Easier said than done. And maybe start looking for a job? I’m sure you’ve considered it; this place sounds like it’s stressing you out in more ways than one. In the legal and security areas, there’s a view on how employees engage with regulation. Its very similar to how people view change. At the far-right, you have the champions. And yes, we want people to champion change because we like people to be active and accountable and all that. They see the value and care for it, and in championing they try to make other people see the value. But the middle of the diagram, the point that people need to meet for the change to happen, is not “acceptance”, is is “compliance”. It is okay for people to not want a change. It is okay for them to believe it is silly. It is okay for them to believe its not valuable. They just to have to it regardless. You aren’t actually here to change their minds. You do not need to care. You do not need to champion to make other people care. You just need to go back to the line of “we are required to work from the office. I am going to measure your compliance, and if you do not comply I will act accordingly. How you feel doesn’t change what we’re required to do.” Unpopular Opinion: people making no effort to comply to the RTO order should be put on a PIP and then fired if they don’t comply. Because THEY are ruining it for everyone. So many people are doing their best to keep the flexibility and a few selfish jerks shouldn’t be able to ruin it for everyone. Also as someone who has run the gamut between in-office hybrid and fully remote AND was unemployed for 9 months last year i will continue to scream till im blue in the face that this job market is horrible, the hiring process has been absolutely destroyed by AI and the only way you can get an interview is if you know someone… maybe. Please don’t lose your job over being stubborn about RTO. Now is not the time. I don’t know if it needs to be as strong as a PIP, but this manager seems to have decided that, having opted to allow her staff to do 2 days instead of 3 in office (And thus already bending the rules), she can’t do anything about people who bend the limit she DID set, and never show up, or can’t be reached. And she absolutely can! She’s a manager! This is an extremely timely question, on Tuesday we got an email that we NEED to be in the office for at least 3 days a week up from our 1 that we could skip with a reason. From what my division manager has said is that he will not be enforcing it for our division since we have proven time & time again that we can work remotely successfully. However for the next few weeks it would be best to be in the office more often. We work well doing 1 day a week in the office and coming in to the facilities as needed when our projects are being worked on the shop floors. The 3 days would be up to us to choose what days we want to come in and which of 2 facility we want to work out of. The biggest issue is that up until early Fall we were in the upstairs of our 1st, original, facility and were moved to a new smaller area in the 2nd facility (~1 mile away). Our projects are located between both facilities but more are being moved to the 2nd facility from what we have been told. When we were upstairs at the 1st facility, the division manager and lower project managers all had nice offices and the rest of us engineers had nice sized large desks. The new 2nd facility area has ‘breakout rooms’ which the managers claimed since it was the closest to an office, but they lack desks (have tables instead) and don’t have multiple monitor setups, only a large TV on the wall. We got much smaller desks that were meant to be hot swappable with no separations between them and no storage for our samples, test equipment, and catalogs we need to reference when doing our jobs, it feels like we are now in a call center instead of an engineering facility. We also have to travel with our projects, so there have been times (before 2020) that I was not in the office for weeks at a time due to working off-site when everyone else was in the office full time. The big boss (the one who demanded the change to a minimum of 3 days) still has his extremely large office in the 1st faculty, and I have only seen him at the 2nd location twice in the past 3 years since we had it. There is a large discontentment in our division right now but our direct managers don’t want to do this either, so it is nice for them to have our backs. I just wanted to suggest commenters think about how all this would read to someone lower-income who has to go into their workplace daily and WFH is *never* an option, such as grocery store workers, etc., those who were so essential during the pandemic. I usually don’t say “check your privilege,” but I think that certain applies in this thread. Not. Relevant. They chose their career/job. Those that work remote chose theirs. How many currently remote workers chose remote? I’d bet a lot of them just fell into it due to the pandemic and their employers not returning to the office. Doesn’t matter. It’s a role that can be remote. You’re arguing that the conversation should be flavored because of those that can’t. That’s what’s not relevant. Many of us who are advocating to keep the ability to work from home are disabled and/or immunocompromised. Your take is ridiculous. your comment doesn’t make sense. then again most of the people who never WFH during the height of the pandemic just don’t get it and it’s fine. this conversation is clearly for the office workers who shifted from in-person only to either fully remote or light hybrid, made life and family choices based on those mandates and now seeing back paddling from their higher ups Comments are closed. show me a random post Collapse/Expand all threaded comments Ask a Manager ^ Back to top Copyright © 2007 - 2025 Ask A Manager.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s $3 trillion run-up in market value in the two years since ChatGPT helped trigger an AI frenzy is bigger than any stock rally in history in such a short time span. But the landscape is now changing for the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that. Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam. “I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.” That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday. Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory. “Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.” Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago. That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year: AI Spending Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI. “At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares. Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology. So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth. “It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said. Competition Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024. Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia. However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore. “Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December. And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023. Valuation How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up. For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.” Top Tech Stories The US plans to unveil more regulations aimed at keeping advanced chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other producers from flowing to China, part of a flurry of measures introduced by the Biden administration during its final days in office. Elon Musk cheated Twitter shareholders out of more than $150 million by waiting too long to disclose his growing stake in the company as he prepared a takeover bid, the US Securities and Exchange Commission claimed in a lawsuit filed days before the Trump administration takes over. SpaceX launched a pair of commercial satellites carrying lunar rovers as competition intensifies in the private sector’s race to the moon. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai is joining Silicon Valley executives bidding for a London-based cricket team, according to people familiar with the matter. Synthesia, an artificial intelligence startup that lets businesses produce lifelike video avatars, has raised $180 million in a funding round making it one of Britain’s largest AI companies. Intel Corp., the once-dominant chipmaker struggling to revive its business and finances, plans to turn its venture capital arm into a separate fund with a new name.

Estimates for California's devastating fires continue to grow with some estimates reaching as high ... [+] as $180 billion. (Photo by David Swanson / AFP) (Photo by DAVID SWANSON/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks were mixed on Tuesday with the S&P 500 up just 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. Both the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 1% and 0.5%, respectively. The muted moves came following the release of the Producer Price Index, which showed slower than expected increases in prices. Tuesday's Core PPI was forecast to show an increase of 0.4% on a month-to-month basis, but the actual increase was just 0.2%. That number offered a preview of today's Consumer Price Index, which was expected to show core prices increased month-over-month by 0.3% and a yearly increase of 3.3%, according to Bloomberg. The actual numbers were slightly below those expectations. Month-over-month was up 0.2% while year-over-year, prices were higher by 3.2%. Turning to earnings, major banks are kicking things off this morning. So far, we've heard from JP Morgan who beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending that stock higher by 2% in premarket. Wells Fargo also beat on earnings. One standout metric was their investment banking fees which grew by 59%. Wells in not typically the first name that comes to mind when discussing investment banking, so this may be an area of growth to keep an eye on. But net interest income is the standout metric here for both banks. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo forecast strong growth for net interest income in 2025. Goldman Sachs also released their earnings in premarket. The company crushed expectations across the board. Goldman said it expected investment banking and trading fees to grow double digits in 2025. Lastly, Citigroup is out with earnings, issuing beats on the top and bottom lines. All four banking stocks are trading higher in premarket activity. A few other stocks in the news include Meta, Alphabet and Eli Lilly. Meta announced it will more aggressively manage out underperforming workers and as a result the company will cut 5% of its workforce in the U.S. As the job market is cooling, we're seeing the power pendulum swing back towards companies. This comes after a red-hot labor market was giving job seekers a significant advantage following Covid. Alphabet is being investigated by U.K antitrust regulators over how Google search results may affect competition. Lastly, Eli Lilly cut its fourth-quarter forecast citing weaker than expected growth for the company's insulin and weight loss drugs. However, the company did say they expect strong growth for their weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in 2025. Turning to the chip sector, the Biden administration announced it plans more regulations for advanced chips being produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and others from being exported to China. Another stock in the AI chip sector that's making news is Nvidia. Shares of that stock have fallen for the past five trading days and are down 12% from their highs, putting the stock in a correction. This is particularly noteworthy because Nvidia has been at the forefront of the stock market rally over the past couple years. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if this is simply some short-term profit taking, the beginning of a longer-term downturn for the overall market, or a changing of the guard and opportunity for another sector to lead the market. A few more odds and ends. After hitting a low of just over $89,000 on Monday, bitcoin is trading higher and looks set to make another run at $100,000. Oil prices remain within striking distance of $80 per barrel. As I've previously mentioned, so long as oil remains below $80, its impact on the economy is relatively muted. However, a break above $80 may prompt fears of a return of inflation. Finally, Forbes is saying the cost from the California fires may reach as high as $150 billion. This is simply a tragic story and one that, unfortunately, continues to unfold. For today, the story is a combination of earnings and muted inflation. The outlook for the banking sector, especially net interest income, is being buoyed by forecasts for fewer interest rates cuts by the Fed. Elevated rates mean more interest income. The outlook for rates should come as no surprise to regular readers of my column as I've been discussing it ad nauseam. Combine that with a weaker than expected CPI and you get stocks up nearly 2% in premarket trading. I would caution readers that this is just the very beginning of earnings season and there is a long way to go still. However, the start is looking pretty good and may be exactly what this market needs. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Accurate energy demand forecasting is critical for efficient energy management and planning. Recent advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets have fueled the development of machine learning models. However, selecting the most appropriate features to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness remains a key challenge. This study proposes an ensemble approach that integrates a genetic algorithm with multiple forecasting models to optimize feature selection. The genetic algorithm identifies the optimal subset of features from a dataset that includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal characteristics. These selected features are then used to train three base learners: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The predictions from these models are combined using a stacking ensemble technique to generate the final forecast. To enhance model evaluation, we divided the dataset into weekday and weekend subsets, allowing for a more detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted ten simulations and applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to the results. The proposed model demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 130.6, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.38%, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 99.41 for weekday data. The model also maintained high accuracy for weekend predictions, with an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This research provides valuable insights for energy analysts and contributes to developing more sophisticated demand forecasting methods.

In the modern era, accurate energy demand forecasting has become an essential component of efficient energy management. Energy consumption is rising for various reasons, such as population growth, increasing building energy needs, and expanding technological applications. According to the data presented in [1], global energy consumption is expected to rise by approximately 70% by the year 2040. This alarming figure has necessitated the development of advanced predictive models to forecast energy demand, which are crucial for optimizing energy use in smart cities, thereby making them more efficient and sustainable. Machine learning models have become increasingly popular due to advancements in computational techniques and the availability of large amounts of data [2]. However, a critical challenge in these models is the effective selection of relevant features that enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address this issue, we have implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal feature selection. The study first trains the model to determine the best features from the dataset with the help of GA; afterward, these features are fed into a stacking-based ensemble model for further training and evaluation. At its core, energy demand forecasting may be broken down into two distinct ways: traditional methods and more modern machine learning-based techniques [3, 4]. Conventional methods include statistical analysis, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (EA), and regression-based approaches [5]. These methods have proven effective for linear problems. On the other hand, machine learning methods are adept at handling non-linear scenarios. Notable among these are Random Forest (RF) [6], Decision Tree (DT) [7], and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [8], which have been utilized for energy demand forecasting, as discussed in recent studies. However, it is important to note that while machine learning models offer substantial advantages in time series prediction, they are also susceptible to limitations, such as the potential for becoming trapped in local minima, particularly if hyperparameters are not optimally tuned. Several diverse methods have been developed for forecasting future energy consumption, from the very short term (minutes) to the very long term (years) (weeks) [9, 10]. Accurately predicting energy demand is crucial; an overestimation can lead to unnecessary conversion of excess energy, which is costly in terms of time, money, and resources, while underestimation may result in blackouts from supply line overloads. Typically, forecasting is divided into three categories based on the prediction horizon: short-term load forecasting (from an hour to a week), medium-term load forecasting (from a month to a year), and long-term load forecasting (beyond a year) [11]. Prediction of short-term loads is a major challenge. Indeed, schedules may be created to determine the distribution of generating resources, operational limits, environmental restrictions, and equipment usage restrictions with the help of accurate and dependable predictions [12]. In addition, the power systems may be optimized more using these predictions for the expected load condition in the future. Key contributions of this paper are as follows: The evolution of the paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, the related work of the study has been explained in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the methodology used in this study. The experimental setup for the training of our model is then described in Section 4. Our proposed framework is presented in Section 5. The obtained results are carefully examined and discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents a summary of the key findings, discusses their implications, and suggests directions for further investigation. Electricity distribution networks are foundational to long-term prosperity and societal advancement. Power consumption forecasts must always be accurate and efficient when developing energy predictions for the dynamic electricity sector. In the dynamic electricity sector, power consumption forecasts must be both precise and efficient. Over recent decades, a myriad of methods for predicting future energy demand has emerged [13, 14]. Typically, these methods employ time series datasets of past energy usage to construct forecasting models [15]. The majority of the approaches presented for predicting a building’s energy usage may be broken down into two classes: statistical and artificial intelligence-based. For forecasting and analyzing energy use in the future, statistical approaches use the available historical data to build probabilistic models. ARIMA, ARMA, and ARIMAX are well-known statistical methods that have been used to predict future energy consumption. However, AI-driven approaches can improve forecasting accuracy due to their ability to identify non-linear trends in time series data [16]. Despite the widespread use of feature selection techniques like correlation-based, filter, and wrapper methods in research, there remains a significant opportunity to incorporate more sophisticated techniques to refine these predictions further. LSTM networks have demonstrated promising results in time series analysis [17]. Older variants of RNNs, such as Recurrent Backpropagation, require a very long time to learn and store the information over an extended period. To address these challenges, Hochreiter et al. [18] developed a gradient-based method called LSTM neural network [19], which is the extended version of a recurrent neural network. LSTM networks have both long-term memory and short-term memory, and it reduces the problem of exploding and vanishing gradient. Numerous researchers have leveraged the LSTM network to forecast energy demand. Bouktif et al. [20] integrated various machine learning models along with LSTM to develop a model for short-term load demand of energy. In another study, the authors [21] presented a statistical model, SARIMA, to predict hourly wind speed in the coastal area of Scotland. They utilized three-time series datasets collected from different elevations. The accuracy of the forecasting model can be enhanced by using a combination of the homogeneous or heterogeneous models. Li et al. [22] considered this benefit and proposed a multi-energy forecasting method for energy systems using a fusion of a Convolutional Neural Network and GRU (CNN-GRU) with transfer learning on a parallel architecture. The performance of the model was further refined through hyperparameter tuning, leading to more accurate results. A summary of notable studies on demand forecasting is provided in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t001 Significant progress has been made in enhancing energy demand forecasting using deep learning models. However, a gap remains in optimizing feature selection within these models. To address this gap, we propose a two-tiered approach. The first step involves applying a genetic algorithm to identify and select the most influential features. In the subsequent step, we employ a stacking ensemble method that combines the strengths of multiple predictive models. This synergistic approach not only refines the feature set but also integrates various models to substantially improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts. Numerous studies have explored data-driven techniques due to their ability to predict loads and energy consumption across various scenarios [33]. The standard data-driven approach typically minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances to determine the optimal parameters [34]. A widely used method is linear regression [35], which identifies the best-fitting straight line across the training data. In addition to the linear model, ridge regression penalizes the extreme values of the weighted matrix to deal with multi-collinearity [36]. There has been a noticeable improvement in the development and interpretation of these linear regression models. An example of a non-parametric model is the K-nearest neighbor, in which the forecast is just the mean of all the neighbors [37]. With the optimal parameter settings, this method provides accurate outcomes for electrical load forecasting; it is also relatively easy to understand and implement in practice. Rather than relying on a single decision tree, which can lead to overfitting, ensemble models employ a network of decision trees to make predictions, such as additional trees and random forests. Gradient boosting further enhances tree accuracy by employing an ensemble of weak learners that assign greater weight to misclassified predictions [38]. The objective of this study is to develop an advanced method for predicting energy consumption. This is accomplished by integrating deep learning models using a stacking ensemble approach with a feature selection process optimized through a genetic algorithm (GA). With GA, our goal is to find the optimal Chromosome C*, that maximizes Fitness (C) as given in Eq (1) (1) Where C = [c1, c2, ……, cn] is the chromosome, and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. With stacking, our goal is to minimize the loss function using the feature subset X' chosen by the GA and forecasts generated by the stacking model given in Eq (2) (2) Here Mj(X') represents the prediction output of the j-th model, and S is the stacking layer function that aggregates the prediction from the individual models. In summary, the GA enhances the quality of the model input by optimizing the feature space, whereas the stacked model utilizes the advantages of numerous deep learning architectures to provide reliable prediction outputs. In this subsection, we outline the key challenges in energy demand forecasting and explain how our proposed method effectively addresses each challenge. The high-dimensional nature of datasets in energy demand forecasting presents a significant challenge in selecting the most relevant features [39]. This task is computationally intensive and often includes redundant or irrelevant features, which can degrade model performance. This study employs a GA to search for the optimal subset of features systematically. The GA uses a fitness function based on the inverse of Mean Squared Error to evaluate predictive accuracy given in Eq (3) (3) Where C is a chromosome representing a subset of features. A crucial challenge in energy demand forecasting is preventing overfitting by ensuring the model works effectively with unknown data. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on new data [40]. By using the GA to determine the most informative features, our approach improves the model’s generalizability. The high-dimensional feature spaces might result in longer training times and more resource use due to the computational complexity. This challenge is significant in practical applications where computing efficiency is the highest priority. Our genetic algorithm-based approach addresses this difficulty by decreasing the number of features. The GA progressively improves the feature subset, reducing input space that retains the most significant features. Let n be the original number of features and k the number of selected features after GA optimization, where k < n. In this section, we provide a concise overview of the methodologies employed in this study. This section presents an introduction to the basics of time series analysis. To get a more thorough analysis of time series analysis, we suggest reading [41, 42]. Time Series (TS) analysis is a valuable tool for studying energy demand patterns, which inherently vary over time due to their time-dependent nature. It involves applying statistical or artificial intelligence methods to predict future trends by analyzing previously collected information. A time series composed of P real-valued data points a1, …., aP each ai (where 1 ≤ i ≤ P) signifies the value recorded at the time i. The task of time series forecasting can be described as predicting future values az+1, …. az+k based on the preceding a1, …, az values (where z + k ≤ P). The goal here is to reduce the difference between the forecasted value and the actual value az+j (for 1 ≤ j ≤ k). In this context, ‘z’ represents the historical window, indicating the number of past data points considered for making predictions, and ‘k’ denotes the prediction horizon, which is the extent of the future we aim to predict. Time series analysis has been applied in a wide range of real-life applications such as Anomaly detection [43], financial indices [44], Healthcare [45], Weather prediction, and energy consumption [46]. In contrast to traditional approaches, which focus on parametric-based models, namely auto-regressive, Moving Average, and structural TS [47], the Artificial intelligence-based model offers purely data-driven approaches. GA are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics [48]. With this technique, our goal is to identify the subset of features that contributes the most to the predictive power of a given model. In this study, we employed the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library, which provides a flexible and customizable framework for creating genetic algorithms. Below is a detailed description of the GA process for feature selection. Let C = [c1, c2, ……, cn ] be a chromosome, where n is the number of features and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. The fitness of an individual is evaluated based on the performance of the model using the selected subset of features. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the fitness metric presented in Eq (4). The goal is to find the optimal chromosome C* that maximizes Fitness (C) Formally: The steps employed for determining the best features are shown in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g001 The GA identifies the best subset of features from the dataset, which includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal features, by exploring various combinations to maximize predictive accuracy. The GA reduces redundancy and noise by choosing only the most relevant features, resulting in more accurate and robust model training. This optimized feature set enhances the model’s performance, allowing it to generalize better from training data to unseen data, as shown by improved Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Furthermore, reducing the number of features decreases computational complexity, leading to faster training times without sacrificing accuracy. Ensemble models have gained popularity in recent years mainly because of the great outcomes they produce on various tasks, such as classification and regression issues [49]. These techniques include the combination of multiple models of learning to enhance the performance of each model individually. Ensemble learning was first explored in the 1990s when it proved that many weak learners could be turned into strong learners. Typically, two stages are involved in this process. Initially, a variety of base learners are developed from the training data. Subsequently, these learners are combined in the second stage to create a cohesive prediction model. This results in multiple forecasts derived from individual base learners being merged into a more effective composite model, which typically outperforms each of the base models. Consolidating several effective individual models into a single enhanced model usually results in greater predictive accuracy. Bagging, boosting, and stacking are the three most popular and well-known fundamental ensemble approaches [50]. In bagging, multiple models are created, with each model’s results given equal weight, and a voting method determines the most common outcome. For regression, the mean of predictions is typically used. Boosting, similar to bagging, differs by assigning varying weights to models, with the final result being a weighted vote. In regression contexts, this means a weighted average. On the other hand, Stacking employs different algorithms for model building, followed by a combiner algorithm that uses these models’ outputs to make final predictions. Any ensemble approach can be used as the combiner in stacking. Ensemble learning techniques have been applied in various time series forecasting methods, including energy demand. Zhang et al. [51] introduced an extreme learning machine (ELM) method utilized in the electricity market. Tan et al. [52] combined wavelet transform with ARIMA and GARCH models for price forecasting in Spanish and PJM electricity markets. In another study, authors [49] developed an ensemble model using Bayesian Clustering by Dynamics (BCD) and SVM, which was tested on New York City’s historical load data. Later, Tasnim et al. [21] created an ensemble framework based on the cluster for predicting wind power, employing regression models on wind data from various Australian locations. LSTM is a specific form of RNN structure developed to tackle the challenge of the vanishing gradient problem and efficiently capture the patterns in sequential data [53]. This is achieved by utilizing a specialized gating mechanism that effectively controls the transmission of information within the network. A standard LSTM unit has three primary gates, as shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g002 where w and b are weights and biases and ⏀ represent activation function, which is sigmoid in our study. Uf is a weight matrix associated with the forget gate. Unlike standard LSTM, BiLSTM is able to learn from both the past and future as processes input in both directions. This feature enhances its capability to model sequential dependencies in language processing tasks. BiLSTM involves adding an additional LSTM layer that processes the input sequence in reverse. The outputs of both forward and backward layers are then merged using techniques like averaging, summing, multiplying, or concatenating. The unrolled BiLSTM structure is presented in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g003 The forward and backward propagation output of the above diagram has been shown below: Eqs (11), (12), and (13). Where x, h, and c are the input state, hidden state, and temporary state. The GRU model demonstrates superior computational efficiency by employing a lower number of training parameters. As a result, memory utilization and training times are reduced. The simpler architecture, consisting of two gates, Eqs (14) and (15), reduces the possibility of overfitting on smaller datasets. Moreover, the GRU shows improved stability during the training process, requiring reduced fine-tuning for hyperparameters. Fig 4 shows a simple GRU network. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g004 Update Gate (Zt): (14) Reset Gate (Rt): (15) where W are the weights, and σ represents the activation function. ht-1 are the hidden states. The stochastic nature of deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and GA, where random initializations and training processes can lead to variability in performance, makes it crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of our results [54]. We conducted repeated simulations to address this, running each model 10 times with different random seeds. We recorded the performance metrics for each run, including MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Eqs (18)–(21) provide the equations for these metrics. To statistically compare the performance metrics across different runs, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This non-parametric test is suitable for comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test does not assume normality, making it a robust choice for our analysis [55]. This test works by ranking the absolute differences between paired observations, assigning ranks, and then computing the sum of ranks for the positive and negative differences. The test statistic W is the smaller of these sums. The p-value is derived from the distribution of W under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the paired samples. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is calculated as follows: We collected the dataset containing information on net demand and consumption in the UK, covering the period from 2020 to 2023. While preparing the data, we apply techniques to handle missing data points, which are represented as NaN or null values within our dataset. To impute the missing values, we calculate the mean μ and median σ, that can effectively transform a feature set X from X = {x1, x2, …., xn} to , where x’i = xi if xi is not missing, and x'i = μ or σ otherwise. There are three categories of data transformation that are typically utilized in the neural network. In this model, we used linear transformation Eq (16), which scales the data either into (0 to 1) or (-1 to +1) range. In order to account for any differences in data behavior, the dataset is analyzed by classifying it according to temporal patterns, specifically by differentiating between weekdays and weekends. The entire dataset is divided into two parts. 80% of the data was chosen for training, while the remaining 20% was used for validation. Validation data is further refined by dividing data into four distinct samples (S1, S2, S3, S4), enabling a comprehensive evaluation that enhances the robustness and generalizability of findings. The dataset contains a total of 43 features, out of which, after applying GA, we got the four highly correlated features with the target feature for the training for our model. We have done exploratory analysis on these features to get better insights about the data. We separate a single feature on which we wish to make the prediction. In our case, it is Net Demand. We need to scale this feature, so we used the MinMaxScaler library of Python. The dataset did not contain any missing values. The two-month training graph shows a strong daily cyclical pattern with daytime peaks and nighttime drops, as shown in Fig 5. Energy demand ranges between 17,500 and 35,000 daily, showing no long-term trend. The graph’s density shows high-frequency data collection, providing an in-depth view of energy consumption trends with potential outliers from demand drops. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g005 We further illustrated the variations in net energy demand over weekdays and weekends in April and May 2023. It is possible to see a pattern of highs and lows that repeats itself every day, with times when demand rises and times when it falls. Demand changes a lot during the week, with higher levels of consumption during the day and lower levels of demand at night. This repetitive behavior can also be seen on the weekends, but the volume isn’t as strong. This could be because people use the system differently when they don’t have to work during the week Fig 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g006 Additionally, we used box plots to examine the distribution of energy generation features between weekdays and weekends. The visual representations shown in Fig 7 clearly illustrate a noticeable difference in the core tendencies and variabilities of the two temporal segments. The interquartile ranges shown indicate a greater level of uniformity in energy production patterns on weekdays compared to weekends, especially in the ‘GENERATION’ and ‘FOSSIL’ categories. Outliers, identified by the data points located outside the whiskers of the box plots, were present in both categories, indicating occasional deviations from the usual energy production levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g007 In this study, we have adopted a stacking approach for the regression problem, considering it the most appropriate, as discussed in [56]. The general structure of this method is illustrated in Fig 8. To define the stacking ensemble scheme more precisely, given P distinct learning algorithms Mh, for k = 1 to P, and the data pair 〈a, b〉 {a = (a1, …., az) representing the recorded z values and b = (az+1, …., az+k) k values to be predicted}, let , (for h = 1 to P, j = 1 to k) be the model generated by Mh to forecast az+j. The function gj, which combines these models for prediction, can be a standard function developed through another algorithm utilizing a machine learning system. The predicted value is then calculated using this method, Eq (17). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g008 In this work, we have employed and optimized various hyperparameters, such as Epoch, which represents a complete iteration of training data. Dropout mitigated the issue of overfitting. The learning rate refers to the pace at which the model updates its parameters during training. Batch size, on the other hand, represents the number of samples processed by the network at each iteration. The hidden layer, positioned between the input and output layers, determines the number of nodes it should contain. In order to optimize GPU utilization, we have implemented a batch size of 12. Additionally, we have chosen a dropout rate of 0.2 to mitigate overfitting. The dropout rate is 0.2. By removing 20% of the nodes in the hidden layer, we effectively minimize the occurrence of overfitting. The learning rate should not be very low; hence, the learning rate is adjusted to 0.1. After all these adjustments, we achieved a reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) to a level below 0.01, as shown in Fig 9. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g009 The efficacy of our study was evaluated using several variables [57]. The following procedures were used for each, and we have shown in these equations in Eqs (18), (19), (20), and (21) The accuracy of a model is calculated from MAPE. Our proposed method includes a multi-step process that starts with data preparation and culminates with evaluating the predictions. Technically, a common preprocessing formula for data preprocessing and feature selections is presented in Eqs (22) and (23), Here, D is the original dataset, Dp is the preprocessed dataset, and ∅ is the preprocessing function that includes data cleaning, transformation, normalization, and temporal feature extraction. Here Fs is the set of selected features, and GA is the Genetic Algorithm applied to Dp for feature selection. We deploy three base deep learning models, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, which we have already discussed in section 3.3. The LSTM model is adept at capturing long-term dependencies, the BiLSTM model leverages information from both past and future time points, and the GRU model efficiently models short-term dependencies shown in Eqs (24)–(26). Here, ht represents the hidden state at time t. The hidden states of each base learner are combined using a stacking ensemble approach with a linear regression meta-learner presented in Eqs (27) and (28), respectively. Here, H is the concatenated hidden states from each base learner, is the predicted energy demand, and β0, β1, β2, β3 are the coefficients learned by the meta-learner. When the whole procedure is expressed as an equation, it can be written as in Eq (29) (29) Fig 10 demonstrates the entire process of the proposed framework. The model comprises several stages. A thorough preprocessing procedure is applied to the dataset, which includes data cleaning to fix errors, data transformation to organize the information for analysis, variable standardization to make them more comparable, and temporal feature extraction to take advantage of trends that change over time. After the preprocessing is completed, a genetic algorithm is then used for feature selection. This computational evolution approach uses mutation and crossover to enhance the prediction skills of the feature set population, mimicking natural selection. The whole GA process is shown in Fig 1. We evaluate the fitness of each feature set based on how well it predicts energy use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g010 In the model implementation phase, three separate recurrent neural networks—GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM—are trained as the base models using the features that GA selected. We used a stacking ensemble approach to best use each neural network’s capabilities. A meta-model is trained in this ensemble to merge the forecasts of the GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM basis models into a single, more precise prediction. In the last stage, statistical matrices such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are used to measure the accuracy of forecasts and conduct a thorough evaluation of this composite model’s performance. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through multiple metrics, namely RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Detailed mathematical formulations for these evaluation metrics are provided in Section 4.6. In the dataset analyzed for this study, two distinct energy demand patterns were identified, as shown in Fig 6. The first pattern is associated with weekends, where a notable decrease in energy demand is observed. In contrast, the second pattern corresponds to weekdays, characterized by a consistent increase in energy demand. The data was systematically categorized according to these patterns, and the model was then trained to handle them effectively. The results of this comparative analysis are displayed in Fig 11 for the weekday pattern and in Fig 12 for the weekend pattern. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g012 After training the architecture presented in this study using the data patterns illustrated in Fig 6, we first tested the model on the training dataset. The outcomes of this test are detailed in Table 2. To further our objective, we then evaluated the model’s performance using a hidden validation dataset from the energy demand data. The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t003 An additional performance assessment was also conducted by dividing the entire validation dataset into four distinct samples. The model’s performance was then re-evaluated on each of these samples separately. The outcomes of these evaluations are documented in Fig 13 and Table 4. Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t004 In the final analysis, individual models using LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM architectures were developed for the identified demand patterns. Their comparative performance is illustrated in Fig 14. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g014 In Table 4, we provide a comprehensive evaluation, presenting the overall performance scores of all models across the four validation samples. Deep learning models are inherently stochastic, which means that they can produce different results on different executions. To demonstrate the reliability of our proposed model, we executed the entire program ten times. For each run, we recorded the error metrics, as shown in Tables 5 and 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t006 To determine if the differences in performance metrics across different runs were statistically significant, we applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results are summarized in Table 7. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t007 The p-values indicate whether there is a significant difference between the models’ performances over multiple runs. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a significant difference. In this case, the p-values for all comparisons (Ensemble vs. LSTM, Ensemble vs. BiLSTM, and Ensemble vs. GRU) across all metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are 0.001953125, which is significantly less than the 0.05 threshold. This demonstrates that the ensemble model consistently shows a statistically significant improvement in performance over the individual models. The prediction accuracy criteria for assessment are schematically shown in Fig 15. Most of the error lies around zero. Therefore, mathematical findings confirm the predicted accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g015 The findings indicate that the Stacking-GA model consistently achieves better results compared to the separate deep learning models in all criteria during both weekdays and weekends. In Sample S1 on weekdays, the Stacking-GA model had the lowest MAE (494.62) for weekdays Fig 16(A), and MAE (534.25) for weekends Fig 16(B), which indicates its improved predictive accuracy compared to the solo models. Similarly, the observed trend is stable in all samples, suggesting that the ensemble technique successfully captures the fundamental patterns in energy consumption. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g016 The RMSE values, which indicate the level of volatility in the predictions, drop in the following order: LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and Stacking-GA. This further highlights the resilience of the ensemble approach. Furthermore, the MAPE shown in Fig 17(A) and 17(B), and RMSE shown in Fig 18(A) and 18(B) provide additional evidence supporting the enhanced precision and dependability of the Stacking-GA model. The performance difference amongst the models is particularly evident on weekends, possibly indicating the enhanced challenge of predicting energy demand during these periods due to less predictable consumption patterns.

RMSE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g018 In summary, the Stacking-GA model demonstrates a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to individual deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. Due to the stochastic nature of these models, we conducted repeated simulations, running each model ten times with different random seeds and recording the performance metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) for each run. To ensure the reliability of our results, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare the performance metrics across the different runs. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test results, with p-values of 0.001953125 for all comparisons, indicate a statistically significant improvement in the performance of the ensemble model over the individual models across all metrics. The enhanced performance in energy demand forecasting is likely attributed to the combination of feature selection, ensemble learning, and the incorporation of a Genetic Algorithm. The ensemble deep learning framework proposed in this study has significant implications and potential applications in real-world energy demand forecasting scenarios. It provides accurate and robust forecasts, which are crucial for various stakeholders in the energy section. The ensemble framework, which combines the LSTM, BiLST, and GRU models, improves the accuracy of energy demand predictions. Better accuracy is crucial for utility firms, grid operators, and policymakers to make well-informed choices about energy generation, distribution, and management. Our method is adaptable to various forecasting horizons, whether short-term, medium-term, or long-term. This adaptability makes it suitable for different applications, such as day-ahead forecasting for grid operation, week-ahead forecasting for maintenance scheduling, and long-term forecasting for infrastructure planning. The use of a GA for feature selection allows the framework to handle complex and high-dimensional data efficiently. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data from smart meters, weather stations, and other sources need to be processed to generate accurate forecasts. With developments in real-time data collecting and processing technology, our ensemble framework may be integrated into smart grid systems to give real-time energy demand forecasts. This has the potential to increase energy distribution efficiency and reliability while also making it easier to integrate distributed energy resources. This research presents a significant advancement in energy demand forecasting by introducing an innovative stacking ensemble approach. The integration of LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM networks, underpinned by a genetic algorithm for feature selection, marks a novel methodology in addressing the complexities of energy demand prediction. We have also utilized the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for statistical validation and ran the simulations ten times to ensure our results hold up. The performance evaluation was conducted using three key metrics: RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. To ensure the model’s robustness against the variability in energy consumption patterns, the data was segmented into weekday and weekend categories for analysis. The results from the validation data highlight the model’s exceptional precision, with a weekday performance marked by an RMSE of 130.6, a MAPE of 0.38%, and an MAE of 99.41. For weekend projections, the model maintained its accuracy, recording an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This level of precision indicates the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complexities of energy demand patterns. Additionally, The use of a genetic algorithm for feature selection has proven to be a key factor in the model’s success. It efficiently identifies the most influential predictors, improving the model’s performance. Furthermore, The stacking-based ensemble model, integrating multiple deep learning techniques, showcases a robust framework that outperforms traditional single-model approaches in forecasting accuracy. The study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of feature selection in machine learning but also offers practical implications for energy analysts and policymakers. Enhancing the accuracy of energy demand forecasts aids in efficient energy management and planning, which is crucial in the context of growing energy needs and sustainability challenges.

Title: Meta's performance-based cuts could kick off a wider trend in tech

Hello there! Business Insider's Alistair Barr thought he was doing the right thing when he discouraged a colleague from joining a little-known startup back in 2016. Turns out he was wrong. Really wrong. The startup was OpenAI, and the former colleague, who thankfully didn't listen, is now an AI billionaire. In today's big story, Meta is looking to quickly get rid of low performers with companywide cuts as it prepares for what Mark Zuckerberg says will be an "intense year." What's on deck Markets: The saga of finding Jamie Dimon's replacement takes another twist. Tech: Microsoft employees across multiple divisions have been laid off. Business: President-elect Donald Trump announces plans for an external revenue service. But first, on the chopping block. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tired: Move fast and break things. Wired: Move fast and get rid of underperformers. Two years after Mark Zuckerberg's famous "Year of Efficiency" the Meta CEO is ratcheting things up a notch. The tech giant announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce with a focus on the lowest performers, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann and Hugh Langley report. Based on Meta's most-recent earnings report, that would amount to about 3,600 roles. In a memo to staff, Zuckerberg said the company is entering an "intense year" and the decision was made to "move out low-performers faster." So how does Meta plan on doing that? Jyoti and Pranav Dixit got their hands on an internal memo from a human-resources executive explaining how the job cuts will work. The key is reaching a 5% non-regrettable attrition rate this year. In case you don't speak HR mumbo jumbo, that describes workers Meta wouldn't mind losing. To get there, Meta managers will need to identify 12-15% of employees with performance ratings of "Met Most Expectations" or worse. Those who receive ratings of "Met Some" and "Did not Meet" will definitely be fired while those with a "Met Most" rating will be further evaluated by a director and VP before a decision is made. They won't have a lot of time to do it. Employees based in the US will find out about the cuts by February 10. Meta employees had plenty of questions about the strategy. Some got behind the idea. One wrote on an internal message board viewed by Jyoti and Hugh that "there is a need to raise the bar and I absolutely support this." Others, however, weren't as optimistic. Some wondered how — dare I say — efficient the process would be. The process is "marginally better than 'monkey's throwing darts,'" another employee wrote. Like it or not, it might be here to stay. An internal FAQ document viewed by BI hints that performance-related layoffs could become an annual tradition at Meta. The bigger question is whether the approach catches on at other companies. You could argue Zuckerberg's 2023 efficiency push kicked off a wider trend. (Or maybe it was bound to happen anyway.) Regular performance-based cuts aren't the standard in tech like they are in other industries, but they also aren't unheard of. Amazon, in particular, has leaned on performance-improvement plans in recent years. 1. Crypto might be a lot of things, but a currency isn't one of them. For all the attention digital currencies like bitcoin have gotten over the years, the likelihood they'll replace money (as some predicted) still seems farfetched. BI's Adam Rogers writes about how crypto has just become another way for people to gamble. 2. JPMorgan and BlackRock shake-up their executive ranks. Daniel Pinto, the bank's president and COO, will step down in June and plans to retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak, currently a co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, will replace Pinto as COO. The promotion isn't about CEO Jamie Dimon grooming a successor, though. Piepszak doesn't want the top job, leading to more questions about Dimon's succession plans. Meanwhile, the race to succeed another Wall Street titan — BlackRock's Larry Fink — took a turn with the departure of Mark Wiedman, who was widely viewed as a top candidate for the job. 3. What the Los Angeles wildfires mean for the economy. AccuWeather estimates the total economic cost could reach $275 billion. Goldman Sachs says it could rank as one of the costliest natural disasters as a share of GDP in US history. However, the bank isn't concerned about higher insurance costs meaningfully impacting inflation. In the meantime, here's a rundown on who could foot the enormous bill. 1. TikTok's fate hangs in the balance. US users are flocking to the Chinese app RedNote, and TikTok Shop sellers are testing out other e-marketplaces. Selling the app to an American owner isn't out of the question, though — there are reports that Chinese officials are considering an eleventh-hour sale to Elon Musk. MuskTok? Sure, why not. 2. Apple takes a hit despite launching AI iPhones. The tech giant had a standout 2024 with the debut of Apple Intelligence and the Vision Pro. However, its global market share of smartphone sales slipped due to the iPhone losing ground to competitors and its new AI feature not being available in Greater China — one of the company's major markets. 3. Exclusive: Layoffs sweep Microsoft. Employees in security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming faced job cuts, two people familiar with the matter told BI. The layoffs are separate from the recent cuts targeting low-performers within the company, which BI previously reported. 1. Justin Baldoni's New York Times lawsuit could hinge on an emoji. The "It Ends With Us" director accused the paper of taking his publicists' quotes out of context. He said the paper omitted an emoji — an upside-down smile — that would've made it clear his publicist was being sarcastic, not serious. 2. Trump's got tax plans, but Congress holds the strings. The president-elect vowed to create an "external revenue service" to collect tariffs and revenue from foreign nations on Day One. It's not clear how the new agency would work, but establishing it would require congressional approval. Back home, Americans could see their tax bills change this year since Trump's 2017 package is set to expire. 3. Come for the coffee, stay for the refills. Starbucks announced all its customers — not just rewards members — can get free refills of many brewed coffee and tea drinks at participating stores starting January 27. But the freebies end there, as the company is closing the door on its open-door policy that allows non-paying guests to use store facilities. Gold is one of the 'least effective' inflation hedges, according to Goldman Sachs. Here are three investments that actually protect your portfolio.

Posted on January 15, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment Are you looking to build your website but don’t know where to start? In 2025, do-it-yourself web design will be more accessible than ever, offering cost-effective solutions, complete control over the look and feel of your site, and the chance to learn valuable new skills. However, taking the DIY route requires a time commitment and a willingness to learn. In this post, we’ll provide some helpful tips to guide you through the process, from planning your site’s structure to optimizing it for search engines. We’ll also introduce you to the top tools, like Divi, to build a website independently. Let’s get started. In this section, we’ll outline several key tips to help you create a successful website. These tips cover everything from planning and platform selection to design principles, user experience, content creation, and basic SEO. Following these guidelines, you’ll be well-equipped to build a professional and effective website, even with limited design experience. Before you dive into do-it-yourself web design or choose a platform for your website, you have to start with a solid plan. This crucial step will save you time, prevent potential headaches, and ensure your website does what you want it to do. Think of it as the blueprint for your website. Three key steps are defining your website’s purpose and goals, defining your target audience, and creating a basic outline. First and foremost, define your website’s purpose and goals. Decide your website’s goals by asking yourself a few questions. Do you wish to sell products or services, share your expertise or thoughts, generate leads, or provide information? Clearly defining your purchase will help guide you on the design, content, and overall strategy. Every website should have its niche, so spend time figuring that out before doing anything else. Another important part of the planning stage is defining your ideal customer. Are you looking to target users by demographics (age, location, gender, etc.), interests, or needs? Knowing your audience will help you choose appropriate content and images. Let’s face it: a website targeting younger adults will likely have a different look and feel than one targeting senior citizens. Finally, create a sitemap or basic outline of your site. A sitemap is a visual representation of your website’s structure and hierarchy. It maps out all of the pages on your site and how they connect. Creating a sitemap helps you organize your content, visualize the user experience, and help search engines understand your website’s structure. Take a look at the example sitemap flowchart below. As you can see, it does a good job of showcasing how users will use your site. By starting with a well-defined plan, you’ll set yourself up for success as you progress through the stages of do-it-yourself web design. With a plan in place, the next decision you’ll need to make is choosing the right platform for your site. There are two main options: website builders and content management systems (CMS). Understanding their differences is essential for making the best choice for your needs. Website builders like Wix or Squarespace, are user-friendly platforms designed for beginners with little to no design experience. They offer drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-designed templates and typically serve as an all-in-one platform with hosting included. Content management systems, like WordPress, are more powerful platforms that provide much more flexibility and control over your website. While they may initially require a slightly higher learning curve, they offer significantly more options and the ability to scale as your site grows. While website builders offer a good starting point for simple websites, we strongly recommend WordPress for its versatility and long-term potential. WordPress is an incredibly powerful platform that can create virtually any type of website, from blogs to business websites to e-commerce stores. Its open-source nature, vast community, and extensive library of themes and plugins make it the most flexible and scalable option for do-it-yourself web design. While learning may require more effort, the long-term benefits and control you gain are well worth it. The rest of this post will focus on tips and tricks for building a website with WordPress. Get WordPress Selecting the right hosting provider is an important decision that can directly impact your website’s performance, security, and overall success. A hosting provider stores your website’s files and makes them accessible to visitors. While there are several hosting types, each caters to different needs and budgets. In do-it-yourself web design, picking the right host is one of the most important decisions you can make. You might choose several types of hosting providers, including shared, VPS, managed, and cloud. The one you decide upon depends on the type of website you want now and in the future. To help you decide, here’s a brief overview of each hosting type and who it is best suited to: As the most affordable option, shared hosting shares server resources (RAM, CPU, and storage) with many other websites. It’s suitable for small websites with low to moderate traffic. Remember that performance can be affected if other websites on the server experience a spike in traffic or resource usage. A virtual private server (VPS) provides a virtual server that is separated from other users on the same physical server. It gives you more control over resources and better performance than shared hosting. VPS hosting is a good option for websites that require more resources and server customization. Managed WordPress hosting is specifically optimized for WordPress websites. It includes automatic updates, enhanced security, caching, a content delivery network (CDN), and a staging environment. Managed WordPress hosting is great for WordPress users who want to simplify website management and need enhanced performance. Cloud hosting uses a network of interconnected servers to host your website. It offers excellent scalability, reliability, and uptime. If one server goes down, another can take over, ensuring your website never goes down. There are a few factors to consider when choosing the best hosting provider. First is your website’s size and traffic requirements. Shared hosting might be a good fit for a small website with low traffic. However, as your website grows, you may need to update to a more robust solution, like VPS hosting. This decision is an important one in the process of do-it-yourself web design. You’ll also need to consider your level of technical expertise. VPS may be the way to go if you’re comfortable with server management. However, if you prefer a more hands-off approach where everything is handled for you, managed WordPress hosting is a good option. For those new to do-it-yourself web design, managed hosting can simplify the process. Finally, you have to consider the cost. Shared hosting is the most affordable option, with VPS, cloud, and managed all starting around the same price point. Choosing the right hosting plan for your budget is key for do-it-yourself web design projects. We recommend two good providers based on performance, reliability, customer support, and value for the money: SiteGround and Cloudways. SiteGround is known for its fast servers, customer support, and WordPress-specific features. They offer managed hosting plans with automatic updates, daily backups, a CDN, free SSL, and much more, starting at $2.99 monthly for the first year. After that, you’ll pay around $18 monthly, which is still a great deal for everything you’ll get. Get SiteGround Another great option is Cloudways. They offer managed cloud hosting, allowing you to choose from cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, and Google. They provide a user-friendly interface for managing your server and offer features like caching, staging, robust security features, and the ability to scale your server with the click of a button. If you want a host that will grow with you, Cloudways is the perfect option. Get Cloudways Once you’ve settled on hosting, the next step is to choose a theme. WordPress themes dictate your website’s overall look and feel, influencing its design, layout, and functionality. While WordPress offers an extensive library of free themes, we strongly recommend a premium theme, like Divi, as the ultimate solution for do-it-yourself web design. Divi is more than just a theme; it’s a powerful page builder that allows you to create websites without coding. It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, the Visual Builder, thousands of pre-designed layouts, and extensive customization options, making it the perfect tool for beginners and do-it-yourself web designers. Divi stands out from other WordPress themes for several reasons. Its Visual Builder lets you see your designs in real time as you create them. Drag one of Divi’s 200+ design modules onto the page, adjust its nearly unlimited customization options, and see the results instantly. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ In addition to building your site with design modules, Divi offers Divi Quick Sites, which allows you to create your site from a collection of pre-made starter sites or through an AI-generated site, thanks to Divi AI. Provide a short description of your site, and Divi will build it in minutes. Every Divi Quick Site has all content, web pages, images, global styles, and a menu. It’s a quick way to create a beautiful website in a short amount of time with limited effort. Divi gives you complete control over every aspect of your site’s design. You can customize colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds, and more. You can also create dynamic templates for your header, footer, blog posts, and more, thanks to Divi’s Theme Builder. This level of customization allows you to create a unique and professional website that reflects your brand, attracts new customers, and encourages them to act. If you plan to sell products and services on your site, you’ll benefit from Divi‘s built-in support for WooCommerce. Divi comes with 20+ Woo modules that allow you to customize every step of the purchase process, from the product to checkout. Combining the power of Visual Builder, Theme Builder, and WooCommerce, you can easily design and build stunning product, shop, and checkout pages. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ By choosing Divi, you’re not just choosing a theme; you’re choosing a complete website-building platform that allows you to create beautiful, functional websites without coding. It’s also one of the most cost-effective solutions you’ll find. For just $89 per year, you can build unlimited Divi websites and manage them through Divi Dash, Divi’s all-in-one site management tool. Divi Dash allows you to manage all your websites, their software, and clients in one convenient location. Get Divi User experience (UX) should be front and center regarding do-it-yourself web design. UX refers to a user’s overall experience while interacting with your website. It involves everything from how easily users can find information to how enjoyable their interactions are. A positive user experience increases engagement, higher conversion rates, and improved customer satisfaction. On the other hand, poor UX can lead to frustration, abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand. Several key factors contribute to a positive UX, so we’ll focus on navigation, mobile responsiveness, and page load speed. Effective navigation is the backbone of a good user experience. It allows users to find what they are looking for easily. Here are some tips for creating clear and intuitive navigation: Mobile users expect a seamless experience on their devices. A responsive website provides just that, making it easy for them to browse your content, navigate your site, and complete desired actions. There are some SEO benefits to responsive design, too. This is because Google uses a mobile-first algorithm that prioritizes mobile-friendly sites when displaying search results. This is especially important for do-it-yourself web design, where you are responsible for all aspects of your site. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ As mentioned, using a good WordPress theme like Divi can give you a tremendous edge in this department. Divi is inherently responsive, meaning any website built with it will automatically adapt to different screen sizes. For even more control, you can use the responsive controls built into Divi to make the necessary design tweaks to make it perfect. Ensuring your site loads fast is another key principle of UX design. Slow loading times can lead to frustration, high bounce rates (users leaving your website), and negatively impacting your search engine rankings. To help you keep your site running smoothly, consider using a fast hosting provider like SiteGround. In addition to hosting, there are a few other ways to ensure your site loads quickly for your users, including: While Divi provides the tools to build a website easily, understanding fundamental design principles is crucial for creating a visually appealing and effective website. This is especially important for do-it-yourself web design, where you take on the entire design process. Design principles use elements like color, typography, and images to create a cohesive look and feel. Stock photo subscriptions can be expensive. Thankfully, there are several free stock image sites you can use to build your website: Divi AI offers a compelling alternative to traditional stock photo platforms. It can generate unique, custom images based on text prompts. This means you can create images that perfectly match your content and brand without relying on generic stock photos. Divi AI can save you time and money while ensuring your website has relevant images and vectors that engage users. One of the best aspects of Divi AI is that there are no limitations on how many images you can generate. This starkly contrasts with other AI generators that provide a credit-based system for creating images. With Divi AI, you can generate as many as you’d like and never worry about running out of credits. Divi AI is offered as a companion product to Divi. You can sign up for access starting at $16.08 per month. Get Divi AI Regarding do-it-yourself web design, the adage “content is king” remains as true as ever. While a visually appealing site is important for attracting visitors, the content keeps them engaged and coming back for more. High-quality, relevant content is the foundation of a successful website, driving traffic, building domain authority, and achieving your online goals. Here’s why high-quality, relevant content is so important: If you’re looking for an easy way to write SEO-optimized content for your website, Divi AI can help. Divi AI is more than just a website and image generator. It can create content, too, making it a great tool for the do-it-yourself web designer. While it doesn’t replace the need for strategic thinking and human oversight, it can be a powerful tool for streamlining content creation and ensuring basic SEO elements are in place. You can provide Divi AI with text prompts related to a topic, including relevant keywords, the tone of writing you’d like, and even the content length. The AI then generates content based on input, incorporating the keywords you specify throughout the text. Divi AI will create headlines, body copy, product descriptions, and more. Another critical aspect of do-it-yourself web design is learning some basic search engine optimization (SEO). When someone searches for information related to your business or website, SEO helps ensure your site appears as high as possible in the search results. Increased visibility can increase your website’s organic (non-paid) traffic. SEO is important for a few reasons. Aside from increased visibility, SEO helps you attract users actively seeking information or products related to your business. Websites that rank high in search results are perceived as more credible and trustworthy, giving customers peace of mind to interact with or purchase from you. SEO is also a very cost-effective form of marketing. Compared to paid advertising, SEO can be a cheaper way to drive traffic to your site over the long term. Here are some fundamental practices that every do-it-yourself web designer should understand: Keyword research involves identifying your target audience’s words and phrases when searching for information related to your business. Tools like Semrush, KWFinder, and SE Ranking can help you find relevant keywords. Understanding what people are searching for allows you to tailor and optimize your content to the right people. On-page optimization involves optimizing elements within your website itself. This includes key areas like title tags, meta descriptions, URLs, and content. During your keyword research, you’ll want to select a primary keyword. Opt for relevant keywords with high search volume and aren’t overly competitive. Choosing a highly competitive keyword can cause you to struggle to rank high in search results. Once you’ve selected a relevant keyword, include it throughout your content (page or post). Include it in the page or post’s title, the URL (permalink), and the meta description. A word of caution, though: avoid keyword stuffing. Using your chosen keyword too often throughout your content can lead to poor placement in SERPs, loss of credibility, and poor user experience. Lastly, assign images to your posts and pages, and add alt text. Another effective way to boost your SEO is through link building. This involves acquiring links from other reputable websites and blogs that link to your website. These links act as votes of confidence and can significantly improve your search engine rankings. Building high-quality backlinks requires effort and strategy, focusing on earning links from relevant and authoritative sources. Thorough testing and feedback are critical before launching your new website, especially for do-it-yourself web design. This step helps identify and fix user experience, functionality, or performance issues. Launching a website without testing is like releasing a product without quality control – it can lead to frustration for users, damage your reputation, and limit your site’s success. Testing allows you to catch and resolve potential issues, including: Several tools can help you test your website, including browser developer tools, Google PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix, and more. Most modern web browsers like Chrome and Safari have built-in developer tools to help you test responsiveness, spy console errors, and performance. Similarly, tools like Google’s Mobile Friendly test check your site for responsiveness and recommend improvements. Finally, you can use Google Page Speed Insights, GTMetrix, or Pingdom to analyze your website’s performance and provide detailed reports on page load speed and other core web vitals. These tools are invaluable resources for anyone engaged in do-it-yourself web design. Another important part of the testing process is to gather feedback about your website. Ask friends, family, or colleagues to test your website and provide honest feedback. Remember that most of your friends/family will need guidance on what to look for, so provide them with a list of questions to answer. Start with simple questions: Encourage them to be as specific as possible when answering. After all, their perspective can help you identify issues you might have overlooked. Creating a website has never been easier or more rewarding. It’s a chance to express your creativity and gain valuable new skills. From initial planning and choosing the right platform to focusing on user experience (UX) and search engine optimization (SEO), you have access to everything you need to build a strong online presence. Powerful tools like the Divi theme and its innovative AI companion, Divi AI, empower anyone to create professional websites with stunning visuals and SEO-friendly content. With these strategies and resources, you can successfully embrace do-it-yourself web design and quickly build your website. Explore plans, pricing and features.

Title: 6 Foods You Should Be Buying in Bulk, According to an Expert
URL: https://www.cnet.com/home/6-foods-you-should-be-buying-in-bulk-according-to-an-expert/

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Bulk groceries cost significantly less. Here are six staples you can stockpile for the next several months. We asked an expert about the best foods to buy in bulk. The price of groceries still remains a hot topic. According to a recent CNET survey, it's still the No. 1 source of sticker shock for Americans, myself included. We've covered numerous ways to save a little money in your grocery budget: food saving apps such as Flashfood; the difference in cost between name brand and store brand groceries; and whether shopping at Trader Joe's results in meaningful savings over other grocery chains. And, of course, there's buying in bulk. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's what an expert told me about food expiration dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $7.99, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $12.99 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $22.99, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

Rigetti Computing (RGTI, Financial) shares shot 48% higher on Tuesday after B. Riley reaffirmed the 'Buy' rating and raised the price target to $8.50 from $4.00. It comes on the heels of the company's renewed hopes of commercializing the quantum computing sector. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RGTI. Those gains illustrate investor confidence in Rigetti's both intermediate and long-term potential, even given recent market volatility driven by comments from Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) CEO Jensen Huang about the 'very useful' prospects for quantum computers. Regarding Rigetti, "the key driver here is that they have overlooked technical things that are really important," said Craig Ellis of B. Riley, an analyst who cited the scalability of quantum systems for high-value workloads that simply aren't accessible by traditional technologies. Ellis noted that Rigetti's equity capital raises in the fourth quarter of 2024 clearly alleviated prior cash sufficiency concerns, allaying a huge hurdle for the company's growth. Rigetti's investment appeal was also strengthened by his highlighting the company's position as a could-be leader in government-related quantum computing adoption. The analyst acknowledged technical scale-up hurdles and long delays to profitability and countered that rising interest in so-called frontier technologies beyond artificial intelligence could drive up Rigetti's growth. We also pointed to key factors to watch in the years ahead, which included the maturing of the quantum ecosystem and more commercial engagement. Rigetti's strong showing comes as broader quantum computing stocks rebound from a period of under pressure over the past few years. This progress could put the company in a strong position to become a key player in the fast-developing quantum world. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Morgan Stanley: “[TSMC’s] Customers Like AMD And Broadcom Are Releasing CoWoS-S Capacity Due To Weaker Demand,” Allowing NVIDIA To “Convert This Capacity To CoWoS-L For GB300A Production”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few days, the proverbial waters have become quite murky due to the lack of visibility over TSMC's supposed travails related to its bespoke wafer-level system integration platform, CoWoS. Now, however, analysts at Morgan Stanley have stepped up to offer some much-needed clarity on this topic and its implications, if any, on NVIDIA's product roll out. As per a recent report by The Information, NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers purportedly continue to face overheating and glitching issues, apparently prompting the chipmaker's mega customers, including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, to pare their respective Blackwell orders. The report went on to note that Blackwell's woes stem from the "way [those] chips connect," alluding to a possible flaw within TSMC's bespoke advanced packaging solution, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), which enables the integration of multiple chips into a single package. This report struck a nerve with investors, especially as NVIDIA had declared back in 2024 that it was able to rectify Blackwell's performance-related teething issues by implementing minor changes to the photomask, a specific template that is used to create patterns on chip wafers. However, soon after, DigiTimes calmed perturbed investors by leveraging its internal sources within TSMC to report that, contrary to The Information's report, TSMC has "maintained" its existing Blackwell orders, negating the rumored decrease in orders from NVIDIA's mega customers. Morgan Stanley’s view on TSMC’s CoWoS order fluctuations highlights that some customers, like $AMD and Broadcom, are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand. $NVDA, however, has stepped in and requested $TSM to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production.… https://t.co/jneCfh0goi — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 15, 2025 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh note, shedding some much-needed additional light on this topic. According to the Wall Street titan, some TSMC customers, including AMD and Broadcom, "are releasing CoWoS-S capacity due to weaker demand." This aligns with a separate note penned by Nomura, which notes that NVIDIA "could slash CoWoS-S orders from TSMC and UMC by up to 80% in 2025 due to weaker demand for Hopper platform chips." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's Hopper chips utilize TSMC's CoWoS-S tech while the newer Blackwell chips leverage the global chip fabrication giant's CoWoS-L packaging tech. Coming back, Morgan Stanley then goes on to note that, in light of CoWoS-S capacity cancelations, NVIDIA "has stepped in and requested TSMC to convert this capacity to CoWoS-L for GB300A production." Morgan Stanley also declares: "Despite these shifts, TSMC’s overall CoWoS demand remains steady, with a slight potential increase in GB300A production later this year." This means that The Information's report might have been partially correct: there have been order cancelations at TSMC. However, as clarified by Morgan Stanley, the cancelations only affect orders that leverage TSMC’s CoWoS-S packaging technology and that NVIDIA's Blackwell orders likely remain unaffected.

Title: Hold onto your current job if you want to keep working remotely
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-hybrid-work-from-home-jobs-persisting-fewer-new-roles-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-15T09:15:02Z

Americans who want to keep their work-from-home arrangements may need to cling to their jobs. Corporate giants like Amazon, AT&T, and JPMorgan have notified employees they must return to the office five days a week this year. This comes as the share of remote and hybrid postings on job platforms has ticked down in recent years — which has made landing one of these roles more difficult. As of November, the share of postings on Indeed for remote and hybrid jobs had declined to 7.8% from over 10% in 2022, according to the platform's data. On LinkedIn, the share of remote or hybrid postings had declined to roughly 21% as of December, down from 26% two years prior. But remote and hybrid jobs haven't faded away. In December, roughly 23% of US workers worked from home at least part of the time, up from about 19% two years prior, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, about 10% worked completely from home. "We keep hearing stories that 'work from home is over,' and while, yes, it is true for some firms, others must be doing the reverse," Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist and cofounder of the remote-work-research website WFH Research, told Business Insider. Bloom's research has found that the share of paid full days worked from home in the US has been fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bloom and other economists told BI that the divide between remote or hybrid job postings and work-from-home rates suggested that some employers could be prioritizing in-person hires while letting some of their existing employees continue working more flexibly. They said this strategy could allow companies to boost their in-office attendance without drawing the ire of employees who've grown used to a remote or hybrid arrangement. "We know that companies frequently make exceptions to return-to-office mandates for employees to avoid losing them, so policy changes might affect new hires more than incumbent employees," Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told BI. This approach would allow workers to retain their flexible work arrangements — but make it more difficult for them to snag a remote or hybrid role at another company, Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn's Economic Graph Research Institute, told BI. "If you already have a job and you are grandfathered into this flexible work, you're maintaining it in a lot of cases," Kantenga said. "Companies are using those new positions to roll that flexible work back a little bit, but they're not necessarily rolling it back for the workers who already have it." Even if more businesses prioritize in-person hiring, it could take awhile for work-from-home rates to fall significantly, Lisa Simon, the chief economist at Revelio Labs, said. That's because hiring, layoffs, and resignations have slowed, which means that "very few people have actually changed jobs in the last two years" and businesses haven't added many new workers who would be subject to recent RTO mandates, Simon told BI. However, the modest share of available remote or hybrid jobs could be somewhat misleading. Simon said that a slowdown in hiring for white-collar roles — where flexible working arrangements are more common — could be pushing down remote and hybrid job postings. Additionally, Bloom said some companies might not want to commit to a flexible working arrangement in the job posting but could ultimately allow the employee to work from home at least some of the time. "They don't want to repeat the 2021 mistake of promising generous work from home only to have to painfully reverse this later," he said. Bloom added that for some roles — like university professors — working from home on days when they don't have classes is a norm of the job. However, a job posting might not classify this position as remote or hybrid. Pollak said remote and hybrid roles are generally underrepresented in job postings because they tend to have lower turnover than the typical in-person job. "A hotel may replace its entire staff of janitors three times a year but only replace its remote customer-support staff every two years," she said.

Title: Washington Post in CRISIS: Resignations, retrenchment and revenue slump

The Washington Post (WaPo) suffered a $100 million revenue loss in 2024, primarily due to a massive decline in digital readership, dropping from 22.5 million daily users to just 2.5 to three million. In response to financial struggles, WaPo laid off approximately 100 employees. The paper also experienced significant staff resignations, including high-profile editors and columnists, following the decision not to endorse Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. The publication's credibility and influence have been severely eroded by internal conflicts over editorial decisions such as not endorsing Harris, which led to a loss of 250,000 paid subscribers. Bezos's decision not to endorse Harris, which he defended in an op-ed, sparked a significant exodus of long-time staffers further damaging the publication's reputation and newsroom. WaPo's struggles highlight the challenges faced by traditional media outlets in a polarized and digital-first media landscape, raising questions about its ability to regain stability.

WaPo's struggles highlight the challenges faced by traditional media outlets in a polarized and digital-first media landscape, raising questions about its ability to regain stability. The Washington Post (WaPo), once a bastion of American journalism, finds itself in a state of unprecedented decline as it grapples with a staggering $100 million revenue loss in 2024 and a near-collapse of its digital readership. WaPo's struggles are emblematic of a publication caught between shifting political tides and internal turmoil. During the peak of the 2024 presidential election, the newspaper's website averaged just 2.5 million to three million daily visitors â a stark contrast to the 22.5 million daily users it boasted at the start of the Biden administration. This 87 percent decline in digital traffic has had a devastating impact on the paper's bottom line, with subscription and ad revenue plummeting by $100 million in 2024 alone. The resulting loss of revenue has forced WaPo to lay off roughly 100 employees this month, marking yet another chapter in its ongoing financial and editorial crisis. The layoffs impacted about four percent of the publication's workforce and primarily targeted business divisions. (Related: Washington Post to lay off nearly 100 employees in latest round of cuts.) A WaPo spokesperson said the publication "is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." They added: "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position the Post for the future." The paper's woes were further compounded when it lost 250,000 paid subscribers in a single blow after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intervened to block an endorsement of outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle. The decision not to endorse Harris, a move that broke with decades of tradition, sparked a wave of resignations and internal dissent. Bezos defended his decision not to endorse the Democrat in an October op-ed, writing that "presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election." Later, the Amazon founder insisted that his refusal to back Harris "was the right decision" he was "proud" to have chosen. WaPo faces credibility crisis with staff resignations While Bezos defended his decision not to endorse Harris, the WaPo newsroom did not take too kindly to it. Many longtime staffers left the paper including Robert Kagan, the paper's editor-at-large. Kagan, the husband of former Department of State official Victoria Nuland, stepped down in October. Several staffers followed suit and handed in their resignation letters. Managing editor Matea Gold and reporters Josh Dawsey, Michael Scherer, Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager jumped ship and joined other mainstream media publications. WaPo was also rocked by two resignations this month. Columnist Jennifer Rubin announced her exit just days before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, lambasting the paper for failing to uphold its journalistic mission. "Bezos and his cronies accommodate and enable the most acute threat to American democracy â Donald Trump â at a time when a vibrant free press is more essential than ever to our democracyâs survival and capacity to thrive," Rubin wrote in her resignation letter. Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes also resigned after WaPo refused to publish her satirical cartoon depicting Bezos and other Big Tech figures groveling before Trump. These departures have left the publication's newsroom and editorial sections severely depleted, further eroding its credibility and influence. WaPo's decline is a cautionary tale for legacy media outlets navigating an increasingly polarized and fragmented media landscape. Once a symbol of journalistic excellence, the paper now struggles to retain readers, revenue, and relevance. Its slogan, "Democracy Dies in Darkness," rings hollow as WaPo itself teeters on the brink of irrelevance. Whether Bezos can steer the publication back to stability or whether it will continue its downward spiral remains an open question. For now, WaPo's future looks as uncertain as the democracy it claims to defend.

January 14, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

Read more Gold prices steadied in yesterday’s session, as market participants digested latest US inflation data as well as a report on President-elect Donald Trump’s planned trade tariffs. US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today. Updates regarding a ceasefire deal yesterday between Israel and Hamas capped some gains for precious metal, any further updates on the same could weigh on prices. Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

The department store chain said consolidated net profit rose nearly 41 per cent to 522.3 million rupees ($6.03 million) for the third quarter ended December 31 from 368.5 million rupees a year ago.

WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 9.33.07 AM.jpeg The Nifty’s bounce yesterday has created a “bullish harami” formation given the Monday drop which is similar to what was seen on January 7 and means that bulls have to push the index through 23340 for a larger advance. The 17th to 23rd January time window is nearing, so support in the 22830 - 23000 area and resistance in the 23355 - 23470 zone will be watched closely. While our prop oscillators on the daily and the weekly continue to be bearish, the former has now entered oversold territory. Any extension of yesterday’s rebound needs to hold the Monday low of 23047.

Key Highlights: 1. EU plans to ban Russian primary aluminium imports in new sanctions. 2. The sanctions mark the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. 3. Aluminium imports from Russia to the EU dropped to 6% in 2024. 4. Alternative supplies from UAE and Bahrain gain attention. 5. LME aluminium prices reached $2,602 before settling at $2,576.50. The European Union is set to propose a ban on Russian primary aluminium imports in its 16th sanctions package, marking the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. This measure follows reduced Russian aluminium imports, which fell to 6% of total EU aluminium demand in 2024. While U.S. and UK bans have intensified the supply shift, the EU seeks alternatives from Middle Eastern producers like the UAE and Bahrain. The news initially pushed LME aluminium prices to a one-month high of $2,602 before settling at $2,576.50, reflecting market uncertainties. * AARTIIND * ANGELONE * BANDHANBANK * HINDCOPPER * LTFIN * RBLBANK Optiemus: Company partners Taiwan-based KunWay Technology to Drive Drone Manufacturing Localization in India.

In the US, Producer prices increased 0.2% mom (+3.3% YoY) in Dec-24, below 0.4% in November which was the biggest gain in five months, and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.4% YoY). Meanwhile, the core PPI was unchanged, following a 0.2% rise (+3.5%YoY) in Nov and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.8%YoY). On the fiscal front in the U.S. government posted an $87 billion budget deficit in December, reduced partly by a shift of benefit payments into November but capping a record $711 billion deficit for the first three months of the 2025 fiscal year, On the domestic front, India’s wholesale prices increased by 2.37% yoy in December 2024, accelerating from a 1.89% rise in November, slightly above forecasts of a 2.30% gain. This was due to faster rises in manufacturing prices amid a softer fall in fuel prices. Primary articles saw faster growth (6.02% vs 5.49% in Nov), and manufacturing prices accelerated to a 23-month high (2.14% vs 2.00%). In view of ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India aims to boost its textile and garments industry in next month’s budget with financial support, tariff cuts on key inputs and incentives to produce locally, two government sources said. The government may also raise the allocation for production-linked incentives for the textile sector to around 600 million rupees from 450 million rupees for the current fiscal year, the source said. Moreover the government is likely to forecast nominal economic growth of 10.3 per cent-10.5 per cent, according to one of the officials. That’s higher than the forecast of 9.7 per cent for the current year to end-March given by the government’s statistical department this month.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024.

FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY).

It facilitates seamless transportation for 6.7 billion passengers annually—equivalent to the world’s population—and handles 27% of India’s freight movement. The sector is undergoing a significant transformation, supported by a record ₹2.52 lakh crore in government capital expenditure for FY 2024-25. Initiatives include the transition to safer, more efficient rolling stock, station upgrades, high-speed rail projects, and the adoption of renewable energy solutions like solar installations, aligning with sustainability goals while reducing operational costs.

The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).
