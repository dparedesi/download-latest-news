Charles Hoskinson, a founder of Ethereum and the driving force behind Cardano, laid out a sweeping forecast for crypto markets and payments this week. He predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the current market cycle and said the token’s total market value might hit $10 trillion in the next five years. Reports have disclosed that he links that outlook to new US stablecoin rules and what he calls clearer market structure. In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s design made it strong as a store of value but limited as a global payments rail. He pointed to the old “big block” debates that pushed the network toward saving rather than everyday payments. Layer Two solutions, he said, are where Bitcoin gains the speed and lower cost needed for daily use. This framing leaves room for other blockchains to offer broader financial services. Hoskinson framed Cardano as an alternative path — one built on research and formal methods rather than rapid experimentation. Based on reports, the network has operated continuously for about eight years and uses a proof-of-stake model that many users back. Reports also state that over 70% of ADA in circulation has been staked by holders who support the network. That figure is commonly cited when comparing Cardano’s staking take-up to other blockchains. Stablecoins are central to Hoskinson’s case. He told lawmakers and audiences that tokens tied to fiat could give people in countries with weak local currencies access to dollar-like stability. According to White House materials, the GENIUS Act has moved through the political process and was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, creating a new US framework for stablecoins. Based on data, the stablecoin market has topped $250 billion in supply, a milestone that regulators and banks are watching closely. Hoskinson was blunt about exchanges and the stock market. He called current exchange practices “preposterous” and criticized systems that rely on centralized trust, including large listing fees and gatekeeping by a few firms. He said decentralized exchanges — where the protocol enforces rules — could cut out those middlemen and give people more control over their assets. That pitch fits a wider industry argument for moving custody and trade settlement onto public blockchains. For Hoskinson, Bitcoin will stay digital gold, while stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems grow around it. The real question, he suggests, is not only how high Bitcoin’s price can go, but how the movement of money will be reshaped.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Second question: does the “supposed” Cartel de los Soles actually exist? Before we get to the meat of this article, which is really two articles in one, a quick recap (just in case some readers have been on a news-fast for the past three weeks). A few months ago, the US government designated the “SUPPOSED” (more on that later) “Cartel de los Soles” as a terrorist organisation, of which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is its alleged leader — alleged as in according to the US government. In early August, the Trump Administration offered a $50 million reward, up from $25 million, for information leading to the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, accusing Venezuela of being a “narco state.” Shortly thereafter, the US announced the deployment of a missile cruiser, a submarine, and three amphibious ships carrying 4,500 troops to the Caribbean, under the pretext of intercepting drug trafficking networks. There is no open talk of regime change though that is clearly the goal, as we noted in our post last Friday on the real reasons behind Washington’s latest show of force against Venezuela: Anyone who believes or supports this latest pretext for war against a country the US has tried to regime change at least twice so far this century and which has been subject to more than a decade of crippling US sanctions is either exceptionally gullible or an apologist for empire. The most important reason, of course, is oil. As the Mexican-Lebanese geopolitical analyst Alfredo Jalife says, Venezuela, once the “ranchito” of the Rockefeller family, is written with a capital “P” for “petroleo”. Indeed, even as Trump has ratcheted tensions with Venezuela, Chevron is still pumping out Venezuelan oil and shipping it back to the US. Other possible reasons include Venezuela’s close ties to China, Russia and Iran, the US’ three most important strategic rivals. As we noted in that post, the build-up of troops could also be part of a diversionary tactic as the Trump administration continues to reel from the Epstein scandal. This being Trump, it could also be just pure bluff or bluster. But it could also be the beginnings of something far more serious: another US-led military disaster. In recent days, the Venezuelan government has mobilised no fewer than four million army reservists to defend “la patria“. Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced plans to reinforce the country’s anti-narcotics efforts through the deployment of military vessels and 15,000 troops to patrol the country’s “territorial waters.” President Maduro said on Monday that all branches of Venezuela’s armed forces were prepared to defend the country. Thousands of civilians joined a voluntary militia enrolment drive in public squares over the past weekend. At the international level, Venezuela’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations called on member states to demand an end to the US’ “hostile actions”. Some countries in the region, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, have expressed alarm about the US’ deployment of so much naval hardware so close to Venezuelan waters. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. The 11 member nations of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA-TCP) unanimously condemned the US threat to regional stability. However, other governments in the region have sided with Washington and even offered up their land and waters for US troop movements. France Joins the Ruckus France has decided to join the ruckus by sending more ships to Guadeloupe, its overseas territory in the Caribbean. The Macron government claims its naval reinforcements are part of an international cooperation effort to regime change Venezuela against criminal networks in the area, and stressed the need to protect its overseas territories, in particular Guadeloupe and Martinique, which are often used as transit points for drug trafficking to Europe. The move comes, ironically, as fears of a French government collapse send its borrowing costs soaring. In fact, one thing that all three of Europe’s largest economies, Germany, the UK and France, have in common is their growing financial pains. Both France and the UK now have higher yields on their ten-year bonds than Spain and Greece, and their is even talk in both countries of the possible need for an IMF bailout. Meanwhile Germany’s Chancellor (and former BlackRock board member) Friedrich Merz has warned that Germany’s welfare state model is no longer sustainable. As Yves would say, quelle surprise! Something else that unites the three countries is their governments’ determination to expand their military spending, at US insistence, despite their rapidly deteriorating finances. While French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou plans to freeze welfare payments, reduce pensioners’ benefits and abolish two national holidays, the one area where spending will dramatically increase is the military. As the French government deplores the state of its finances at home, it is sending military vessels to the Caribbean to join the US’ latest act of imperial misadventure. Which invites the question: will other US client and vassal states in Europe and Latin America be doing the same in the coming days and weeks? Is the US trying to build a “coalition of the willing” against Venezuela, just as it did against Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya with such disastrous consequences? There are certainly moves in that direction. Trinidad and Tobago’s recently elected right-leaning government last week expressed its support for the US naval operation, noting that organized crime and drug trafficking pose a direct threat to the security of the entire Caribbean. Desperate to court favours in Washington, the government also offered up its waters and territory for US operations against Venezuela if Washington requests them — to defend neighbouring Guyana, of course. The Essequibo Border Dispute For its part, the Guyanese government has also called for the strengthening of cooperation against transnational organized crime and narco-terrorism, in direct reference to the criminal organisation Cartel of the Suns. The President of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, said last Saturday that his country is willing to take actions to defend its territory and sovereignty in the “new environment”. This is a reference to the escalating border dispute between Guyana (formerly British Guyana) and Venezuela over the Essequibo, a 160,000 square-kilometre oil-soaked territory that is on track to become Exxon Mobil’s largest single source of revenue by the end of this decade and which the US, unsurprisingly, would like to turn into a military outpost. For Guyana, the huge oil discoveries could end up being as much as curse as a blessing, as the NYT reported last year: The deal that made [Exxon’s success] ´possible — and which gave Exxon Mobil the bulk of the proceeds — has been a point of public outcry and even a lawsuit, with a seeming consensus that Guyana got the short end of the stick. But the deal has nonetheless generated $3.5 billion so far for the country, more money than it has ever seen, significantly more than it gained from conserving trees. It’s enough to chart a new destiny. But that new destiny has already included escalating tensions with its much larger neighbour, Venezuela, and risks turning Guyana into another disposable pawn in the furtherance of US geostrategic interests in its direct neighbourhood. As we warned in November 2023, this centuries-old dispute in an oil-rich corner of South America has the potential to become the next geopolitical flashpoint: Essequibo is not only rich in oil and gas; it boasts other mineral deposits, including Gold and Bauxite, as well as huge fish stocks and fresh water supplies, which a government minister even recently talked about exporting to other countries. As the Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), General Laura Richardson, said in January, Latin America is home to 31% of the world’s fresh water. But for the moment, it is Guyana’s vast untapped energy supplies that are of prime interest to US and global corporations. According to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, Guyana’s coastal area has roughly 13.6 billion barrels of oil reserves and 32 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves waiting to be drilled. For a country with one of the lowest population densities on the planet and a GDP of slightly less than $10 billion, a bonanza awaits. But Caracas contends that the untapped energy supplies belong to Venezuela and that the arbitration panel that granted Guyana jurisdiction over Essequibo was rigged. A Meagre Coalition So Far So far, four countries in the region have designated the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organisation: the United States, Ecuador, Paraguay and Argentina. My guess is that Peru will be next in line. Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, has already said that she has “not the slightest doubt” that Peru, like other countries in the region, will join this latest US-led charge against the Maduro government. However, as coalitions go, this one is pretty meagre. One country that is missing is Colombia, which has played a key role in previous regime change attempts, including Juan Guaidó’s risible coup attempt in 2019. However, since the election of left-leaning Gustavo Petro as president in 2022, Colombia has tried to replace its alignment with the US with multilateral relations, even going so far as to join the BRICS’ New Development Bank and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. When Petro took the reins as president, diplomatic ties between Colombia and Venezuela were essentially on hold. Since then relations have gradually been re-established. In recent months Petro has even proposed building a confederation of nations with neighbouring countries (Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama) based on the former Greater Colombia that existed between 1819 and 1931 and comprised the four aforementioned countries. It will be very interesting to see how Colombia responds to developments in Venezuela. A few days ago, Maduro announced the movement of 15,000 troops to Venezuela’s border with Colombia earlier this week. Then yesterday (Aug 28), Gustavo Petro announced the movement of 25,000 Colombian troops to the other side of that border, which has been greeted positively by the Maduro government. This border region has long been a focal point of violent clashes between government forces (on both sides), insurgency and paramilitary groups. Lest we forget, Colombia is trying to put behind it 52 years of civil war. However, political violence is once again rearing its ugly head. A few weeks ago, the opposition politician Miguel Uribe finally succumbed to the injuries he sustained in an assassination attempt in mid-June. In addition, a car bomb was recently set off next to a military base in Cali and a police helicopter downed in the town of Amalfi. In total, 19 people were killed and 65 injured in the two attacks. The car bomb explosion in Cali has been described by local media as the “worst terrorist attack” in the country since 2019, when ELN guerrillas staged a car bomb attack against the General Santander police school, in the south of Bogotá, leaving 21 dead. Both attacks were attributed to dissident factions of the now-extinct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. President Petro described what happened as “a day of death.” One can imagine Petro spending much of his time looking over his shoulder. Colombia is home to at least seven US military bases, and was until recently considered by many, including Hugo Chávez, as the Israel of Latin America. But Petro has tried to change that — first, by building alliances with other Global South countries, and second, by severing ties with Israel over its genocide in Gaza. In the process, he will have made lots of enemies, at home and abroad. In July, audio recordings were released in which Petro’s former Foreign Minister Álvaro Leyva could be heard talking about organising a coup against the Petro government. Israel is also stirring the pot, as the veteran journalist Gonzalo Guillén warned in a tweet yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s regime and the far right in general are promoting an irresponsible and fallacious narrative: that Hezbollah terrorism is hiding on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. This claim, besides being completely unsubstsantiated and absurd, clearly aims to ignite the region and destabilise both countries. This accusation is entirely baseless and has serious geopolitical implications. They seek to generate chaos, confrontation, and destruction. Does the Cartel de los Soles Actually Exist? This is a question NC reader Veronius asked in a comment to our previous post on Venezuela. According to Gustavo Petro, the answer is a definitive “no”. “It is the fictitious excuse used by the far right to overthrow governments that do not obey them,” Petro wrote on X earlier this week. In so doing, he opened up an intriguing can of worms. According to US government agencies, there is more than sufficient evidence tying senior Venezuelan army commanders and senior members of the Maduro government to drug trafficking. But not everyone agrees. Even the former Venezuelan presidential candidate Enrique Capriles, who is certainly no friend of the Maduro government, has said in an interview with CNN (see below) that the US government needs to back up its claims with evidence. We, Venezuelans, don’t know who is part of the Cartel de los Soles. I don’t have any information on that. I can’t provide it and I think the United States needs to present the evidence. Such a serious accusation requires putting the proof on the table. Who are the members of the Cartel de los Soles? Who runs it, where does it operate? But not just in rhetoric, show the evidence. La extrema derecha venezolana desplegó una campaña de acoso y derribo contra Henrique Capriles porque pide algo de sentido común: mostrar las pruebas de ese supuesto Cartel de los Soles, quiénes operan y dónde. "De una acusación tan grave, hay que poner las pruebas sobre la mesa" https://t.co/NzSUUezGiA — Karen Méndez (@Karenmendezl) August 29, 2025 If the Cartel de los Soles does indeed exist, one thing is clear: it is not nearly as big a player in the global drugs trade as the Trump administration is making out — and certainly not as big a player as the US government itself. As we noted in our previous post, the US is arguably the largest enabler of drug trafficking organisations on the planet: [This it does] while waging a Global War on Drugs, just as it has been arguably the largest supporter of Islamist terrorist organisations while waging a Global War on Terror. Both types of organisations have proven to be useful allies in the pursuance of US imperial ambitions (e.g. the Colombian and Mexican cartels during Nicaragua’s Contra insurgency in the 1980s, or the Al Qaeda offshoots in Syria) while also serving as handy pretexts for military intervention. It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, doing something the US military never could, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. pic.twitter.com/LcAFqA317a — MintPress News (@MintPressNews) August 7, 2023 According to the official narrative, shaped over the past decade by US government agencies and Western media, the Cartel de los Soles is a loose-knit network of Venezuelan generals and politicians that are involved in drug trafficking, in alliance with Colombian and Mexican cartels. The organisation came into existence some time in the ’90s when army officials began taking kickbacks from Colombian cartels. The name “Cartel of Suns” allegedly comes from the emblems that looked like suns on the generals’ uniforms. To date, the US has prosecuted two Venezuelan generals on charges related to drug trafficking. In the most recent case, Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former head of military intelligence in Venezuela during Hugo Chávez’s government, last month pled guilty to trafficking cocaine to the US in a narcoterrorism conspiracy. As the journalist Antonio Maria Delgado reported in the Miami Herald, Carvajal also claims to have evidence about Venezuela’s involvement with Iran and Colombia’s FARC, espionage within the US, and Maduro’s ties with the Tren de Aragua gang, which serves as a “paramilitary arm of the state” and which has also been designated by the US as a terrorist organisation. However, Delgado notes, “Carvajal has a history of shifting loyalties and politically motivated statements”. Of course, the idea of army generals taking kickbacks from drug trafficking organisations is totally believable. It happens all over the world. Whether in Mexico, Afghanistan, Myanmar or Colombia, wherever large volumes of drugs are being cultivated, processed, or distributed, rest assured that some (often senior) army officers are getting a cut of the action for looking the other way, or even for helping with the distribution. A perfect case in point: “Tim told me about basically a gang … a drug-trafficking organization within the military,” made up of “an unspoken group of soldiers that policed themselves.” Inside Fort Bragg's Secret Cartel and Unsolved Murders: https://t.co/ZSgmHIFaZN https://t.co/Fqfqg9RZbq pic.twitter.com/HsspVifLCv — Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) July 28, 2025 As Venezuela Analysis notes, reports from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) itself state that less than 10% of US-bound cocaine flowed through Venezuela and the Eastern Caribbean corridor: A 2020 document from the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) by Venezuelan government critics Geoff Ramsey and David Smilde concluded that the country “is not a primary transit country for US-bound cocaine” and that the bulk of drug shipments reach US territory via Washington-allied countries in Central America. In more recent years, Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine, with some reports suggesting that as much as 70% of the global cocaine supply passes through the country. Curiously, the Cartel de los Soles does not merit a single mention in the DEA’s National Drug Threat Assessment from last year. Nor is it mentioned in previous editions I’ve checked. Even in the 2025 edition, which was written under the Trump administration, “Cartel de los Soles” does not appear once. If the organisation is such a threat, why doesn’t it feature once in the DEA’s threat assessment? The European Drug Report 2025, based on real data and not on geopolitical interests, does not mention Venezuela once as an international drug trafficking route. Even more damning is an article by Pino Arlacci, the former Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime. Here is a brief excerpt, though the article is well worth reading in its entirety (if you don’t speak Spanish, use a machine translator): During my tenure as Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime, I was in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil, but I never visited Venezuela. There was simply no need. The Venezuelan government’s cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking was one of the best in South America; it can be compared only to Cuba’s impeccable record. This fact, in Trump’s delusional narrative of “Venezuela as a narco-state,” sounds like a geopolitically motivated slander. But the data, published in the 2025 World Drug Report of the organization I had the honor of leading, tell an opposite story to the one spread by the Trump administration. A story that dismantles piece by piece the geopolitical framework built around the “Cartel of the Suns”, an entity as legendary as the Loch Ness Monster, but apt to justify sanctions, embargoes and threats of military intervention against a country that, coincidentally, is located on one of the largest oil reserves on the planet… The “Cartel of the Suns” is a creation of Trump’s imagination. It is supposedly led by the president of Venezuela, but it is not mentioned in the report of the world’s main anti-drug agency, nor in the documents of any European agency or almost any other anti-crime agency in the world. Not even a footnote. A deafening silence, which should make anyone who even has a minimum of critical thinking reflect. How can such a powerful criminal organization, deserving of a $50 million bounty, be completely ignored by those working in the anti-drug field?… While Washington is stirring up the issue of Venezuela, the real centers of drug trafficking prosper almost undisturbed. In Ecuador, for example, 57% of the containers of bananas that leave Guayaquil arrive in Belgium loaded with cocaine. European authorities seized 13 tons of cocaine from a Spanish ship coming from Ecuadorian ports, controlled by companies protected by Ecuadorian government officials. The European Union produced a detailed report on the ports of Guayaquil, which describes how “Colombian, Mexican and Albanian mafias operate extensively in Ecuador.” The homicide rate in this country has skyrocketed from 7.8 per 100 thousand inhabitants in 2020 to 45.7 in 2023. But little is said about it. Perhaps because Ecuador produces only 0.5% of the world’s oil and because its government does not have a bad habit of challenging US dominance in Latin America? Lastly, something else that caught my eye during my research for this article was Wikipedia’s Spanish-language page on the Cartel de los Soles. On Google Search, the blurb below the title, which should match the first line or two of text on the corresponding Wikipedia page, reads as follows, or at least did so yesterday (translation and emphasis my own): The Cartel de los Soles is a supposed criminal and terrorist organisation led, according to the President of the United States, by senior military officers… In other words, even Wikipedia was still expressing doubts about its existence until a couple of days ago, and the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by Venezuelan senior military officers is sourced directly from the US government. However, if you click on the link, here’s what you now see: Translation (emphasis my own): The Cartel of the Suns is an illicit, criminal, and terrorist organization headed by high-ranking members of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces since the 1990s, according to some media outlets,[1] whose objective is primarily cocaine trafficking,[2] fuel smuggling,[3][4] control of illegal mining activity in several states of Venezuela, with direct participation in the extraction and smuggling of gold, coltan, precious stones and other minerals. [5] In other words, not only has the qualifier “supposed” been edited out of the text, expelling all doubt from readers’ minds, but also the reference to the president of the United States as the primary source for the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by senior military commanders of Venezuela’s armed forces. In its place as the new source for this information is “some media outlets”. And just like that, with a couple of minor tweaks to the text, all doubt is removed from the reader’s unsuspecting mind. And that, it seems, is one way that consent for US military operations is manufactured in today’s digital world. ‘The coalition of the willing’ is to normalize the militarism of the west (just as ‘weaponize’ is lazy semantics for propaganda). There is not ‘coalition of the willing’, there is only a groups of far right militarist western governments that seek global domination. There is no ‘willing’ population for these wars (if there were, then where are the lines for military recruitment?) . Do not join in the marketing jingoism of the imperialists do attack them, it is important to deconstruct their language, to show that not only their arguments but the foundations of its construct are erroneous You raise a fair point, haradan, and it is one that I will certainly keep in mind for the future. Unfortunately, because the expression in question is in the title of the post, it’s too late to change it. There maybe is not a coalition of the willing population, but there sure is a coalition of the willing governments. They are willing, and eager, though maybe lacking on the ‘able’. Has the CIA been messing with Wikipedia again? Nostalgia fans will remember when Reagan claimed he supported the Contras to keep Nicaragua from attacking our southern border. Before that Adolf kicked off WW2 in response to Polish aggression. As Jean Renoir says in Rules of the Game, “everybody has their reasons.” Still if regime change in Venezuela is in the cards who will do the invading? Unlike Kissinger’s Chile coup the army there seems to be on Maduro’s side. Perhaps it’s all simply a plan to give General Laura and her minions something to do. In a recent Nima talk Richard Wolff suggests that ever since the Great Depression the US economy has run on military Keynsianism. Are Macron and the Euros out to do the same? Somebody hold him back. Perhaps the whole point of this operation was a sort of litmus test while Trump is trying to make himself appear tough in front of his base. It is to gauge how much support there would be for a future move on Venezuela. Thing is, by the time one is organized France may be under IMF restrictions so could not help out much. Some of those US allies/vassals in South America may want to help but Venezuela has a lot of people running around with guns and you would not want to be a foreign force stuck in that country. The US has the missiles to hit Venezuela but not the troops to occupy the country. So perhaps it was also a test of how many people in Venezuela would support a colour revolution. Not a lot by the look of it. If Trump was smart he could make a deal with Venezuela for good terms in buying their oil and boast of it but I do not think that the neocons like Rubio will let him. But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump. “But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump.” Thanks for that, Rev. Isn’t the US government sufficiently preoccupied with a very large war and a genocide already? (Not to mention the ever-dreamt about war against China). They also got the boot from the Red Sea by the Yemenis. Why should anyone expect more success against Venezuela? Real empire collapse times going on. If they do in fact try this outlandish idea, I wonder how the public will like seeing US troops returning in coffins, as during Vietnam times. Will the government double down and start a war with Mexico in order to distract from a Venezuelan debacle? At that rate, it’ll eventually have to be at war against the entire planet. The US will not be sending 4,000 troops into battle in Venezuela. It would be a massacre. As mentioned in my previous post, if this does kick off (still a reasonably large “IF”), the US will be waging hybrid warfare against Venezuela (cyberattacks, attacks on infrastructure, maybe even drone and missile attacks like in Iran) while hoping the locals do all the heavy lifting. The only ones occupying body bags and coffins, I imagine, will be Venezuelans and other South Americans. You’re probably right on that count (since time immemorial the ones to pay the price of the Monroe Doctrine have been the South and Central Americans, not US citizens); but given the tremendously self-destructive activity the US has been engaging on (the tariffs being the most egregious example), I’ve become quite unsure about US rationality. Maybe a waning power could be delusional enough to think a few thousand troops would somehow collapse the government. And yeah, if they do try it’s going to make the Bay of Pigs look good. Just spitballing here off of Nick’s comment above, but maybe the force that will fight the Venezuelans is meant to come from Colombia. It seems very odd to me that Colombia would amass military forces on the border with Venezuela and this would be described as a “show of support”. It also could be labeled as a possible invasion force. It’s also extremely odd that the president of Colombia would send a large number of troops to that border when it is currently being heavily attacked by FARC dissidents in the last couple of weeks. How would the military feel about having been attacked in country by their own drug cartels, that they are now being sent as defenders of Venezuela, which is accused of supporting drug cartels? (Not that I believe this propaganda at all, but of course some of the military in Colombia might.) How good is Petro’s relationship with his own military? The military was previously fighting the FARC, but under Petro the fight was dropped. The military must not be happy with this. Further spitballing, you say that Guyana used to be a British colony. British intelligence is famous for highly deceptive plots. That’s also throw in Israeli intelligence given their meddling in this affair, and we’ve also got the French on side. This plot could not only be seen as a way to attack Venezuela, but also as a way to destabilize Colombia and bring a military coup there. Now obviously these are just fever dreams I’m having, but I wanted to share them anyway, just in case others may contribute more info. As an aside, I am currently in Bogota again for the next week. Things seem peaceful and normal here from what I see in my very safe neighborhood. I will ask my host about this issue, he seems pretty well informed generally. saludos I was wondering if China’s investments in Venezuela have included some shore based anti-ship missiles? Wouldn’t surprise me. Russia’s definitely helping Venezuela to manufacture munitions. Iran has been helping them develop drones for over a decade. Mauro Marcano, a journalist, was murdered for shedding light over the “Cartel de los soles” already back in 2004. Courts later sided with the drug lord who arranged his murder. https://rsf.org/en/victory-impunity-court-acquits-alleged-drug-baron-journalists-murder It is a shame that over 20 year later there still seem to be doubts about the Cartel’s existence. I think the point is that while there are certainly people in high places taking kickbacks from actual drug lords, this may not constitute a “cartel” by the normal definition of the word. I did check the link and I’m not all that familiar with Reporters Without Borders, but a glance at the home page indicates that they coincidentally have a lot of beefs with the very countries the US would like to regime change. Anybody else know more about this group? Another compromised NGO? Just because something existed 20 years ago does not mean it exists now. Given the US’ repeatedly proven propensity just to lie when it wants to and inability to provide evidence, my money is on it not existing; otherwise t would be splashed all over network news by now. FWIW, I’m currently reading Provoked by Scott Horton. While he clearly has an agenda, his references appear to be incredibly comprehensive. The book documents the absolutely vomit-inducing hypocrisy and mendacity of Washington over decades of war mongering, regime change, and war crimes. A distinctive element of the 2025 World Drug Report is its minimal mention of Venezuela, stating only a marginal fraction of Colombian drug production passes through the country to the Caribbean, US and Europe. The report from the highest global institution coordinating government drug policies makes no mention of the so-called Cartel of the Suns, which allegedly operates from Venezuela. For comparison, the European Drug Report 2025: Trends and Progress, published by the European Union, mentions no role for Venezuela as an international drug trafficking corridor. Though the European report states cocaine is the second most used drug in the EU’s 27 countries, Venezuela is unmentioned. Significant references appear for Colombia and Ecuador. https://orinocotribune.com/un-and-eu-confirm-venezuela-far-from-being-a-narco-country/ Well, the acquitted defendant, Garcia, was extradited from Trinidad to Venezuela and charged by the Venezuelan government. The murdered man had accused him of being the “head” of a cartel by that name, but I don’t see where he provided any evidence. In any case, Garcia seems to have had no government connections and the fact that he fled to Trinidad and was extradited suggests that he had no expectation of impunity. The cartel in this case, if it existed, would seem to have been a localised one, sharing nothing but maybe a name with the massive spectre supposedly headed by Maduro The global saber-rattling will ensure that more of all countries’ budgets go to military and surveillance spending rather than other needs for the people of various states. Everywhere one turns, there are military maneuvers. That is considered a win for those with infected with rabid neoliberal economic ideology. In addition to profits for the prison/detention industrial complex and redefining immigration statuses, the border lock-down frenzy is also happening in anticipation more conflict causing destabilization in all parts of the world. What’s more frightening than the usual strategy of “let’s find a country we can rape and steal its oil” is that the deep state and all the other nut-case neocons are thinking again in Zbigniew Brzezinski “Big Picture” terms, as “we may have to give up on the Eastern Hemishpere, so let’s really double down on controlling the other half of the planet.” Kind of like a new Monroe Doctrine. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. I don’t understand why these countries can’t simply exchange oil for equipment and goods. Wouldn’t that allow them to bypass USA sanctions? Am I missing something? This kind of trade has been common for centuries.” Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: TSMC Stock: Wall Street’s Most Overlooked AI Play?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/tsmc-stock-wall-streets-most-overlooked-ai-play/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T10:00:51Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has emerged as a notable beneficiary of the AI revolution. While TSMC serves as the backbone of the globe’s most sophisticated chip manufacturing supply chain, its stock has only risen about 18% year-to-date – significantly lower than U.S.-based chip companies like AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD), which is up 38%, Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) which has seen a 31% increase, and the struggling Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has achieved a gain of nearly 20%. This relative underperformance becomes even more pronounced when considering the company’s robust growth outlook, increasing profit margins, and a valuation that is more attractive than that of most competitors. TSMC’s facilities are not merely production plants; they rank among the most strategically vital assets on Earth, producing the processors that power iPhones, electric vehicles, AI data centers, and nearly every cutting-edge device, allowing investors to actually hold a share of them. At current multiples, this segment of global infrastructure doesn’t appear excessively priced, either. The investment rationale for TSMC is grounded in its prominent position in advanced chip manufacturing. As the largest semiconductor foundry globally, it produces a significant portion of the world's most advanced chips. In Q2 2025, revenues surged 44% year-over-year to $30.07 billion, with high-performance computing accounting for 60% of the sales composition and smartphone chips contributing another 27%. In total, TSMC produces about two-thirds of the world’s semiconductors – and an even larger share of AI-optimized chips. This dominance stems from the company's leadership in advanced process technology. TSMC already commands the 3nm and 5nm nodes and is advancing into the 2nm "gate-all-around" technology this year, solidifying its leadership position. Advanced nodes (3nm, 5nm, 7nm) represent nearly 74% of TSMC’s production. In the AI sector, its standing is even more formidable. TSMC’s 3nm and upcoming 2nm nodes, together with cutting-edge packaging technologies crucial for AI accelerators, provide a technological advantage that competitors cannot replicate. Its enormous scale and unparalleled reliability have established it as the go-to provider for all significant AI chip manufacturers – from Nvidia and AMD to hyperscalers that design custom silicon. While companies like Intel have made strides toward more advanced nodes like the 18A process, they are usually far behind TSMC regarding yield rates and efficiency. The 2nm Race: Intel’s 18A Faces Uphill Task Against TSMC The growth prospects appear even more appealing. TSMC anticipates overall revenue growth of 30% in 2025, while its AI-centric business alone is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 40% in the foreseeable future, starting from its 2024 base. Industry projections estimate AI infrastructure spending to reach $6.7 trillion by 2030. With TSMC supplying the advanced chips that drive AI systems, the company has a lengthy growth trajectory ahead. Additionally, there are favorable policies at play. TSMC has received a reprieve from President Trump’s 100% chip tariffs as it has been expanding its operations in the U.S. New fabrication plants in the U.S. and Japan are also intended to reduce the geopolitical concentration risks associated with Taiwan. The company’s balance sheet is equally robust, featuring $86 billion in cash and marketable securities against approximately $29 billion in long-term debt. The margins further highlight the strength of the company’s business model. Gross margins hover around 59%, while operating margins climbed to nearly 50% in the last quarter – reflecting a solid 700 basis points increase from a year prior. This illustrates pricing power, efficiency, and its ability to outperform competitors like Intel and Samsung, who continue to face challenges with transitioning to next-generation nodes. Nonetheless, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 24x, TSMC appears significantly less expensive than most U.S. chip design companies, especially given its unparalleled technology, scale, and structural exposure to AI. Given its strong growth, resilient margins, and a valuation that hasn’t yet aligned with its peers, TSMC could be one of the most overlooked opportunities to capitalize on the AI chip surge. It’s important to note, however, that no investment story is devoid of risks. The most apparent overhang is geopolitical: tensions between China and Taiwan cast a substantial shadow over TSMC’s global dominance. While overseas fabs alleviate concentration concerns, they also tend to increase costs. Another potential risk is disappointment in growth outside of AI. Apple, which stands as one of TSMC's largest clients, has encountered sluggish demand in recent quarters, and broader consumer electronics spending might impact non-AI segments adversely. The rising requirements for capital expenditure could also put pressure on free cash flow, even if margins remain strong. While TSMC stock may seem risky, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? As a collective, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they have provided a smoother investment experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Netflix Stock Worth The Risk At $1,200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/netflix-stock-worth-the-risk-at-1200/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ: NFLX) has experienced significant growth, increasing by approximately 35% this year and over 70% in the last twelve months. The stock is now priced at over $1,200. This substantial rise follows two strategic decisions made by Netflix after the pandemic: enforcing restrictions on password sharing and introducing a more affordable, ad-supported tier. Both strategies have proven effective, enhancing subscriber numbers and providing a considerable revenue boost, with Q2 sales increasing by 16% compared to the previous year. Clearly, things have been going well. However, here lies the issue – these strategies are now being utilized in most markets, content expenses are rising, competitors are active, and the stock is currently valued for absolute success. When performance is so strong, it can be tempting for investors to assume that this momentum will continue indefinitely. This is precisely when potential risks are often overlooked. In 2024 alone, Netflix added more than 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber total to nearly 302 million, marking the largest annual growth in its history. The crackdown on password-sharing has encouraged users to either pay additional fees for extra access or enroll independently. Moreover, the ad-supported tier, which offers a more budget-friendly entry option, has experienced robust uptake, with more than half of new subscribers in eligible markets opting for this plan in the latest quarter. These changes have opened up new revenue avenues and reignited growth after a plateau following the pandemic. Nevertheless, there are growing concerns regarding future developments. With both strategies already in place in significant markets, maintaining the same rate of subscriber growth could be challenging. Additionally, Netflix has declared that it will cease reporting subscriber figures starting in 2025, signaling expectations for slower growth going forward. The competition is intensifying once again. Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+ are reinforcing their focus on content and bundling initiatives. While Netflix’s extensive content library and scale still provide it an advantage, competitors are capitalizing on unique strengths. For example, Disney packages Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ together for as low as $17 per month, making the service more engaging and reducing subscriber turnover. Importantly, Disney can justify its substantial streaming investments because it profits from its intellectual property across parks, merchandise, and film releases. See How Disney Stock Can Surge To $230 Despite the surge in subscriber numbers, concerns regarding pricing, expenses, and broader economic conditions persist. Netflix has continuously raised subscription rates. Its premium plan now costs $25 per month, while the standard HD plan has increased by $2.50 to $18. While price increases may enhance margins in the short term, they also pose a risk of alienating cost-conscious users, particularly amid higher inflation and tariffs which could impact disposable income. Content costs represent another hurdle. Netflix has ventured into live sports broadcasting, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which come with higher production and licensing expenses. Although margins improved in Q2, management has warned that operating margins could decline in the latter half of 2025 due to increased amortization and marketing expenses linked to its new offerings. Netflix is projected to spend over $20 billion yearly on content by 2026, an increase from approximately $17 billion in 2024. At its current valuation, Netflix trades at roughly 47 times the consensus earnings for 2025, compared to about 20 times in mid-2022. This premium valuation presumes that the company can maintain double-digit growth and margin expansion in the long term. However, consensus forecasts indicate revenue growth of only 15% to 13% for 2025 and 2026, which falls short of its historical growth rate. With increasing costs, slowing subscriber additions, and rising competition, Netflix may struggle to substantiate its current valuation. In contrast, Disney stock trades at approximately 20 times forward earnings with a market cap of $200 billion, while its direct-to-consumer segments generated $24.15 billion in revenue over the past 12 months compared to Netflix’s $41 billion. This suggests that Disney’s valuation may be underestimated given its strengths in streaming and highlights why Netflix’s inflated stock price might face downward pressure if growth slows. Worried about Netflix stock’s high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a strong history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?In aggregate, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a more stable investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Crypto ETF market expands with 92 filings awaiting SEC decision

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now faces one of its heaviest backlogs in the digital asset space, with at least 92 cryptocurrency exchange-traded product applications awaiting review. According to an expert, Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) lead the wave of filings, each with multiple applications under consideration. The trend highlights growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure through regulated investment vehicles, even as the SEC continues to weigh its stance on crypto products. The pace of new filings has accelerated in recent months, suggesting the market is preparing for a broader expansion of crypto ETFs. Solana and XRP have emerged as the frontrunners among altcoins in ETF interest. Analyst James Seyffart reported that Solana currently has eight ETF applications pending, while XRP has seven. Both tokens rank among the most actively pursued crypto assets after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on April 21 that 72 crypto-related ETFs were already awaiting SEC review at that time. With the figure now at 92, a further 20 applications have been added in just four months, pointing to rising momentum across the industry. The filings include proposals offering exposure not only to Solana and XRP but also to other altcoins, alongside three ETFs linked to Bitcoin and Ether. Two of the largest players in the digital asset space, Grayscale and 21Shares, are also part of the current SEC queue. Both are seeking approval for Ether staking ETFs. Earlier this month, the SEC clarified that some liquid staking activities fall outside its regulatory scope, a development that may impact how such filings are assessed. Grayscale is also pursuing a major conversion of five of its existing trusts into ETFs. These include three publicly traded funds and two private trusts, covering exposure to Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. Such conversions would expand ETF access across a broader set of cryptocurrencies if approved. The potential impact of SEC decisions on altcoin markets remains a key focus for traders. Analysts at Bitfinex observed on Monday that a broader rally among altcoins is unlikely until more crypto ETFs gain approval. This view underscores the role regulatory clarity could play in shaping institutional and retail participation in the sector. Meanwhile, market commentators such as NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci have pointed to the sheer volume of filings as evidence of what they call “crypto ETF floodgates about to open soon”. While new applications continue to pile up, global asset manager BlackRock has already secured a commanding lead in the crypto ETF category. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has attracted net inflows of $58.28 billion since launch. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has accumulated $13.12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. A Wednesday report also indicated that ETHA may soon surpass Coinbase as the largest single holder of Ether. Notably, IBIT now generates more annual fee revenue for BlackRock than its flagship S&P fund, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). This is due to the fee structure, with IBIT carrying an expense ratio of 0.25%, compared to just 0.03% for IVV.

We're watching the systematic dismantling of human imagination, and we need to think about how to respond. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As a journalist, I've had a lot of press releases and other communications lately about how AI is "democratising creativity". And I won't lie, I can see the logic in that. Most of us have found that tools ranging from ChatGPT to Adobe Firefly Boards have helped us out in some way or other (see here how AI is impacting graphic design). But there's a very big flipside to all of this. Let's not forget that, right now, the creative industries are having their guts ripped out by artificial intelligence. And the worst part? We're all just standing around watching it happen. To take just one example, WPP – yes, that WPP, the advertising behemoth that once symbolised British creative dominance – recently axed 7,000 jobs. Seven thousand. That's not downsizing; that's a creative apocalypse. But is this wise? To my mind, the advertising industry has always been built on a fundamental truth: humans buy from humans. We respond to stories, emotions, and that indefinable spark of creativity that makes us stop scrolling. And that can't be faked (as Will Smith just found out). Remember one of the best ads ever, that Cadbury gorilla drumming to Phil Collins? Pure human madness that somehow worked perfectly. Try explaining that brief to an algorithm. Yet here we are, reading Meta's Mark Zuckerberg promise in July that businesses won't need "any creative, any targeting, any measurement" because the AI software Meta is developing will handle everything. This isn't just happening in the advertising world, either. The tech industry has shed over 22,000 jobs in 2025, with a shocking 16,084 layoffs in February alone. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta have all been slicing through workforces whilst simultaneously investing billions in the AI tech making jobs obsolete. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Meanwhile, the IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality. Anecdotally, most freelancers have seen demand drop due to AI, including myself. Which is not surprising when illustrators, copywriters, designers and others, who've spent years honing their craft, are being told their skills are now available in a software package for $20 a month. Already dealing with late payments and low fees, freelancers now face competing with algorithms that don't need sleep, don't demand payment, and definitely don't complain about unreasonable deadlines. Tech companies love to frame this carnage as "democratisation." I think a better word, though, might be "homogenisation". When everyone has access to the same AI tools, trained on the same datasets, we don't get diversity – we get a creative monoculture. Yes AI can churn out perfectly adequate content at lightning speed. But in the process, it's creating a tsunami of forgettable mediocrity. Indeed, every time I look at Facebook ads these days, I feel like I'm drowning in AI-generated imagery that looks like it was designed by committee in a parallel universe where humans have never experienced joy; glossy, idealised, and slightly plasticky looking. So what do we do? Well, perhaps we stop pretending this is inevitable. After all, every AI implementation is a choice, every job cut is a decision. We can choose differently. Should creatives start to get militant? The Hollywood writers' strike showed that organised resistance works; they secured protections against AI replacement. Maybe artists, illustrators, designers, photographers and others need to fight to similar safeguards... before there's nothing left to protect. Because make no mistake: 2025 will be remembered as the year creativity went to war with artificial intelligence – and lost the first battle. We're not just losing jobs. We're losing the messy, unpredictable, gloriously human process of creation itself. Unless we act now, we'll be living in a world where creativity is just another task for machines to optimise.

The second-largest crypto is up more than 17% over the past 30 days compared to Bitcoin’s negative return of 5.5%, CoinGecko data shows. It follows a record setting run earlier this week, where Ethereum climbed to $4,945, its highest ever price, on Sunday. “Ethereum offers a dynamic growth story,” Xu Han, director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, told Decrypt. He pointed to deflationary tokenomics post-Merge, scalability via Layer-2 adoption, and a yield-bearing staking model. On the last point, the amount of Ethereum that has been deployed for staking activity has continued to rise this year, reaching a record 35,750 ETH, or roughly $169 million, on August 2, according to data analytics platform Beaconchain. While that figure has effectively plateaued in recent weeks, structural advantages, combined with its role as the foundational layer for DeFi and tokenization, continue to attract institutional inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds, Han said. As of August, no U.S. Ethereum staking ETFs have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though some, including digital asset manager BlackRock, are hopeful that could soon change. Still, the attention remains fixed on the spot-based products, where Ethereum ETFs have staged a comeback after weathering outflows totaling $237.7 million from August 15 through to August 20. As of this week, Ethereum ETFs have garnered over $1.2 billion in inflows through Thursday, according to data from SoSoValue. Elsewhere in the market, Solana has begun to outpace its peers with a 7% gain noted since mid-August, coinciding with a 31% surge in Solana’s DEX volume to $5.10 billion over the past week, per DeFiLlama. Though it faces its own troubles with retail traders on Solana-based decentralized exchanges having pivoted away from speculative meme coin trading, leading to a crunch in the daily DEX trader count.

Title: Letters: Why divided Labour Party should pull a Rabbitte out of the hat in race for Áras

Full Content:
Former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte could be just the solution for party members to resolve differences concerning presidential election nomination One might think a small party like Labour could pull together. However, former leader Alan Kelly has caused quite a stir by saying he is opposed to its endorsement of Independent TD Catherine Connolly as a presidential election candidate. Mr Kelly has proved himself by surviving in the cockpit of North Tipperary in the last few elections. He is still well thought of in political circles, so his opposition is a blow to the party and leader Ivana Bacik. I may have a solution for Labour. Why not pull “a Rabbitte” out of the hat? The Labour Party should go cap in hand to Pat, another former leader, and beg him to be its candidate. I have always said he is the only credible Labour candidate for this election. He comes from the west of Ireland and has represented Dublin for many years and still has a profile. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo An Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed 20 people, mostly journal­ists and medics (‘Israel claims ‘double-tap’ strike on hospital that killed 20, including five journalists, targeted Hamas camera’, Irish Independent, August 26), has been justified by Israel because of a “surveillance camera”. Really? A camera? People who are starving, with little drinking water, no medicine and no hope of any shipments due to the Israeli control of aid and access are able to get high-tech equipment somehow and then decide to install it in their hospitals? Israel is so used to getting away with excuses that lack truth that it will tell the media just about anything. We could ask why it had to bomb the camera when there were journal­ists and medics responding to the first bomb. Why not take out the camera at 3am to minimise civilian casualties? Tom Harper, Blackrock, Co Dublin Israel continues its massacres in Gaza; Russia continues the slaughter in Ukraine. The international comm­unity and the UN have failed. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize. Solution: President Trump stops all US support for Israel and maximises US support for Ukraine. The wars end. President Trump wins the Nobel Prize. The global economy improves. US businesses thrive. This makes America great again. Chris Fitzpatrick, Dublin 6 The recent meeting of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders seems to have left us with more questions than answers. Trump indicated broadly that America would support the security of Ukraine. However, no specifics were given, as is the case with many of Trump’s statements. Apparently, land exchanges were part of the private discussions between the leaders. At this crucial juncture, it would be more beneficial for Ukraine to exchange land with the US as a pay-off for security now and into the future. After all, Trump is a transactional president, and it would also be in ­Europe’s interest in the longer term. Talks of bilateral and trilateral meetings, and the protracted nature of these, could well expose us to the volatile side of Trump and leave Ukraine totally exposed. Denis O Keeffe, Lisnagry, Co Limerick At a demonstration outside the Irish Central Bank this week, Dr Bridget Kiely called on Irish people to seek options to drugs made by Israeli firms (‘Hundreds rally against Central Bank role in Israeli “war bonds”’, Irish independent, August 27). The most famous of the Israeli drug firms is Teva. It has two facilities in Ireland that employ 650 highly skilled people. Its output is supplied to the HSE and also exported to 30 countries. Why should Irish jobs be put in jeopardy when, to end the war in Gaza, Hamas has only to release its Israeli hostages, disarm and disband? Karl Martin, Dublin 13 The Pope should go to Gaza. Until now, his approach has been entirely vocal and diplomatic – his actions have been limited to public statements, telegrams and high-level phone calls. The world’s collective conscience has finally awoken and public opinion has undergone a seismic shift, with people publicly demonstrating their horror and revulsion at the genocide in Gaza. A population is being annihilated, and this is why Pope Leo should go to Gaza. The Pope is in a unique position, invested with a universally recognised moral authority. Now is the time to eschew diplomacy for moral leadership. Action, not rhetoric, will honour Christ’s example. Eileen Seery, Gorey, Co Wexford It was heartbreaking to learn that on Wednesday, two children aged eight and 10 were killed and 17 other people were injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. I get so angry when I hear how easy it is to obtain a gun in the US. In America, gun ownership is a widespread and complex issue, with a diverse range of perspectives. About 77 million adults own guns there, with self-protection being the main reason for having them. However, views on gun control and the role of firearms in society vary widely, even within different groups of gun owners. It’s when one hears of a tragedy, such as the one in Minneapolis, that one would hope the powers that be in the US might consider banning ownership of guns. If the American authorities ignore such a call, we will be hearing about more of these awful tragedies. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary With regard to the Leaving Cert, I read somewhere that 70pc of pupils negotiate maths very well. Alas, I am with the remaining 40pc.

Even if his dream of reunification was never fully realised, Éamon de Valera’s tireless aspirations made him a hero in so many Irish people’s eyes Éamon de Valera in 1932 when he was minister for external affairs. Photo: Getty In the Ireland into which I was born in the early 1940s, nobody loomed larger than our taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, who died on this day 50 years ago. He was widely revered as a national saviour, but also distrusted – even hated – by many others. His merits, or lack thereof, were endlessly debated. My mother admired him, my father did not.

Despite past hype around value-unlocking announcements, the 2024 meeting too failed to impress. Ahead of today’s AGM, expectations are muted, with brokerages suggesting this could finally leave room for a positive surprise if Mukesh Ambani delivers on growth cues across Jio, Retail, and New Energy.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Sustain the AI Stock Rally—Just Without Nvidia

Time Published: 2025-08-28T23:15:37Z
Full Content:
Nvidia's earnings were great for AI stocks, just not Nvidia’s. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” wrote UBS analysts of Nvidia’s earnings in a note on Thursday. That was evident on Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, with some of the market’s favorite AI stocks among the strong performers, including Micron (MU), GE Vernova (GEV), Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO), and nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG). Major cloud providers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Oracle (ORCL) all rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell nearly 1% after the AI chip giant reported earnings that beat estimates. The disconnect between Nvidia and the rest of the AI trade may boil down to expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. "For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential," wrote Moore in a note on Thursday morning. "But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter," he added. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has been the driving force behind much of the stock market’s gains over the past three years. Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon and Meta (META) have seen their sales, stocks and spending on AI infrastructure soar amid surging demand for AI products and services. But the rally has repeatedly hit bumps in the road, as it did last week when jitters about an AI bubble cropped up after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman questioned the AI rally’s sustainability and an MIT study found the vast majority of companies have seen no material return on their AI investments. Nvidia’s report on Wednesday, though, painted a picture of robust and growing AI demand. The company forecast sales would total about $54 billion in the third quarter, a more than $7 billion increase from Q2. That growth rate of about 15%—robust on a year-over-year basis, let alone quarter-over-quarter—doesn’t include any sales to China, which once accounted for about 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, according to Moore. Based on management’s commentary and Morgan Stanley’s market research, Nvidia’s growth forecast “represent[s] undershipment of true demand,” said Moore. He pointed to strong sales of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, launched in 2022 and superseded by the Blackwell system last year, as evidence of unmet demand. “Compute shortages remain intense enough customers are still buying three year old Hoppers to serve some of that demand,” Moore said. There was additional evidence of strong AI demand in cloud data software provider Snowflake’s better-than-expected quarterly report on Wednesday. The results were driven by “strength in migrations,” according to Citi analysts, suggesting “large enterprises' increasing budget allocation towards database modernization as part of AI projects.” UBS analysts pointed to several other reasons, aside from AI hype, to be optimistic about the prospects for technology stocks this year. "Second-quarter earnings for big tech have been robust and broad-based, with most companies beating both sales and EPS estimates," the analysts wrote. They expect tech earnings to grow 15% this year, and hold in the low teens next year. Earnings should be boosted in the near term by U.S. dollar weakness. The U.S. dollar index has fallen about 10% since the start of the year, a decline that, by UBS estimates, should translate to a roughly 2.5% increase in the S&P 500's earnings. "We see more room for the US dollar to decline from current levels, with the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle set to kick off next month." High stock valuations have been a recurring source of anxiety for tech investors throughout the AI rally.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Sustain the AI Stock Rally—Just Without Nvidia

Nvidia's earnings were great for AI stocks, just not Nvidia’s. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” wrote UBS analysts of Nvidia’s earnings in a note on Thursday. That was evident on Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, with some of the market’s favorite AI stocks among the strong performers, including Micron (MU), GE Vernova (GEV), Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO), and nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG). Major cloud providers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Oracle (ORCL) all rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell nearly 1% after the AI chip giant reported earnings that beat estimates. The disconnect between Nvidia and the rest of the AI trade may boil down to expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. "For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential," wrote Moore in a note on Thursday morning. "But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter," he added. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has been the driving force behind much of the stock market’s gains over the past three years. Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon and Meta (META) have seen their sales, stocks and spending on AI infrastructure soar amid surging demand for AI products and services. But the rally has repeatedly hit bumps in the road, as it did last week when jitters about an AI bubble cropped up after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman questioned the AI rally’s sustainability and an MIT study found the vast majority of companies have seen no material return on their AI investments. Nvidia’s report on Wednesday, though, painted a picture of robust and growing AI demand. The company forecast sales would total about $54 billion in the third quarter, a more than $7 billion increase from Q2. That growth rate of about 15%—robust on a year-over-year basis, let alone quarter-over-quarter—doesn’t include any sales to China, which once accounted for about 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, according to Moore. Based on management’s commentary and Morgan Stanley’s market research, Nvidia’s growth forecast “represent[s] undershipment of true demand,” said Moore. He pointed to strong sales of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, launched in 2022 and superseded by the Blackwell system last year, as evidence of unmet demand. “Compute shortages remain intense enough customers are still buying three year old Hoppers to serve some of that demand,” Moore said. There was additional evidence of strong AI demand in cloud data software provider Snowflake’s better-than-expected quarterly report on Wednesday.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Major U.S. equities indexes rose as investors digested quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA), the world's highest valued company, and a report showing a positive revision to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% on Thursday, securing a second straight all-time closing high and finishing a day above 6500 for the first time. The Dow gained 0.2%, joining the broader benchmark index in record closing territory, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%, closing just below its record level. Nvidia, for its part, fell less than 1%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Datadog (DDOG) shares logged the S&P 500's top daily performance, jumping 7%. Thursday's surge for Datadog stock added to gains posted in the previous session following a strong earnings report from fellow database software specialist MongoDB (MDB). Datadog has launched several new products this year that leverage artificial intelligence technology to enhance its platform's database-monitoring capabilities, helping revenue growth. Shares of Fair Isaac (FICO), the data analytics company known for its consumer credit scores, advanced 6.1%. The stock has come under pressure in recent months following criticism of its pricing scheme by William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who announced in July that mortgage lenders would be able to use FICO competitor VantageScore to evaluate the credit of potential borrowers. Some analysts have lately grown more positive on the shares, citing among other reasons its pricing strength for credit evaluations. Agilent Technologies (A) surpassed sales and profit expectations for its fiscal third quarter, and shares of the health sciences company gained 5.3%. The company also issued stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter, highlighting strong demand in its pharmaceutical end markets and its chemicals and advanced materials segment. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares plummeted 13%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. The maker of deli meats and parent company of brands including Spam and Skippy reported mixed results for its fiscal third quarter, topping revenue estimates but falling short of adjusted profit expectations. The company attributed its lackluster performance to increases in commodity input costs. Hormel expects this trend to continue in the current quarter and said it plans pricing action to address the inflationary pressure. Cooper Companies (COO) lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025, citing soft demand for contact lenses, and shares of the medical device maker dropped nearly 13%. Cooper's revenue for the third quarter also missed analysts' forecasts, although adjusted profit came in slightly ahead of estimates. Citi analysts downgraded Cooper stock to "neutral" from "buy." Shares of Brown-Forman (BF.B) sank 4.9% after the alcoholic beverage maker reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for its fiscal first quarter. Although the Jack Daniel's parent slightly surpassed estimates with its top-line results for the period, boosted by demand for its ready-to-drink beverages, sales were down from a year ago. The company discussed consumer uncertainty amid the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, noting that the absence of U.S.-made spirits in most Canadian markets added to pressure on its international business.

Title: The AI bubble may be about to pop — here’s what MIT’s 95% failure stat means

Full Content:
The AI bubble might be closer to bursting than anyone wants to admit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI market is undeniably booming. The six companies at the top of the world's valuation index, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are all deeply invested in AI in some form, and it seems like US stock markets are largely being held afloat by the unbelievable profits raked in by the firms. NVIDIA, the company supplying the world with an estimated 90% of the specialized GPUs required in AI data centers, recently became the first company to hit (and surpass) a $4 trillion market valuation. Microsoft also passed the $4 trillion valuation milestone roughly a week later, and it has invested a massive sum in OpenAI, its ChatGPT LLM, and Windows 11's Copilot AI assistant. Despite all of the promises and hypotheses from major AI players as to what their technology will unleash on the world, for good or for bad, tech trends and major studies have increasingly pointed to the AI boom being one massive bubble that will rival (or surpass) the dot-com era. A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative — a program designed to help develop a "true internet of AI agents" — suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage (via Fortune). A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage. MIT's research involves surveys and interviews with hundreds of employees and heads of firms, as well as outside analysis of hundreds of AI pilot programs that may or may not have found success before completely stalling out. What are those other 95% of AI pilot programs doing to fail? MIT's report suggests that it's the enterprise sector and its inability to easily adapt to AI tools that's the issue, rather than a lack of quality in the offered AI models. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. As Fortune points out, resource misallocation is also a cause, with "more than half of generative AI budgets" being spent on marketing tools rather than what makes the most money — using AI to automate and streamline. MIT's paper arrives about a month after a report from Gartner predicted that "at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025." When nearly every AI pilot winds up a cautionary tale, the most exceptional successes now stand out, not because they cracked some secret algorithm, but because they treated AI like any other high-stakes investment. The 5% that succeed start with a problem worth solving. Successful companies are not after generative AI because it's trendy, but because they are chasing inefficiencies or opportunities with measurable upside. That means setting KPIs (key performance indicators) before a line of code is written and attaching those metrics directly to revenue, cost savings, or reduced risk. They also build for adoption, not just proof-of-concept glory. Good pilots are built to fit in with what already exists with as little friction as possible, and the step from "pilot" to "production" should feel effortless. Finally, they have champions at every level—from engineers who can iterate rapidly to executives who appreciate their strategic value and are willing to protect the project from short‑term budget cutbacks. That cross-functional alignment maintains momentum when early results are messy and is usually the difference between a pilot that scales and one that stalls. In short, the successful 5% aren't just lucky. They are disciplined, purposeful, and relentlessly focused on business outcomes. Following the release of the MIT NANDA paper, tech stocks in the US shed about $1 trillion worth of value over the course of four days. The main culprit? Overevaluation of AI companies that have no problem sucking up billions of dollars in investments, with meager results to show. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — creator of the most popular AI model, ChatGPT — didn't help the situation. Five days earlier, The Verge interviewed Altman and quoted him as saying that AI is in a bubble. When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Altman's comments arrived following the disastrous rollout of OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5. GPT-5, which Altman hyped to incredible heights, was so bad that it forced OpenAI to resurrect older models, including GPT-4o. The catch? GPT-4o is no longer free, forcing users to pay a monthly subscription to return to what they viewed as the superior AI model. OpenAI's failure to live up to its GPT-5 promises didn't come out of nowhere. A report from 2024 suggested that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic had hit a wall in terms of developing advanced AI models. Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, predicted in 2023 that this type of plateau seen with GPT-5 would play out at some point. Consumer perception is not only a PR problem; it's a measure of survival. Now, AI is caught up in a hype wave that's half excitement, half suspicion. Each over‑promised rollout (hello there, GPT‑5) erodes public trust. When users feel like they're beta-testing half-baked technology, they're less likely to stick around — and less likely to rave about it within their companies or networks. Gary Marcus, a psychologist, cognitive scientist, and AI researcher who publishes the "Marcus on AI" Substack and newsletter — of which I've been an avid reader for the past 16 months — has also been sounding the AI bubble alarm for several years. A recent entry published August 20 from Marcus highlights the MIT NANDA study, stock market concerns, and the changing temperature surrounding AI firms and their promises. Marcus originally broached the AI bubble subject when OpenAI was still working with GPT-2, positing that the economics of AI simply don't make sense. As Marcus says, "But until recently enthusiasm kept rising and rising, no matter what I said." But then we all saw what happened with GPT-5; Altman spent years promising the moon, and in the end, long overdue, didn’t even come close to delivering. A lot of people took note. Leading figures in the AI world haven't been shy about laying out the destruction that AI will bring to white collar job sectors and even to humanity itself. And there's certainly the potential for this sort of dystopian future to arrive. But as I (and many others) have begun to suspect, these prosthelytizations could be more for the sake of bolstering hype and investments than accurate warnings of the future. AI has the potential to do great things, and I don't imagine it's going anywhere in the near future. But is there an inflating bubble that's threatening now more than ever to pop? Absolutely. What are your thoughts on the recent MIT study and the implications it has on the AI market? Is AI overhyped and in a massive bubble? Let me know in the comments section below!

The crypto market is paying close attention after one of the most famous early Bitcoin voices shared a bold view on XRP. Davinci Jeremie, who gained notoriety for advising people to buy Bitcoin at just $1 back in 2013, has now issued a strong forecast for XRP, noting that the token’s chart displays a healthy structure and a bullish pattern. In his detailed breakdown, Jeremie focused on XRP’s recent movements and the structure forming on its chart. He pointed to a clear W-shaped pattern as a bullish signal. According to him, the market action that pushed XRP higher in recent weeks appeared to be organic, with genuine investor activity providing support rather than artificial manipulation. Jeremie explained that he used the Fibonacci extension levels to calculate possible price targets for XRP. He said the 1.618 level comes in at 4,555 Chilean pesos, but he believes the token could go slightly higher. His projection puts the token at 4,761 pesos, which converts to about $4.93. If this outlook materializes, XRP would not only maintain its current momentum but also surpass its previous all-time high of $3.65, which it met in July of this year. According to the analyst, XRP’s earlier moves in late 2024 appeared forced, with extreme jumps that raised doubts, but this newest action looks more natural and could carry further implications. He emphasized that the chart math and price behavior support the path to further bullish growth, while the token’s structure itself demonstrates clear strength. What makes this analysis stand out even more is who it is coming from. Davinci Jeremie has long been regarded as a strong supporter of Bitcoin, often described as a Bitcoin maximalist. His early call for people to buy BTC when the price was at only $1 has given him lasting credibility in the cryptocurrency space. For that reason, his positive comments on XRP are being taken very seriously by many in the market. Jeremie emphasized that XRP’s moves from January to June formed a clean W formation on the weekly chart. He explained how the token reached a high of $ 3.40 in January, dropped to around $2.11 in April, rebounded to $2.60 in May, declined to near $2 in June, and then rallied strongly to surpass its January high. That sequence, he said, completed the pattern and opened the door for more gains. His change of tone shows that a strong market structure can override token bias. Even for someone who has close ties to Bitcoin, the health of XRP’s current chart was enough to spark a bullish outlook. Jeremie’s analysis suggests that more investors may start looking at XRP differently, seeing it as an asset with room to grow beyond old expectations.

Title: Bad AI Integration Has Consequences. How To Avoid Common Pitfalls

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. Bringing AI to your enterprise is an important step, but not doing it the right way can be costly. A new study from Infosys found that 95% of C-suite and director-level executives have had a negative experience with enterprise AI use in the last two years. These problems spanned a number of issues. About a third of all recipients reported they had experienced issues in each of these categories: privacy violations, systemic failures, inaccurate or harmful predictions, ethical violations, bias or discrimination, regulatory noncompliance or a lack of explainability. Of those who saw consequences from AI, 33% said the damage was substantial, while 39% classified it as severe—with a third of those saying the AI issues threatened their company’s existence. More than three quarters of companies negatively impacted by AI suffered financial losses, either through revenue lost or increased costs. This isn’t an indictment of AI as a technology, however. Infosys found that many of these companies had not yet laid the framework for responsible AI—determining rules and governance to ensure that AI is trustworthy, mitigates risk, protects data and functions with a degree of environmental sustainability. Fewer than 2% of the 1,500 companies Infosys surveyed for this report have a fully operational responsible AI framework, but the vast majority are starting on the path to develop these policies. In fact, 78% said they believe a responsible AI framework will increase business growth. More than four out of five said they believe regulations on AI would help them develop and further use the technology, bringing better clarity and confidence to AI compliance, with ethical and legal standards that will drive consumer trust. Creating workforce policies for responsible AI takes time and deep discussion, but it is possible. (And likely very necessary, since it does not look like there will be any widespread AI regulation in the U.S. in the near future.) Companies need to look at building trustworthy systems, which not only safeguard data, but also can explain their findings. Companies should also play an active role in observing what the AI systems are doing, and retooling the system when findings aren’t appropriate. They should consider things that might go wrong, and make sure the systems are secure and will perform accurately under these conditions. And they should ensure that they’re taking environmental sustainability into account. AI technology requires a lot of power, and as more entities embrace AI, energy demand will skyrocket. Energy efficient models will not only keep costs down, but minimize your carbon footprint. But as all tech leaders know, you don’t need AI for things to go wrong in an enterprise system. This summer, hacking network Scattered Spider has turned its attention to transportation, and has successfully disrupted flights and schedules for five airlines so far. I talked to Ian Ahl, CTO at identity security platform Permiso, about Scattered Spider, its tactics, and how you can prepare your company. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The world’s most valuable company had two huge pieces of news this week. Nvidia released its new AI “robot brain,” the Jetson AGX Thor, and (again) broke a record with its most recent earnings report. Nvidia’s Jetson Thor platform for industrial AI delivers 7.5x better AI performance than its predecessor, the Jetson AGX Orin, and has about 3.5x better energy efficiency, writes Forbes senior contributor Janakiram MSV. He writes that the new platform brings real-time, intelligent interaction with the physical world to industrial robots. With the chip, factory robots could be able to perform several tasks at once, like visible product inspection and coordination with other robots. Forbes senior contributor Dave Altavilla runs down the tech specs of the new platform and its developer tools. He writes that the platform is not only top-of-the-line for robotics—it uses Nvidia’s Blackwell technology—but it’s also furthering Nvidia’s current strategic focus: owning the high-end performance market. The Jetson Thor platform didn’t figure into Nvidia’s latest earnings report, released after markets closed on Wednesday, but the company once again had a record-setting quarter. Revenues were $46.7 billion, surpassing its record of $44.1 billion in the previous quarter, and beating economists’ forecasts. The largest portion of its revenues came from data centers, which brought in $41.1 billion. However, analysts predicted this area would come in at $41.3 billion. The miss brought a slight drop to Nvidia’s stock on Thursday morning. President Donald Trump has inserted the White House and federal government into business in an unprecedented way. Last week, he brokered a deal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in Intel. With this deal, the federal government will be the third-largest stakeholder in the publicly traded company, with its 10% share only behind a pair of 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. Intel had been promised close to $11 billion to support its manufacturing facilities through former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act. The equity stake is being cast as a redirection of those funds. Intel, which was one of the world’s hottest companies during the PC boom in the ‘90s, has had a relatively slow spell, but it’s nowhere near the point of imminent collapse. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been working to reinvigorate and refocus the chip maker since he took the helm in March, laying off employees, slowing down new facilities, and focusing on finding customers before increasing manufacturing capacity. Many policymakers and economists criticized Trump’s decision, saying it exposed the government to market risk, takes a step toward state-controlled industry and socialism, and is bringing unprecedented government intrusion into business. Trump dismissed those critics as “stupid,” and promised to make more deals like this one. He’s already inserted the federal government into the AI business, making a deal with Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China. The stock market has recently been on a tear, with the S&P 500’s total value up 84% in the last five years. But some wary investors are looking at the rapid rise and the big players, and envisioning a replay of the dotcom bubble a quarter century ago, writes Forbes’ Hank Tucker. Today, much like the late ‘90s, the IT sector makes up more than 33% of the S&P 500 index. And just like investors a quarter century ago bought up shares in internet companies, today’s investors are going all in on AI. Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of investment advisor Research Affiliates, told Tucker that today’s top companies tend to be great companies with great products, but bubbles burst when the margins are wrong—and they seem unrealistically optimistic around some of today’s high flyers. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge he thinks the AI market is in a bubble. Considering that Altman is one of the primary figures that started the boom, Forbes contributor Paulo Carvão writes, it’s worth heeding the warning. This summer, hacker group Scattered Spider has certainly helped make travel more difficult. After a warning from the FBI that they were likely to target airlines, Scattered Spider disrupted flights on five airlines in two months. Most of the attacks came as a result of deception, not sophisticated hacking, with hackers calling corporate help desks and impersonating actual employees, asking for—and getting—assistance in accessing those employees’ accounts. I talked to Ian Ahl, CTO at identity security platform Permiso Security, about Scattered Spider’s methods and how you can be ready for them on the cybersecurity front. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What should companies do to protect against these kinds of attacks? Ahl: There’s back-to-basics things. Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication really helps out. But when they call the help desk and the help desk disables that, that control is gone now. You almost have to assume there’s going to be a way around MFA. Everyone put a lot of faith that MFA solves everything. It does help quite a bit, but it is not a silver bullet there. You need visibility. I think a lot of organizations are kind of still stuck on the inventory posture phase of identity. You need to know what actions are actually taking account. You’ve got to get to that runtime detection phase if you want to really do anything. And then your basics still matter. Least privilege is needed for some of these organizations. A bad guy is going to steal some data from Snowflake. Well, they’re clicking in with an account that hasn’t touched Snowflake in 12 months. Should that account have Snowflake access? Probably not. Make sure you have visibility across all your applications, to include SaaS, which is unfortunately the hardest part, but is where attackers are learning most before they take action in environment. What about the help desk issue? If somebody calls the help desk and falsely claims to be somebody high level on the IT team or the CFO, what can be done to better thwart these attacks? Identity verification programs are a must. You can’t just rely on small bits of information. The hard thing with the help desk is it just takes one person who is not great at their job for the attacker to get through. And when [hackers] are doing this, they’re not doing it for just one identity. They’re calling for dozens of identities—and they’re English speaking and confident, and have a little bit of information to validate that they are who they say they are. Unfortunately, you’ve just got to do more. You almost can’t blame the help desk, either. This is what they’re designed to do: to be helpful in these situations. But most organizations, after they’ve gone through this, we see them putting in strong identity verification programs with their help desk to combat this in the future. Some of my peers in the industry are reporting deepfake videos. I haven’t seen that yet from this group, but I have heard cloned voices from them. So when they’re impersonating the CFO, they sound like the CFO. It has to be more than, ‘I recognize this voice and it sounds like this person.’ How are most companies doing with these protocols to stop these attacks? That’s the thing that is most concerning about this group for me. By the time an organization realized what’s going on—which may be hours or even less from when the incident occurred— [the hackers] have moved so far, they've captured so many other credentials that it is really hard to stop them, especially when they go from cloud to on-prem. You reset their password here in cloud. The bad guy just reset their password. It gets synced right back up to the cloud. You’re in this weird game. Where before it could take a couple days for [hackers] to really gain their feet in an environment, it’s just a couple of hours now. And for organizations that are doing well with this, I would say even some of the more high profile attacks that you've read about recently, these organizations do very well. They found it very quickly. They called in the right people, but the bad guy just moved too fast. Faster than they could. It seems that hackers are always coming up with new techniques. How can a CIO, CTO or CISO be vigilant and ward off anything that may be coming now or in the future? I would say focus more on the tactics than on the groups. The groups are going to change, but these tactics remain relatively the same. You want to put up as many speed bumps as possible to slow these guys down along the way. Is phishing-resistant MFA going to stop them? No. But it gives you more opportunity to catch them along that path. Is doing least privilege across all your applications a solution? Now we’re going to start seeing some errors along the way. Unfortunately, convenience for your employees is also convenience for the attackers. Even things like Copilot—in recent attacks from this group, instead of searching, they’ve prompted Copilot to go search SharePoint for me to figure out how to use the VPN. So do we stop our employees from being able to use Copilot? Do we restrict what type of data Copilot can use? Put up as many speed bumps as possible along that path to slow them down, give you the opportunity to disrupt them before they make it too far. When Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry said that the company processes anonymized proprietary log data to train AI models on new threat signals, it started a new debate on what trust means in an AI-enabled cybersecurity world. Here’s some ways to look at and discuss the concept, both from the provider and customer standpoint. Companies can innovate on their own, but in today’s world with its modern tech challenges, some of the best new ideas come through companies working together. Here’s a toolkit to build and scale productive partnerships for innovation. A court filing last week said that Elon Musk tried to get another tech billionaire to join his unsolicited bid to buy OpenAI. Who was it? A. Jeff Bezos B. Sergey Brin C. Larry Ellison D. Mark Zuckerberg See if you got the answer right here.

Title: Nvidia Stock Down 1.2%. Why Growth May Slow And Why Not To Buy $NVDA

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's Q2 2026 results beat overall expectations, but data center revenue fell short, primarily due to the lack of sales in China.The company's revenue and stock price growth rates are decelerating, with future explosive growth challenged by market saturation and elusive AI investment returns.Re-entry into the Chinese market offers significant revenue upside, but remains subject to geopolitical uncertainties. Nvidia stock fell 1.2% Wednesday after reporting record sales, falling short on data-center revenue, and predicting cooler growth, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this slight dip represent a buying opportunity? If Nvidia can accelerate revenue growth, its share price will rise. Here are three reasons that may not happen: Nvidia is optimistic about the company’s future. “This year is a record-breaking year,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, reported the Journal. “I expect next year to be a record-breaking year” as well, he added. With the exception of its data center business, Nvidia beat expectations in Q2 2026 and issued slower Q3 growth guidance – still ahead of analyst forecasts. Overall, the chip designer reported “better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%,” according to CNBC. Here are the key numbers: The absence of revenue from China affected Nvidia’s data center results. The company generated $33.8 billion in GPU data center sales – a 1% decline from the first quarter. The company sold $4 billion fewer H20 chips – which are designated for the Chinese market, Nvidia chief financial officer Colleen Kress said in a statement. Nvidia is bullish on its latest GPUs – the Blackwell line. Their revenue increased 17% between the first and second quarters – indicating “demand is extraordinary,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Journal. In May, Nvidia said Blackwell – which accounted for roughly 70% of data center revenue – reached $27 billion in sales, reported CNBC. The company sees tremendous growth ahead. The largest AI companies will spend $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, based on their current level of capital expenditures, and Nvidia could capture “as much as 70% of that revenue,” Huang said, according to the Journal. Will Nvidia’s efforts to revive sales in China succeed? The answer could depend on political considerations. During the quarter, after Huang met with President Donald Trump, Nvidia hinted it may get U.S. licenses to ship the H20 chip to China. Indeed the president “changed his mind in August and allowed H20 sales to resume after Huang visited the White House and pledged to give the federal government a 15% cut of AI-chip revenue earned in China,” the Journal reported. Meanwhile, Nvidia took $4.5 billion in writedowns because of the lack of sales and said the H20 would have added $8 billion in second-quarter had the company been able to sell them, CNBC noted. Kress told investors Nvidia could generate between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue during the current quarter if the geopolitical environment permits. Nvidia’s stock price growth depends on the company’s ability to grow faster than investors expect. The company’s growth and stock price have slowed down in parallel. How so? In 2023, Nvidia revenue was up 126%, according to Macrotrends, while the stock soared 230%, noted Google Finance. In 2024, the company’s revenue increased 113% while its stock price rose 194%. In the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased 56% and the stock has risen 29% so far this year. This suggests the stock will keep going up more slowly unless Nvidia can grow much faster. However, if the company resumed growing at 100% a year for the next decade, revenue would soar from $176 billion in the last year to $360 trillion in 2036. Sadly, such growth is impossible unless Nvidia targets new – much larger markets. After all, the global market for semiconductors is around $600 billion – much smaller than the gigantic 2036 revenue figure. Will Nvidia’s data center growth decelerate significantly? The answer depends on whether companies remain as eager as they now appear to be to use AI chatbots. For instance, enterprise technology spending grew 75% to $4.9 trillion in 2024 while large technology companies boosted AI capital expenditures from $245 billion in 2024 to $320 billion in 2025, according to Computerworld. Unfortunately, these capital expenditures have not yielded profits. That’s because 95% of companies surveyed received no return on their AI investment. Only 5% of companies generated returns on AI – which averaged 3.7 times what they invested, noted a report from the MIT NANDA Institute. If the economy contracts due to rising tariff-induced inflation and return on AI remains small, will companies keep spending so much on the technology? If companies cut back on their AI spending, it is only a matter of time before such a slowdown reduces Nvidia’s data center revenue growth even more? Investors see some upside in the stock. Nvidia’s shares could rise about 14% to reach the average price target of $205 per share set by 31 analysts covered by TipRanks. In my view the biggest potential for upside would happen if the Chinese market reopens for Nvidia. Unfortunately, that market could continue to be a political football. Unless Nvidia can find new growth opportunities, the best days of owning its stock may be in the rear view mirror.

August 28, 2025 13:17 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Nvidia Stock Falls After Earnings Report: Critical Price Levels to Keep an Eye On

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground Thursday morning even as the AI chipmaker and investor favorite reported revenue and profit that topped analysts' estimates. While the results, released late Wednesday, broadly came in slightly better than expected, sales in the data center segment, which comprise the bulk of the company's revenue, were slightly below Wall Street estimates. The outlook for the current quarter—which excludes sales of H20 chips to China amid uncertainty about whether exports to the country will resume—also disappointed some investors. Market participants have come to expect that Nvidia's results and guidance will always blow past expectations. Nvidia shares were down 1.5% at around $179 in midday trading. Coming into today's session the stock had gained 35% since the start of the year, making it the biggest gainer among members of the Magnificent 7 group of mega-cap technology stocks, amid booming demand from major companies building their AI infrastructure. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and use technical analysis to point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After registering a fresh all-time high earlier this month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways, indicating apprehension among market participants ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results. While the relative strength index remained in bullish territory leading into earnings, the indicator had made consistently lower highs since topping out in mid-July, signaling weakening buying momentum. Let’s identify key support levels to watch and point out an important overhead area worth eyeing if the stock rallies. Initial earnings-driven selling could see the shares test key support around $174. This area may attract buying interest near the mid-July peak and a minor retracement in the stock last week. A close below this location may lead to a retest of support at the $159 level. Investors could look for entry points in this area near the June high, which preceded a brief two-day dip before the stock resumed its uptrend. Further selling opens the door for a decline to the key $150 level. The shares would likely encounter support in this region never multiple peaks that formed on the chart between November and January. Interestingly, this level closely aligns with a downside bars pattern target that takes the move lower following the chipmaker’s 2024 third-quarter earnings report and repositions it from the stock’s recent highs. This analysis provides clues as to how a similar post-earnings profit-taking phase may unfold. If Nvidia shares resume their longer-term move higher, investors should eye the $183 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock’s recent trading levels just below the record high.

Title: Crypto Power Play: BlackRock Goes Big With Major Bitcoin And Ethereum Purchase

Time Published: 2025-08-28T16:00:22Z
Full Content:
As the bull market cycle continues, Bitcoin and Ethereum adoption are sharply heating up among prominent figures and large corporations in the ever-evolving financial landscape. In the last few days, institutions have gone on a significant buying spree, one of which is the asset management firm BlackRock. Bitcoin’s price has steadily faced notable price fluctuations, while Ethereum’s price has experienced a pullback from its recent all-time high. Despite this bearish performance from BTC and ETH, BlackRock is purchasing the two crypto leaders on a massive scale. According to the reports, the world’s largest asset manager has acquired a staggering $750 million worth of BTC and ETH. It is worth noting that this massive accumulation by the leading firm was made within two days. The report reveals that BlackRock bought about 413 BTC valued at $46 million, along with 73,864 ETH for a staggering $342 million on August 27. Prior to this huge purchase, the asset manager made another acquisition of 568 BTC for approximately $62.6 million, and 65,901 ETH valued at $292.6 million. This rapid accumulation underscores the firm’s growing conviction in crypto as an institutional-grade asset class. While signaling rising demand among institutional investors, the huge purchase in such a short span reinforces the idea that traditional finance is sharply intertwining with the crypto sector. Combining these acquisitions, the asset manager invested close to $750 million in its cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) products within a two-day window. In 2025, these purchases rank among the biggest single-day purchases made by a conventional financial institution. Large Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, often regarded as whales, have been gradually returning to the market. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain platform, has reported an uptick in BTC and ETH whales even as bearish pressure intensifies. This growth is observed among wallet addresses holding 1,000 BTC and wallet addresses holding at least 10,000 ETH. Such a trend from high-net-worth investors signals a possible change in market dynamics for the two assets. Their comeback coincides with a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency industry as investors balance the long-term growth trajectory of the assets against macroeconomic uncertainty. Data from the leading on-chain platform shows that there are now 13 more wallets holding 1,000 BTC, bringing the total to 2,087 wallets. Meanwhile, for Ethereum, there is now a total of 1,275 wallets holding 10,000 ETH following an additional 48 new wallets. At the time of writing, BTC and ETH were trading at $113,182 and $4,573, respectively, in the last 24 hours. While ETH’s trading volume has declined by over 13% in the past day, BTC’s trading volume is experiencing a slight upswing of nearly 5%. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Dollar General Bets Big on Stores With Nearly 4,900 Projects in 2025

Highlights Dollar General posted net sales of $10.7 billion and net income of $411 million, beating expectations as value-driven shoppers turned to its stores amid inflationary pressures. The company plans nearly 4,900 real estate projects in fiscal 2025, including 575 new stores, 15 in Mexico, and over 4,200 remodels across its Elevate and Renovate initiatives. Dollar General paused expansion of its high-margin pOpshelf concept but continues investing in digital convenience, including expanded delivery and same-day service. Retail is being rewritten in real time as price-pressured shoppers chase value.

Δ Dollar General said during its Thursday (Aug. 28) second-quarter 2025 earnings call that its business model is finely tuned to these shifting consumer dynamics. “We are pleased with our strong second-quarter results, including earnings growth that significantly exceeded our expectations,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a Thursday press release. “Our improved execution, along with our progress advancing key initiatives, is resonating with both existing and new customers as we further enhance our value and convenience proposition.” For the 13 weeks ended Aug. 1, Dollar General reported net sales of $10.7 billion, a 5.1% increase from $10.2 billion in Q2 2024. Net income reached $411 million, up 10% from $374 million in Q2 2024. While traditionally serving lower-income households, Dollar General increasingly attracts middle- and high-income shoppers trading down amid rising costs and seeking bargain alternatives for routine needs. Read also: As Households Stretch Paychecks, Off-Price Retail Stretches Profits For fiscal 2025, the company expects approximately 4,885 real estate projects, including 575 new stores in the United States and up to 15 in Mexico, the release said. Nearly 4,250 remodels will be completed across the two major initiatives. This level of construction and remodeling is unmatched in the U.S. discount sector and reflects Dollar General’s conviction that small-box convenience remains a durable retail format even in an age of eCommerce and big-box consolidation. In the three-month period representing Q2, the company opened 204 new stores, remodeled 729 locations under “Project Elevate,” remodeled 592 more under “Project Renovate,” and relocated 15 stores, the release said. Projects Elevate and Renovate are not merely cosmetic. Elevate is designed as a partial remodel that refreshes merchandising, reduces maintenance costs and enhances customer experience. Renovate involves full remodels that upgrade layouts, product selections and equipment. Both are intended to improve the balance between the company’s low-margin, high-traffic consumable goods and its high-margin, non-consumable goods. See also: Discounts Lure High-Income Customers to Dollar Stores Dollar General’s management commentary on Thursday’s earnings call illustrated the precarious environment its shoppers face. The company’s core customers are disproportionately affected by inflation, higher rent and energy costs, and resumed student loan repayments. While food and household goods sales have held up, discretionary spending in seasonal, home and apparel categories remains pressured. The sales mix underscores this tension. Consumables accounted for more than 82% of sales in Q2, rising 5% year over year to $8.82 billion, per the press release. Seasonal and home products grew more modestly, while apparel posted only slight gains. The heavy weighting toward consumables secures traffic but dampens gross margin expansion. PYMNTS Intelligence’s July Paycheck-to-Paycheck research showed that 78% of low-income households, defined as those earning less than $50,000 a year, and 66% of middle-income households, defined as those earning between roughly $50,000 and $100,000 a year, said they were living paycheck to paycheck in June. Perhaps the most telling shift in strategy involves Popshelf, Dollar General’s relatively new retail concept aimed at high-margin categories like home décor, beauty and seasonal goods. Originally envisioned as a growth vector, pOpshelf has faced headwinds in the current environment. In Q2, the company operated 180 standalone locations, but it has paused new openings in 2025, Business Back reported Sunday (Aug. 24). Some Popshelf sites are being converted back to Dollar General stores. Despite its brick-and-mortar foundation, Dollar General continues to invest in digital channels. The company partnered with Uber Eats this month to deliver household essentials. In September 2024, it launched same-day home delivery via its own app and website in select markets. That service is rolling out more broadly in 2025, positioning Dollar General to compete for convenience with grocery delivery providers and Walmart’s expansive online network. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has tracked the impact of tariffs on consumers throughout the spring and summer. For example, the June report, “Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability,” showed 47% of U.S. shoppers said they could not find or afford everyday items because tariffs led to supply chain disruptions or higher price tags.

Title: Capcom Has Reportedly Tried And Failed To Remake Dino Crisis A Few Times

Black Myth WukongDino CrisisMorning Checkpoint Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, Kotaku’s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how Black Myth: Wukong runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake Dino Crisis a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough that it’s not changing its logo after all. Fans have been begging Capcom for a new Dino Crisis for many, many years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes a game with dinosaurs, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of Dino Crisis isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise. The leaker claims that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the Dead Rising sequels, was working on a remake of Dino Crisis before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more Dino Crisis. Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got Resident Evil back on track with RE7, the publisher can get Dino Crisis going again. Here’s something odd: Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, Wukong on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes. This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with Black Myth: Wukong. On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next Tomb Raider game for Amazon, announced another round of layoffs. The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of Tomb Raider” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March. âToday we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted. There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC. âMany studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin earlyâbefore full content build-out. Weâre doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so âoptimize earlyâ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.” Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s Black Panther game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes Shadow of Mordor and Rome: Total War.Â “We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there â and many of them at Monolith â to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new â and that part I can’t tell you yet.” If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&M lore.

Title: Why Wall Street is boosting forecasts for Nvidia stock even higher after a lukewarm reaction to earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-nvda-outlook-wall-street-forecast-q2-earnings-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-28T15:14:18Z

For a company like Nvidia, which is used to blowing the doors off earnings reports, Wednesday wasn't the best day. While the chipmaking giant beat second-quarter revenue and earnings, the vibes were lukewarm at best, and the move in the stock price showed it. Shares quickly slid as much as 4% in the after-market before recovering a bit. They remained about 1% lower in regular Thursday trading. But if there's anything to worry about, analysts are shrugging it off. The broad consensus across Wall Street is that Nvidia's earnings report was good enough to unlock further stock upside in the future. Below is a sampling of this bullish push — five banks that raised their price targets in the immediate aftermath of Nvidia earnings, and why they did so. Rating: Overweight New price target: $215 (up from $170) Reasoning: JPMorgan sees enough demand for Nvidia's Blackwell products to support the company's revenue guidance of $54 billion for the following quarter. Demand for Nvidia's H20 chip, meanwhile, could provide as much as $2 billion to $5 billion in extra revenue for the following quarter, analysts estimated, despite uncertainty surrounding US trade restrictions with China. "Overall, we believe NVIDIA's 12-month forward order book continues to outstrip supply," the bank wrote in a client note. "All in, the playbook remains the same here for NVDA - a solid beat and raise with multiple levers at play to drive upside, against the backdrop of a multi-year runway of growth for AI infrastructure spending, with NVDA in our view continuing to capture a significant majority of the incremental spend," it added. Rating: Neutral New price target: $195 (up from $135) Reasoning: DA Davidson, which once said it believed 2025 would be a "peak year" in the AI cycle, said it no longer believed that to be the case. "While we are maintaining our Neutral rating we would like to highlight our perspective on NVDA has shifted quite a bit over the last 6 months," analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. "We now believe demand growth for inference will sustain for the foreseeable future," it added, pointing to progress made on AI models over the last year. Rating: Buy New price target: $240 (up from $235) Reasoning: The research firm highlighted Jensen Huang's comments on Nvidia's earnings call, where the CEO estimated that capex on data centers could boom to around $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. The chipmaker also said it saw a $2 trillion total addressable market in the computing and networking business. That could "portend to big numbers" for Nvidia, Melius added, reiterating its forecast that the company's annual revenue could surpass $600 billion by the end of the decade. "People will regret focusing on the near-term," analysts wrote on Thursday. "We reiterate our Buy rating and are still excited about Sovereign and hyperscaler demand driving upside for multiple years," the firm added, though it noted it was taking out China as part of its estimates for the firm going forward. Rating: Buy New price target: $228 (up from $210) Reasoning: Nvidia still has "significant growth potential," Truist analysts wrote, despite the firm's latest guidance falling slightly below expectations. "We recognize this as a minor imperfection, and instead focus on management's resilient longer-term outlook," the firm said in a note on Wednesday. The firm highlighted 3 catalysts that could take Nvidia higher over the long run: "NVDA remains *the* AI company. Buy," the note added. Rating: Overweight New price target: $210 (up from $206) Reasoning: Nvidia handily "cleared the bar" with its second-quarter results, despite doubts looming over China, Morgan Stanley said. In a note to clients, analysts said they believed Nvidia's earnings-per-share valuation was still supported by improving gross profit margins and demand growth for its products, like the company's Blackwell ramp. Nvidia also remains on track to launch its Rubin chip next year, and demand for AI computing is still growing, analysts noted. "Nvidia has a tendency to rerate quickly when there is a wall of worry to climb; we don't have that today," analysts wrote in a note. "It's easier to make the case for upside when there is a fundamental overhang on the stock, but even without one the financial profile of mid 50s+ % y/y growth in revenue with >60% operating margins will remain attractive as long as beats and raises continue - where our confidence remains high."

Title: Reilly embracing the competition to be Ireland's No 9

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist There's no position in the Ireland women’s team as hotly contested right now as scrum-half. Over the last 18 months, Scott Bemand has narrowed his selections down bit by bit to the point where there is no debate around his first choice in several positions. Niamh O’Dowd, Neve Jones and Linda Djougang are the locked-in front row for big games. Ruth Campbell, Sam Monaghan, Aoife Wafer, Dannah O’Brien, Aoife Dalton, Amee-Leigh Costigan and Stacey Flood also appear to be guaranteed their shirts if fit. At scrum-half, Aoibheann Reilly, Emily Lane and Molly Scuffil-McCabe have been rotating in and out. The margin between starting and missing out on the matchday 23 has been razor thin. Lane and Scuffil-McCabe shared the jersey during WXV1 campaign in Canada last year while Reilly was still on her way back from an ACL injury, with Scuffil-McCabe starting the win against New Zealand, before Lane got the nod in the games against Canada and USA. In the Six Nations, it looked as though Lane was top of the scrum-half rotation when she started the games against France and England, with Reilly (above) impressing in her chance in the 9 jersey away to Italy. Bemand continued to rotate, with Scuffil-McCabe brought into the starting side for the final two Six Nations outings, and she kept her place for the first World Cup warm-up against Scotland. For the visit of Canada, Reilly came back in, and she impressed again in Ireland's Pool C opener against Japan last week. Just as it seemed the 24-year-old had taken the jersey for herself, it now looks like another rotation is on the cards for Spain on Sunday. "That's what you want, you want competition in your squad," says Reilly, who started last week's win against the Sakura XV. "We always knew that the World Cup was coming up and it's only fair that everyone gets a chance and play with different combinations and see what works best for the team. "And we're blessed that we have depth there, because someone's game style might suit an opposition better than the other." A tally of the numbers sums up how unpredictable Bemand’s thinking has been around scrum-half. In the last 11 games, Lane is the only player to have featured in every game, but only four of those have been starts, and she hasn’t started since Round 3 of the Six Nations. Scuffil-McCabe (above) has played six times, with four of those from the start, while Reilly has started three of her five appearances. "We have depth there now, whereas maybe we didn't have it as much before," said Reilly. "And you're starting to see that not just at scrum-half, but other positions now, where other girls can put their hand up every week and there's constant competition there which is only driving us on as a squad." With Bemand and assistant coach Larissa Muldoon both former scrum-halves, Reilly says there is "constant feedback" to the trio of 9s. "It's definitely evolved me as a player and helped me see the game differently," she adds. "They both come and give different advice about different things but it's great to have the both of them, and they're all aligned with our style of play, which is great. "All of us are very different and we have different elements to our game so it's just really what suits the team at the weekend. We all compete really well together, so it's great that we're all there, pushing each other on. "I like playing with a fast-tempo game, lots of running lines. That’s probably the style I like most." Getting to a World Cup has been a milestone achievement for the Blackrock and Connacht scrum-half, given she has come back from two ACL injuries in recent seasons. Representing Ballinasloe is also a driving factor. One of three Ballinasloe RFC products in this Irish squad, Reilly has been playing with Béibhinn Parsons and Meabh Deely since she was a child. "It's unreal. It's hard to explain because it's all we've ever known," she said. "We were always on the same teams together but it's so cool to see how the town has gotten behind us. "There’s huge posters up around Ballinasloe of the three of us which is surreal, but, yeah, it's really special. "My family was over last weekend. I think they're going to all the games to support the girls and my brother came over from New York. "And it's actually his first time seeing me live so he's over for the month, which is great. "And then my other brother [Colm], he plays with Connacht so he's hoping to come for the New Zealand games. "He can't quite get it off training but it's great to have the support over. And there's so many Irish in the crowd last weekend, which was class." Listen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang advises AI customers to 'pace themselves' after GPU clusters sell out, but the company says it's going to continue to scale up

What am I humming? Bubble Pop by HyunA, for no particular reason. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia has been on a tear. Just in case you've been living under a nice mossy rock the past few years, the advent of generative AI has ushered in a golden era for the company. Let's talk some truly eye-watering facts and figures: during Nvidia's Q2 2025 earnings call, the company reported a total revenue of $46.7 billion. Okay, so it's more like a diamond-encrusted-with-foie-gras-on-the-side era, but it's been far from smooth sailing. As such, with the next-gen Rubin architecture just off the horizon and data centre demand continuing to grow, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during the aforementioned earnings call, "We advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves." It's bizarre to hear the head of a company making bank say anything to the effect of 'actually, hold your horses,' but Huang advises that Nvidia's AI customers build "data centers on an annual rhythm." Why? There are more than a few potential reasons, ranging from the ever-changing tariff situation in the US, to potential strain on what may well be an AI bubble. But, specifically referring to Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPU clusters often used in AI data centres, Huang had this to say: "Right now, the buzz is — I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything sold out." We've also seen stock supply issues on the gaming side. Early supplies of RTX 50-series GPU stock left much to be desired, making it an absolute mission to find a card at MSRP only a few months ago. Still, gaming alone raked in $4.3 billion for Nvidia, according to the Q2 2025 earnings call. Thankfully, it's a little easier to find a 50-series card at a reasonable price now, as our best graphics cards deals guide can attest. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's AI revenue vastly overshadows even the billions made by its gaming division. As such, Huang kept these priorities in sight as he reassured investors that Nvidia was taking steps to avoid similar scarcity with Rubin later this year. In his closing remarks, Huang said, "Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represent the Rubin platform. They have all ticked up at TSMC. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack scale AI supercomputer, and so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Given the constantly shifting US tariff situation and its far-reaching effects on the wider geopolitical stage, it's hard to comment on the projected success of even the best laid plans. And then there's the fact that major player Meta is actually looking to downsize its own AI division—could this herald the shape of things to come for AI's place within big tech? If Huang suspects as much, he didn't let on, instead saying, "Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 trillion to $4 trillion global AI factory build out through the end of the decade." 👉Check out our full guide👈 1.

Title: Layoffs are about to hit Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital advertising group
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/martin-sorrell-s4-capital-ad-group-monks-layoffs-imminent-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:33:20Z

Changes are afoot at advertising mogul Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital. On Thursday, Monks, S4 Capital's operating brand, informed staffers of a restructuring that includes layoffs, according to a screenshot of an internal presentation viewed by Business Insider. The slide detailed how employees whose roles could be affected would be informed this week. In the UK, if more than 20 employees are affected by a layoff in a 90-day period, the company is required to enter a collective consultation process with representatives for the employees. S4 is headquartered in the UK. The presentation said that the "reshaping of teams," including reporting lines, redeployment, and changes to roles or departments, would commence on September 5. "Managing our cost base effectively is a key priority in this environment and we have continued to work to streamline and integrate our businesses," an S4 spokesperson said in a statement. The company declined to comment on how many roles would be affected by the restructure. The layoffs come as advertising agencies face multiple challenges, with tough macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions making marketers cautious about their spending. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has so far proven to be a double-edged sword — helping make agencies more productive and provide consulting services on how to use the technology, while also threatening to automate many of the services that were once outsourced to them. S4 launched in 2018 with a bang, just weeks after Sorrell's bitter exit from WPP, the firm he built over 33 years from a shell company that made shopping baskets to a $20 billion advertising juggernaut. Sorrell set out a vision for S4 to be everything WPP, in his view, was not. Smaller and more nimble, S4 would only focus on digital marketing and would be "faster, better, cheaper" than the incumbents, he said at the time. Sorrell repeated his WPP playbook of building the company through acquisitions — this time at warp speed. S4's fortunes took a turn in 2022. The group was a casualty of the "years of efficiency" undertaken by many Big Tech giants around that time. Tech companies make up a sizable chunk of S4's client portfolio. It also faced internal challenges, including underperformance at some of its agencies and an auditing issue that forced it to delay the release of its annual report that year. S4's market value plunged and has remained depressed, encouraging takeover sharks to circle in recent years. Earlier this month, S4 issued a statement to confirm a press report that it had entered early discussions with the private-equity-backed ad agency MSQ Partners about a possible merger between the two companies. MSQ Partners later issued a statement denying its involvement in those talks. The statement said that while there may have been informal discussions between its majority shareholder, One Equity Partners, and S4, it didn't plan to pursue further talks about a possible transaction. During S4's annual general meeting in June of this year, Sorrell said the agency's 2024 performance had been affected by challenging macroeconomic conditions, high interest rates, and technology clients prioritizing capital expenditure over operating expenditure, such as marketing, amid the AI race. Sorrell said S4 was anticipating better performance in the second half of 2025, having recently picked up new business from the likes of General Motors, Amazon, and T-Mobile. Still, S4 said it expected full-year net revenue to be down this year versus last. "The strategy of S4 Capital remains the same. Our four principles around digital only, data-driven 'faster, better, cheaper and more' or 'speed, quality, value and more' and a unitary structure all appeal strongly, even more so in challenging economic times," the S4 spokesperson's statement said. S4 has been working to improve its operating margins and reduce its net debt, in part by reducing staff through multiple layoffs in recent years. According to the company's latest regulatory statement, its head count has dropped to roughly 6,800 as of August 22, from around 9,000 at its largest. The company is due to release its interim financial results on September 15. Jump to

Title: Concerns Grow As Strategy Issues More Stocks To Buy Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:30:33Z

Strategy’s latest stock sale to buy more Bitcoin has put investor nerves on edge, as numbers and timing raise fresh doubts about shareholder dilution and the company’s funding choices. Based on reports, Strategy changed its public guidance on August 18 and then, within days, moved to issue a large amount of new stock. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn traced the pattern: no fresh issuance on Aug. 3, roughly $18 million on Aug. 10, about $51 million on Aug. 17 — then close to $360 million raised in a single week after the guidance change. That sharp jump in new capital has drawn scrutiny from market watchers who worry the company is leaning on share issuance to keep buying Bitcoin. The new rules link stock sales to something called market net asset value, or mNAV, which compares the company’s share price to the value of its Bitcoin. Strategy running out of steam? 🚂💨 Before Aug 18, almost no new money came into $MSTR: 🔹 Aug 3: $0 🔹 Aug 10: ~$18M 🔹 Aug 17: ~$51M But after they dropped the “no dilution below 2.5x mNAV” promise, $359M was raised by issuing new shares (see tweet below). Policy changed.… https://t.co/nenuT1soI3 pic.twitter.com/pORoidxPhf — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 26, 2025 If the stock trades at more than four times its mNAV, the company will sell lots of shares to buy more Bitcoin. If it trades between 2.5 and four times, it will sell some shares, but more carefully. And if the stock drops below 2.5 times, share sales would mostly go toward paying debt or covering dividends instead of buying Bitcoin. Reports add that if Strategy shares trade under 1x mNAV, the company could borrow to repurchase stock. That framework reversed an earlier pledge not to sell shares for Bitcoin purchases when mNAV was below 2.5x — a reversal that critics point to as the key change. According to the company’s SEC filing, nearly $310 million came from at-the-market common stock sales at an average share price of $354, plus roughly $47 million from preferred share classes. In total, the firm raised a little more than $357 million and used the proceeds to buy 3,081 Bitcoin. The purchase pushed its holdings to 632,457 BTC. That stack of 632,457 coins equals roughly 3% of circulating supply, based on market counts cited in filings and market reports. The company’s public target remains at 1 million coins — a goal that, by the reported figures, is now about 60% complete. Investors focused on dilution have reason to be worried. Each new share increases the number of claims on the same Bitcoin pool, and when issuance happens while the stock trades at low multiples to mNAV, existing holders see their per-share Bitcoin backing decline. Reports say Strategy’s debt sits at about 20% of Bitcoin NAV with headroom up to 30%, giving it borrowing room — but choosing to issue equity at low mNAVs still weakens per-share economics.

Title: Globalists Are Rebranding Their “Woke Capitalism” Agenda After Crushing Setbacks

Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Economy Alt-Market.us, Brandon Smith People who carefully track the machinations of globalist institutions might have noticed a disturbing atmosphere of silence since the 2024 elections. I discussed this trend a few months ago in my article “Globalists Go Radio Silent As NATO Flirts With World War III”, specifically the dramatic shift that has taken place since the pandemic when organizations like the World Economic Forum ripped the mask off completely and admitted their true authoritarian intentions. By the end of 2021, most of the world was under maniacal technocratic control and the globalists seemed to think they had western civilization by the balls. The elites were constantly in the media openly touting their plans, from perpetual covid lockdowns, to vaccine passports, to climate lockdowns, to cashless digital monetary systems where all economic liberty is lost, to the “sharing economy” where private property is abolished, to the Fourth Industrial Revolution in which AI runs everything, to the “Great Reset” which would completely undermine the free market system and herald a socialist dystopia. In my 20 years as an economist, writer and analyst in the liberty movement I have never seen the globalists reveal their true intentions so brazenly. The pandemic exposed an incredible number of people to the underlying reality of the “New World Order” and in that span of around three years the awakening skyrocketed. The number of patriots born during covid was unprecedented. People realized it wasn’t a mere conspiracy theory. World events were not simply random products of chance and chaos. There was indeed a smoky god-damn room filled with nefarious plotting parasites. The march towards global governance was real and now everyone except the dumbest of the dumb knows it. The powers-that-be were so confident in the success of their endeavor that they essentially proclaimed global government by bureaucrats and corporations in the very midst of covid. Calling it the “Council for Inclusive Capitalism” working in collusion with the Vatican. The question we have to ask today is, where did it all go? The globalists were so confident and bold and now they are reticent. Did they give up? Or, are they rebranding their agenda yet again? For example, in 2020 almost no one knew what ESG was. By 2023 everyone understood that the meaningless acronym for “Environmental, Social, Governance” is actually an insidious cover designed to hide the woke capitalism agenda. Woke capitalism, also known as inclusive capitalism, is a centralization program which links together governments, bureaucratic agencies, NGOs as well as international banks and corporations under one ideological umbrella (globalism, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change, etc). This massive cartel uses monetary incentives and extortion to force businesses and individuals to conform to a woke/socialist model. For the last decade these groups have been funding a suffocating propaganda campaign, forcing woke indoctrination onto the masses. However, the globalists didn’t comprehend the level of push-back that they ultimately encountered. In their arrogance, they ended up inspiring more resistance, not less. And so, terms like ESG and DEI are being abandoned. Even Lynn Forester de Rothschild, head of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, was forced to admit that ESG is dead and needs to be rebranded. Within the occult methodology the natural solution would be to adopt new organizations and new names but maintain the same goals. I’ve noticed that this happens often with the globalists. At one point the majority of their planning was done within the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group. Then it was the Club Of Rome and the UN. Then it was the IMF. Then the focus switched to Davos and the WEF. They used the term “New World Order”, then switched to “Multipolar World Order”, then to “the Great Reset” and the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. This makes it very difficult for researchers to track the most current mechanisms of the conspiracy. I have found that, in the last year, “Stakeholder Capitalism” has become the fresh code for much of their renewed efforts. It’s not a new term, but it is being used more often by the elites to draw less attention. Some use the phrase “stakeholder capitalism 3.0” or “third phase stakeholder capitalism”. The original idea being that corporations can no longer make profits a priority. Rather, they must produce equal outcomes (not just equal opportunities) in order to participate in the interdependent international economy. In order to get access to the system, companies must promote approved narratives on climate and social justice, as well as partner with governments and NGOs to make DEI equity a reality. The companies that don’t participate will face pressure from government officials and will not be able to compete with companies that comply. The problem is, this requires that meritocracy be erased and that producers be forced to subsidize feeders on a planetary scale. That is to say, stakeholder capitalism is global communism cloaked in the humanist costume of corporate responsibility. The World Economic Forum seems to be doubling down on ESG and stakeholder capitalism with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink at the helm, despite growing public opposition. Though, Blackrock has removed a majority of ESG and DEI related language from their corporate reports. I recently came across an article published at the end of July from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance which outlines the more discreet evolution of ESG (and DEI) in 2025. It reiterates similar observations made by globalists over the past year, that ESG must be rebranded but not abandoned. It argues that the old political virtue signaling and compliance checklists of the last decade must be set aside (for now) and that stakeholder capitalism should be presented as a “win-win” for the companies and communities involved. It is, in a way, an attempt to sell conservatives on the idea of ESG. One argument is that companies that engage in ESG-like policies “make more money” and gain more share value. Limited data is produced to support this claim, and I would point out that stock markets overall have been on a frightening bull run since the election. Companies that are NOT engaging in ESG are doing just as well as those that are, at least…in the US. Harvard notes that outflows from ESG funds are prevalent in America, but in the EU they are becoming more successful. I’m seeing similar trends in Canada and Australia – Anywhere that governments are working with globalists to enforce DEI standards on companies, ESG funds are obviously going to outperform. It’s a cartel, remember, and western political leaders are the enforcers. The US is the only place where ESG is in retreat. This could change in the near term as Europeans grow increasingly rebellious against the multicultural coup, but it does illustrate the fact that woke capitalism (stakeholder capitalism) cannot survive without government intervention. This is not to say that progress in the fight against globalism has not been made. I grow tired of blackpilled mouth-breathers that act as if there have been no victories and that everything is going “according to the globalist plan”. If this was true then they would have proudly and publicly moved forward with their Great Reset instead of running back into the shadows. That said, vigilance requires temperance. Behind the scenes many corporations are still introducing woke policies and they are even advancing the globalist takeover in Europe. The fight must focus on these specific companies and their NGO partners; it is not the job of corporations (or leftist politicians and NGOs) to enact social engineering. They are not qualified to determine the greater good because they are not good people. They are driven by the desire for power, not morality or reason. The globalists have lost the information war, but they keep coming back because they have yet to face real world consequences for their hubris. The only way to end the nightmare permanently is to dissolve the structures that give them their influence, or, remove them from the equation entirely.

Title: Tomb Raider Dev Crystal Dynamics Cuts Staff For Second Time This Year

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The latest round of layoffs comes almost two months after the cancellation of the Perfect Dark reboot. By Evan Campbell on August 28, 2025 at 7:04AM PDT Developer Crystal Dynamics is laying off more members from the team, though not detailing the total number of people impacted. This is the second round of cuts at the Tomb Raider studio within the last six months--and the first since the Perfect Dark reboot was canned. On LinkedIn, the official Crystal Dynamics account announced the layoffs. "This decision was not made lightly," the post reads. "It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The language is pretty similar to what Crystal Dynamics stated after 17 people were laid off in March: "We did not make this decision lightly." The biggest known project at Crystal Dynamics currently is the next Tomb Raider. The game starring Lara Croft will be published by Amazon Games, and Crystal Dynamics noted that "the future of Tomb Raider" is "unaffected by this decision." Earlier this year, the developer stated that the next Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark reboot wouldn't be affected by downsizing, either. However, Microsoft canceled Perfect Dark--a game that Crystal Dynamics was co-developing--last month. The other main studio working on the game, The Initiative, was shuttered. Amazon was also previously working on a Tomb Raider show, but that's reportedly dead now. Along with Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is known for the Gex and Legacy of Kain video game franchises.

Title: Plant-Based Savings: Cut Grocery Bills 19% in 15 Minutes
URL: https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/plant-based-savings-cut-grocery-bills-19-in-15-minutes/
Time Published: 2025-08-28T13:39:49Z

Got 15 minutes and a wallet that's feeling a little light? Here's how to slash your grocery bills while eating amazing plant-based meals. Research shows that switching to a whole-food vegan diet can cut food costs by 19 percentâthat's about $650 in savings per year. The secret isn't complicated: plant-based staples like brown rice, potatoes, and beans are some of the cheapest and healthiest ingredients in the supermarket. Plus, inflation has hit meat at nearly twice the rate of vegetables, making this the perfect time to master these money-saving plant-based hacks. The foundation of budget vegan cooking lies in stocking up on versatile, shelf-stable ingredients that work in dozens of recipes. Dried beans and rice are ridiculously cheap and often overlookedâa 5-pound bag of brown rice plus 2 pounds of frozen broccoli costs about $6 and lasts for weeks. Buying staples in bulk is huge, since these ingredients can transform into burgers, taco fillings, hummus, and much more. Plant proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu are economical choices that pack serious nutrition without the premium price tag. Here's where smart pantry building gets interesting: focus on ingredients that multitask across cuisines. That same cup of brown rice gives you 5 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fiber, and when you combine that with half a cup of broccoli, you're up to 7 grams of protein and 5.5 grams of fiber. But the real magic happens when you learn to season these basics differentlyâcumin and lime for Mexican bowls, ginger and soy for Asian stir-fries, or herbs and lemon for Mediterranean grain salads. Pro tip: Hit up Asian or Latin grocery stores for bulk rice, grains, and spices at unbeatable prices. Stock your freezer with frozen vegetablesâthey're flash-frozen at peak ripeness to retain nutrients and cost a fraction of fresh out-of-season produce. Planning isn't just about organizationâit's your secret weapon against impulse buys and food waste. Taking a few minutes before your store trip to map out meals and compile a shopping list saves both time and money. Plan meals around affordable staples like rice, beans, lentils, and seasonal vegetables, then build variety around those base ingredients. Budget-friendly couples have managed to eat for just $15 Canadian per dayâthat's less than $2.50 per meal by focusing on smart planning. The brilliant thing about strategic planning is how it actually unlocks creativity rather than limiting it. When you know you've got rice, black beans, and frozen corn as your weekly foundation, you can transform them with different spice blends: Monday gets Mexican flair with cumin and lime, Wednesday goes Asian with ginger and soy sauce, Friday turns Mediterranean with herbs and lemon. This rotation strategy means you're buying the same affordable base ingredients but never eating boring meals. Build your weekly menu around one-pot meals, grain bowls, and soups that stretch ingredients into multiple servings. Batch cooking is perfect for bulk ingredientsâcook once and you're set for days, saving time you could use for side gigs or just relaxing. Your shopping strategy can make or break your budget. Choose store brands over name brandsâthey're often identical products for a fraction of the cost. Shop the perimeter where whole foods like fresh produce, grains, and legumes live, avoiding the expensive processed foods in center aisles. Embrace "ugly" vegetablesâthat imperfect carrot is just as nutritious as the pristine one but costs way less. Timing your shopping trips strategically can unlock serious savings most people miss entirely. Shop early weekday mornings when stores are fully stocked and crowds are minimal. Focus on seasonal produce when it's abundant and naturally cheaperâsummer squash in July, root vegetables in fall, citrus in winter. Use apps like "Our Groceries" that allow multiple users to update the same listâperfect for couples, roommates, or families who want to coordinate their shopping without duplicate purchases. Shopping rotation hack: Get to know different stores' strengths. Hit budget stores for dried beans, pasta, and canned goods. Save the fancy grocery trips for fresh produce, nuts, and specialty items. Frozen organic vegetables are often much less expensive at warehouse stores like Costco. The magic happens when you learn to make expensive alternatives at home using whole foods. Making seitan costs as little as 50p for a bag of flour versus several dollars for store-bought versions. Aquafaba (that liquid from chickpea cans) whips into mayo in 10 seconds flat. Dehydrated soya chunks can be much cheaper than frozen proteins and rehydrate into satisfying, meaty textures. The learning curve here is gentler than you'd expect, and the payoff is huge. Take that basic tahini dressing: blend tahini, lemon juice, water, and a pinch of salt, and you've got something that costs pennies but rivals expensive store-bought dressings. Store it in the fridge for up to a week, or make flavor variations by adding garlic for punch, herbs for freshness, or maple syrup for subtle sweetness. This one simple sauce elevates everything from grain bowls to roasted vegetables to raw salads. A pack of dried beans yields roughly double its weight when cooked, so 500g gives you the equivalent of four drained tins at a fraction of the cost. Zero-waste cooking means using every part of your ingredients to reduce food waste and get more from what you already have. Save vegetable scraps in the freezer to make broth at homeâthose onion skins, carrot tops, and herb stems create rich, flavorful stock for free. Use all parts of your produce, including dual-use vegetables like carrots with their leafy tops. This isn't about being a perfectionistâit's about being practical with preservation techniques that actually save money. That bunch of cilantro you bought for tacos? Chop the stems into your freezer scrap bag for broth, blend any wilting leaves into ice cube trays with olive oil for instant flavor bombs, or quickly blanch and freeze whole sprigs in bags for later use. These simple preservation methods mean you're getting multiple uses from single purchases. Repurpose leftovers creatively to minimize waste and stretch your grocery dollars. That leftover rice becomes fried rice, grain salads, or soup base. Wilting greens get a second life in smoothies, soups, or pesto. Freeze unused produce before it spoilsâthose browning bananas are perfect for smoothies and baking. The bottom line? Plant-based eating can cost less than $2 per serving with the right approach. Studies consistently show that people eating plant-based spend less on food than any other group, with savings jumping to $900 annually compared to Mediterranean diets. The core of a vegan dietâwhole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruitsâis among the most affordable foods available. You don't need to go full vegan overnight to see these benefits. Start with Meatless Monday and gradually build your confidence with one new plant-based recipe each week. Focus on mastering a few simple, satisfying base recipes firstâlike a versatile grain bowl template or a basic bean and vegetable soupâthen expand your skills as you discover which flavors and techniques you enjoy most. The beauty of this approach is that you're not just saving money now, you're building sustainable cooking skills that compound over time. Your grocery budgetâand your healthâwill reward you for making the switch to these smart, sustainable eating habits.

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, with Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff admitting he got bitcoin wrong ten years ago and warned a coming dollar “crisis" could propel crypto higher. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $124,000 this month before crypto market crash fears sent it sharply lower—while traders warned they were seeing other “market top” signs. Now, as Elon Musk confirms his “only” crypto, the bitcoin price and crypto market has been primed for $20 million to $28 million of daily buying pressure as part of $84 trillion set to pass from U.S. Baby Boomers to younger heirs by 2045. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "As Baby Boomers, who collectively control more than half of the global wealth, age and begin to pass on their estates, an estimated $84 trillion is expected to change hands in the United States alone by 2045," analysts with crypto friendly Xapo Bank wrote in a report, citing research from Vanguard. “Globally, this figure reaches approximately $10.6 trillion by 2030 in the U.S., $3.5 trillion in Europe, and $2.8 trillion in Asia.” The report pointed to research that showed younger generations are more likely to invest in bitcoin and crypto than older generations. “Numerous surveys measuring crypto adoption across generations find that these younger generations have at least 3x higher adoption or acceptance rates of crypto compared to Baby Boomers,” Charles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, wrote in 2023. Xapo researchers went on to predict the so-called “great wealth transfer” will lead to the creation of new "bitcoin dynasties," families like the Rockefellers or Rothschilds who build up generational wealth through bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious “A defining outcome of the digital asset revolution is the emergence of ‘bitcoin dynasties’—families and individuals whose multigenerational wealth is rooted in cryptocurrency holdings," the Xapo report authors wrote. "These modern dynasties are drawing comparisons to legacy wealthy families such as the Rockefellers or Rothschilds. Unlike traditional sources of wealth based in land, industrial enterprise, or equities, these dynasties are building and preserving their fortunes on the decentralised rails of blockchain technology." The bitcoin price boom since bitcoin crashed to a recent low of $16,000 in 2023 has been driven by huge adoption of crypto on Wall Street, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and its $83 trillion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto has further supported the market over the last year. On the campaign trail before retaking the White House, Trump pledged to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve similar to the U.S. gold reserve as well as a broader crypto stockpile, ordering their creation in April.

Title: 150 job applications, rescinded offers: Computer science grads are struggling to find work | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/tech/computer-science-graduates-job-hunt-ai
Time Published: 2025-08-28T10:48:56Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Abraham Rubio has wanted to be a software engineer since childhood. On the gaming platform Minecraft, he loved tinkering with “mods,” or alterations to video games created by fans that change elements like a character’s appearance. Eventually, he wasn’t content with just discovering new mods — he wanted to build his own. That early passion led him to study coding at Bloomfield College of Montclair State University in New Jersey, graduating with a degree in computer science and game programming in May. But finding a software development job has proven challenging. Rubio has applied for 20 roles since graduation. He’s yet to receive an offer. “I go on LinkedIn almost every day, just scrolling, trying to see what opportunities are out there,” he said, adding that he hasn’t “really heard anything back from most companies.” For years — as Silicon Valley boomed and all kinds of companies invested in new tech capabilities — computer science degrees, or even certificates from coding bootcamps, seemed like a golden ticket to a sustainable, well-paying job in a fast-paced industry. But in recent years, job openings have become more competitive and harder to come by. Employment for recent graduates in computer science and math jobs has declined by 8% since 2022, Oxford Economics found in a May report. Postings for software development roles on the job site Indeed fell 71% between February 2022 to August 2025, according to Indeed data shared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. With the tech world racing to make artificial intelligence advancements, some new grads say it feels like an especially exciting time to enter the industry. However, AI is also enabling companies to automate some parts of the coding and software development process, reducing the need for human workers, especially in entry-level roles. While tech giants’ valuations continue to soar, many have undergone multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years as they push to accomplish more work with fewer people, a trend that has only been accelerated by AI. Microsoft, for example, became the second company to reach a $4 trillion valuation last month. That was only weeks after saying it would lay off 9,000 employees in its third round of cuts in recent months. CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of Microsoft’s code was being written by AI. “Tech jobs are good, but I will say, the job market right now makes it seem that it’s almost impossible to get one,” said Julio Rodriguez, who graduated last year from Elms College in Massachusetts. He said it took him more than 150 applications before he got a data engineer job earlier this summer. “And then when you get one, you’re also scared of the many layoffs that many companies are having,” he added. CNN spoke with half a dozen job seekers about how they’re navigating the job market, educators training the industry’s next generation of engineers as well as current coders and tech leaders about whether computer science degrees could become obsolete. Nick Vinokour had a dream job lined up after he graduated in December from the University of Michigan with a computer science degree — he had been hired as a strategic projects lead at data labeling startup Scale AI. He was set to start in August. “I was super excited, it was a great opportunity,” Vinokour said. But after Meta invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI in June, acquiring its CEO, Vinokour got an email saying his offer was being rescinded amid a corporate restructuring. Now, he’s still on the hunt for a job. While Vinokour largely believes the state of the economy and stiff competition among recent computer science graduates are to blame for the tough job market, the role of AI has certainly crossed his mind. AI coding tools such as Microsoft’s Copilot and Anysphere’s Cursor are like “a big tidal wave that’s looming to change what the role of a junior engineer is,” he said. (A Scale spokesperson acknowledged that some employees were laid off or had offers rescinded in July, but said Scale is now aggressively hiring for positions across the company.) Some recent computer science grads have turned to TikTok to share frustrations around the current tech job market. A TikTok user named Lili, who goes by @queenofslack on the app, posted a video last month discouraging other students from studying computer science due to her own difficult job hunt. “I think the investment, the difficulty of (computer science) is not worth the instability of the job,” she said. “If you’re really just being motivated by a paycheck and by a cushy job, I can’t say that I would recommend.” Of the more than 250 comments on the video, dozens were from fellow computer science graduates or students expressing similar concerns about their career path. College graduates, broadly, are struggling. A May report from Oxford Economics found that the unemployment rate for recent grads is now greater than the national average. But for job seekers in tech, the data is especially troubling. The New York Fed now pegs the unemployment rate for recent computer science and computer engineering graduates (6.1% and 7.5%, respectively) higher than that for people who studied art history (3%), English (4.9%) and performing arts (2.7%). Recent grads told CNN that they don’t think AI will do away with software engineering jobs entirely. As Brianne Ford, who graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz in May, put it: “Code always needs maintaining.” But there are fears that the technology will usurp opportunities for people looking to break into the field. For entry-level jobs, “they want us to have tons of internships or tons of projects and when you’re in school, you don’t really get as much of a chance,” Ford said. “Me, personally, I worked as a resident advisor to help pay for school.” Vinokour said job seekers his age are in a “pickle” — wanting to take part in the AI boom, but competing against more experienced developers for jobs, especially as some companies slow down or change their hiring plans. “It’s this very weird middle ground that’s exciting because (the industry is) on the precipice of this insane technology. But … it’s harder for a junior engineer to be hired,” Vinokour said. Or as Rubio puts it: “It feels like I’m competing with AI to just try to get my foot in the door.” Some are now reconsidering whether software engineering is truly a viable career path. “I’m pretty pessimistic right now,” said Danny Stalmakov, a Germany-based software developer who graduated with his master’s degree in computer science in 2022. Stalmakov, who said he’s submitted hundreds of applications over six months, has been told by recruiters that there are simply too many applicants for each role. But he also sees the benefit of AI, which now handles 80% of his development work. “While the productivity boost is incredible, it’s also concerning — companies that used to need five developers might only need three now,” he said. “The AI impact on coding made me genuinely unsure about my future in software development, and I really don’t know what my next move will be if the market stays like this,” Stalmakov added. Educators teaching coding and computer science are having to pivot their curriculum to prepare students for a rapidly evolving job market. Magdalena Balazinska, director of the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, said the hiring slowdown is not just because AI is taking coding work. Tech companies are also right-sizing after a Covid-era hiring spree and need to spend wisely amid multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure investments. Balazinska said it’s not all doom and gloom — more than half of the school’s approximately 675 graduates from the 2024-25 school year have already found full-time jobs at companies including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google. Nonetheless, the school is evolving for the AI era, she said. It’s rolling out a new “AI-assisted software development” course this fall, where students will learn about modern software engineering practices and the role of AI as a tool for that work. Some advanced classes will also allow students to use generative AI, “which is enabling faculty members to raise the level of difficulty and complexity of the projects,” Balazinska said. But introductory courses will still prohibit using AI for classwork — so students learn the basics without relying too much on the technology. “Our philosophy has always been that computer science is a field that advances faster than any other field, so preparing students to advance with the field is the most important thing we can do,” Balazinska said. “There will be jobs for those who learn the latest advances in computing and those with excellent skills and knowledge,” she said. It’s not just universities that are changing their approach. Coding bootcamps — specialized schools often catering to career switchers or students looking to pursue careers in tech without a four-year degree — have adapted, too. The idea of landing a lucrative six-figure salary without a traditional degree, combined with an increased hiring demand from the tech industry, led to a boom in enrollment at these bootcamps throughout the 2010s. But Daniele Grassi, CEO of tech bootcamp General Assembly, said he’s noticed a shift over the past couple of years in the types of customers coming to his school. While General Assembly primarily attracted aspiring software engineers for much of its 14-year existence, the school is now also garnering interest from C-level executives, human resource managers and sales professionals interested in developing their AI skills. As a result, General Assembly has begun creating programs specifically designed to help workers across all tiers of a company —from entry level to the board of directors, whether the roles are technical or not — gain new AI skills, according to Grassi. “Six months ago, or nine months ago … we realized that every role is disrupted,” Grassi told CNN. General Assembly has incorporated AI skills teachings into its programming across disciplines, said Jeffrey Bergin, the school’s chief learning officer, so that everything it offers “now has an AI element.” The school offers courses in data analytics, user experience design, data science and information technology in addition to software engineering. Bergin said the school wants “to make sure folks have what they need, both in being able to apply those skills and to take those skills into job interviews and into employers, and have those really resonate.” Tech leaders say they’ll still need young people with computer science degrees, even if there are fewer jobs to go around. “The thing people study is computer science, which is a lot more than code. It’s understanding how these systems work,” Deepak Singh, vice president of developer agents and experiences at Amazon Web Services, told CNN. “The critical thinking part doesn’t change. You still need to be able to think, you need to be creative. I actually think it becomes more important because you have more time” to be creative with AI doing the grunt work. Still, that may be cold comfort to new grads, given Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s recent warning that the company will need fewer human workers in the future as AI takes on more tasks. Beyond big tech, many AI startups are also focused on growing with the smallest teams possible. “The AI boom isn’t following the patterns of past tech cycles,” Kyle Holm, vice president of the compensation advisory group at consulting firm Sequoia, wrote in a blog post last month. “The traditional model of high-growth companies expanding headcount, investing in people teams, and broadly distributing equity isn’t playing out the same way this time.” David Barajas, who has been working as a full-time software engineer for more than a decade, said he would feel “intimidated” by the rise of AI tools in coding if he were a junior engineer. But overall, he’s of the mindset that AI will change the job rather than wipe it out completely — as long as aspiring engineers embrace it, that is. “AI won’t replace you as an engineer,” Barajas said. “An engineer with AI will replace you as an engineer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Following Perfect Dark reboot's cancellation Tomb Raider developers Crystal Dynamics have laid off an unspecified number of staff, their second round of jobs cuts this year. The studio say that the future of the Tomb Raider series won't be affected by this latest taking away of folks' livelihoods. The news comes not too long after the Perfect Dark reboot Crystal Dynamics were working alongside The Initiative was cancelled amid Microsoft's mass cuts in July. The Initiative were shut down as part of that culling. Crystal Dynamics announced these layoffs via LinkedIn post, which neglected to mention exactly how many staff had been let go. "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," they wrote. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition." Crystal Dynamics added that the future of Tomb Raider is "unaffected" by these job cuts. There's currently a new Tomb Raider in the works, and it's set to be published by Amazon. Among the former Crystal Dynamics staff who've shared that they're among those laid off are senior animator Jaron Gittleman and senior designer Matthew Angus. "Well it finally happened," Gittleman wrote on LinkedIn. "After nearly 8 long years I've been laid off from Crystal Dynamics. It's been a helluva run. From Avengers to Tomb Raider to Perfect Dark it has been a journey of a ton of growth. I learned so much and worked with some of the best. I'll miss them dearly." Best of luck to all affected.

Title: Did Nvidia Just Pop an AI Bubble? Here’s What the Market Says

Lukewarm second quarter results from AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) Wednesday have Wall Street bros and the analysts that love them catching all kinds of feelings. Long a bellwether for how the market views AI in general, the largest company in the world carries enough weight in its $1 trillion valuation to move entire indexes, let alone the tech sector. That was especially the case over the last two weeks, when handwringing over what Nvidia would say in its second quarter results on Aug. 27 reached a fever pitch. The TLDR take on what all that was and why it matters? Numbers that showed strong growth from Nvidia were good for AI’s continued bull run; weak numbers would mean that the casino-level spending on AI is finally showing signs of a slowdown. With investors like the U.S. government and Meta, Google, and the private market plowing billions into AI and its tools, it’s always wise to pause for a minute and see what the short-term projections may be for such a hot sector. Well, as is usually the case with analyzing Wall Street, that really depends on who you ask. Overall, Nvidia managed to surpass market consensus, with reported Q2 sales of $46.74 billion, up 56% from a year ago, a number that eked past the market’s projected consensus of $46.23 billion. Of that number, roughly $41.1 billion was from the companyâs data centers business, which missed its expected target of $41.29 billion. For some tech sector watchers, that disparity (while considered relatively minor in other businesses) was enough to raise alarm bells that a spending Ice Age could be drawing nigh. â[Data center operator spending] could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,â Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne wrote in a note to investors. To others, however, Nvidia’s results were actually a reassuring sign that AI spending and the investors, banks, and VCs funding it have very little to fear from these particular results. “I don’t care about the seemingly sky-high market capitalization that these stocks have. I’m simply trying to put a valuation on a company that makes what you need to become one of the serious players in AI,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said after parsing earnings. “I learned not to question Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Meta or even Tesla â the big customers â a long time ago. They know more than I do â¦ I’m just grateful they let me along for the ride,” Cramer added. Of course, debate about the bubble wasted no time flourishing across social media Wednesday, with boosters and doubters posting everything from super-long treatises to hot take memes on how close to calamity or calm we are now. just listened to two moms at the playground saying they want to look into starting an âai dentistryâ practice. guys itâs a bubble itâs a bubble pic.twitter.com/oAEbqjddrc — bwabbage (@bwabbage) August 27, 2025 Is it good at NVIDIA missed data center revenue estimates two quarters running? They were estimated at $41.3bn and hit $41.09bn, were estimated at $39.3bn last quarter and hit $39.1bn. Nobody wanted to talk about this last quarter, wonder if they’ll pretend again this one [image or embed] â Ed Zitron (@edzitron.com) August 27, 2025 at 4:32 PM Nvidia delivered more revenue than expected over the recent three-month period ending in July, the company said on Wednesday, defying concern among some prominent figures about a possible bubble in the AI industry. https://t.co/yuXPMcqSMY — ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2025 It’s probably best to hedge your bets on AI as a never-ending juggernaut of growth. With data center and growths numbers like the ones posted Wednesday, the outlook surrounding Nvidiaâs earnings has heightened fears that the current surge in investment in artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be unsustainable in the long run. You can now expect a growing chorus of analysts to question whether valuations are justified by actual revenue potential, especially amid broader economic uncertainties. Nvidia’s outlook for its business in China was also a key part of its Q2 guidance and highlighted two potentially major hurdles to growth: Disappointing numbers reported from that region, and a continuing uncertainty on what it might expect from American domestic policies. Specifically worrisome is that, despite the Trump administration recently easing restrictions on exports of certain AI chips to Beijing, this policy shift has yet to produce a meaningful recovery in Nvidiaâs revenue from the region. The lingering difficulties in the Chinese market also continue to cast a shadow over the companyâs growth prospects, highlighting how geopolitical tensions remain a significant headwind for the semiconductor giant. artificial intellienceemerging technologiesNvidia Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Check out our Live Bitcoin Hyper Updates for August 28, 2025! In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack! Disclaimer: No crypto investment comes without risk. Our content is for informational purposes, not financial advice. We may earn affiliate commissions at no extra cost to you. HOW TO BUY $HYPER Bitcoin’s sharp jump from around $108K to above $113K in just three days is a massive show of strength by the OG crypto, signaling that it wants to extend its bull run. The token has reclaimed the 100 EMA on the daily chart. This is significant because the last time $BTC interacted with this moving average, it went on to hit new all-time highs. Even better, there’s no shortage of confluence. From the current level acting as a key support zone to the token rejecting the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on the weekly chart, all signs point toward a fresh leg up for Bitcoin. That said, for $BTC to fully shake off its temporary downward momentum, it needs to break and hold above $117,390, aka the most recent swing high. If it does, Bitcoin could be nicely set up for a potential run to new ATHs, representing at least a 10% gain from current levels. August 28, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s slowing down, you say? Sure, the price has cooled after record highs, but the market is buzzing for a different reason. The spotlight is now on Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the viral new Layer-2 that just smashed through $12.5M in the presale. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, it’s designed to fix Bitcoin’s biggest problems: sluggish speeds, high fees, and zero smart contract support. Think instant payments, cheap transactions, and dApps running on Bitcoin’s security. That’s why investors looking for the next crypto to explode are piling in. With $HYPER priced at just $0.012815 and featured in Best Wallet’s ‘Upcoming Tokens,’ it’s quickly being called one of the best crypto presales of 2025. If Bitcoin Hyper succeeds, it won’t just make Bitcoin faster – it could make it the backbone of Web3. Grab your $HYPER now before the next stage kicks in. You can use our guide to learn how to buy $HYPER. August 28, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Google has announced on LinkedIn that there’s a new Layer 1 in the works designed to be “neutral ground” for competing payment platforms. The Google Cloud Universal Ledger will support Python-based smart contracts. Rich Widmann, head of Web3 strategy at Google, has teased that more information on the technical details will be available in the coming months. Google isn’t the only developer building an exciting new Layer 1 product. Stripe and Circle are also forging ahead with new Layer 1 services designed to facilitate payment processing. The increased interest in Layer 1 technologies highlights how the Bitcoin network has fallen seriously behind in terms of technical innovation, but one project seeks to change that: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). $HYPER is redefining how we think about Bitcoin by adding a Layer 2 solution based on Solana on top of the Layer 1. It’ll bring smart contract support to the Bitcoin network, opening the way for DeFi apps, NFT trades, and crypto swaps – all with the value of $BTC. We’ve already seen serious interest in the $HYPER project, as it’s just pushed through the $12.5M mark in presales. When you learn what Bitcoin Hyper is doing for the Bitcoin network’s ability to process transactions quicker (as well as lowering fees), you’ll see why it’s a necessary evolution for $BTC. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale at just $0.012815 before the next price increase. August 28, 2025 • 13:00 UTC XRP broke $3 this week, backed by record institutional flows and resilient spot support. A huge surge in CME futures open interest signals heavy institutional bets, while technical analysts are eyeing Fibonacci extensions. They’re pointing to potential long-term targets of $8, $13, and even $27. Meanwhile, the long-running SEC case against Ripple is reportedly nearing settlement at $125 M, clearing the path for regulatory clarity and even a future XRP ETF. If the sentiment holds, XRP could become the spark for a wider altcoin rally, with smart capital rotating into early-stage projects. Among those aligned with XRP’s infrastructure-driven growth is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). The project aims to bring speed and programmability to the Bitcoin blockchain. So it comes as no surprise that the $HYPER presale has already smashed through $12.5M and it is one of the best new cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. Visit the official website to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper. August 28, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Crafting a crypto portfolio for a potential bull run can undoubtedly be exciting. But at the same time, it’s no easy task, with hundreds of altcoins on the market, and each promising life-changing returns. To help you steer the boat with both speed and security (well, as ‘safe’ as crypto can be), we turned to ChatGPT and asked it to identify a low-cap, hype-driven, utility-backed project that could give your portfolio the much-needed degen edge. The result? ChatGPT picked Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as the best crypto to invest in right now. So, what’s $HYPER? Simply put, it’s a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin aiming to bring Solana-like lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to the otherwise slow and non-programmable Bitcoin blockchain. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. August 28, 2025 • 11:00 UTC If we needed more proof that Bitcoin is now mainstream, here it is. A Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm filed a registration statement with the SEC this Tuesday. The healthcare provider, KindlyMD, is launching a $5B at-the-market equity raise program to build its Bitcoin treasury. According to the filing, the company’s Treasury Reserve Policy views Bitcoin as the primary reserve asset on an ongoing basis. KindlyMD also plans to continue its $BTC accumulation ‘without setting a specific target to be held.’ In a move mirroring the broader market and similar institutional-level shifts, the filing mentions the potential development of ‘Bitcoin companies’ in the finance, advisory, and media sectors. As more institutions shift to Bitcoin and fuel positive market sentiment, adjacent crypto projects attract more retail investors looking to diversify. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the latest example with a booming presale nearing $12.5M. This project is building a unique Layer-2 for Bitcoin that promises to lower network congestion, increase throughput, and bring Solana-style smart contracts to $BTC holders. See our $HYPER price prediction for more project details. August 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The Philippines could be the first country in the world to put its national budget on a blockchain if the proposal of one of its senators pushes through. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV shared this suggestion during yesterday’s session at the Manila Tech Summit. While no concrete plans have been made to implement this, having a country’s budget on-chain could provide transparency and combat corruption, as it ensures records are validated, immutable, and verifiable. The move could also increase the adoption of blockchain technology among citizens, as it would encourage them to interact with the tech to see how their government is spending their hard-earned tax money. Moreover, governments could eventually switch to using blockchain tech for payments (e.g., taxes), similar to how some tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will be used to pay for gas fees and other transaction fees within their respective ecosystems. Check out our ‘What Is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide to learn more! August 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock is now the biggest Bitcoin custodian after its IBIT spot ETF holdings hit 745,357 $BTC. By comparison, Coinbase’s holdings sit at 706,150 $BTC and Binance’s at 584,557 $BTC, according to recent onchain figures. The signal is clear: the flow of money is shifting; institutions are moving away from exchanges to secure their holdings through regulated ETFs. While this means potentially tighter liquidity, the bigger picture entails wider, easier Bitcoin exposure for retail – especially with hedge and pensions funds turning their attention to crypto. The crypto market is preparing for growing Bitcoin network activity and demand as $BTC’s daily trading volume is still in the green. Solutions like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new blockchain solution to upscale Bitcoin, are getting a lot of retail attention right now. With nearly $12.5M raised on presale so far and over 44,000 transactions recorded, the Hyper presale is one of the most popular crypto projects right now.

Title: Tesseract and the Future of Yield

Time Published: 2025-08-28T09:53:58Z
Full Content:
For James Harris, the newly appointed Group CEO of Tesseract, taking the helm of the Helsinki-based digital asset lender is both a culmination of years of leadership in financial technology and the beginning of a bold new chapter. “Joining Tesseract was both a natural progression and a step up,” Harris reflects. “At CoinDesk Data and Zodia Custody, I helped shape strategy and led commercial growth, but I wasn’t the final decision-maker. Having run smaller businesses in the past, I knew I was ready for the challenge of stepping into the CEO role and taking full accountability.” The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more That accountability now extends across Tesseract’s $500m in assets under management and over $1bn in originated loans. Harris inherits a company with solid foundations, a reputation for reliable yield services, a team with deep institutional experience, and strong partnerships, including with Bitstamp (now part of Robinhood). Yet, as he sees it, the company remains underappreciated in a crowded marketplace. “Tesseract has a product that works, a talented team, and a track record,” he says. “But it hasn’t yet achieved the scale or visibility it deserves. Helping it fulfils that potential and become a category-defining company in crypto yield is exactly the kind of challenge that energises me at this point in my career.” At the heart of Harris’s vision is a deceptively simple ambition: make earning yield on digital assets as safe, seamless, and predictable as holding a government bond. “Whether you’re an exchange offering Earn products to your users, or a corporate treasury looking to deploy assets responsibly, you should be able to plug into Tesseract and access curated, institutional-grade yield strategies without needing to navigate DeFi, counterparties, custody, or regulation yourself,” Harris explains. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. This philosophy, what he calls “Yield as Infrastructure” underpins Tesseract’s model. The company provides a modular, API-driven platform that connects client capital to carefully managed opportunities across CeFi and DeFi. The risk, regulatory, and operational burdens are absorbed by Tesseract, freeing partners to focus on growth. “Our edge lies in that full-stack approach,” Harris says. “Most firms either focus on custody, trading, or asset management. We sit across all three, which gives us a better vantage point on risk and access. And importantly, we’re in the process of obtaining European regulatory authorisation, including specific permissions to deploy assets into DeFi something most competitors simply can’t do.” With a foundation in place, Harris is already looking two to three years ahead. “We can significantly grow AUM by expanding distribution and broadening our product shelf,” he says. Planned innovations include risk-banded yield strategies, tokenised vaults, and hybrid yield-powered asset management products tailored for fintech’s, family offices, and institutions. The company is also positioning itself as a bridge for traditional financial institutions tentatively entering the digital asset world. “There’s a huge opportunity in helping large TradFi firms dip their toes into on-chain yield in a way that’s measurable and compliant,” Harris notes. “We want to make crypto yield predictable, trusted and maybe even a little bit boring.” The timing appears right. Institutional adoption of digital assets is gathering momentum, driven by three converging forces: clearer regulation, macroeconomic pressure, and improved infrastructure. “In the US, initiatives like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts are landmark moments. In Europe, MiCA is now live. That level of clarity would have been aspirational just two years ago,” Harris argues. “When firms like BlackRock are tokenising treasuries and building on public blockchains, it’s a strong signal the tide has turned.” Meanwhile, with rate cuts looming and real yields under pressure, institutional investors are looking elsewhere for returns. Crypto-native strategies offering 5–15% through staking or protocol-based lending are increasingly difficult to ignore. “Many still assume crypto yield is either too risky or unregulated,” Harris admits. “That’s a misconception. There’s a big difference between chasing unsustainable APYs and allocating to risk-managed, on-chain strategies run by professionals with controls and accountability. The gap in understanding is narrowing, but we need to keep building trust.” To that end, Tesseract has embedded compliance, credit, and liquidity oversight into every layer of its stack. Its modular infrastructure is designed to integrate seamlessly into institutional workflows, with APIs, segregated wallets, and granular reporting. If trust is the end goal, regulation is the foundation. For Harris, Europe’s MiCA framework is both a challenge and an opportunity. “Regulation is the defining lens for any serious crypto business,” he says. “MiCA raised the bar, but it also gave institutions the clarity they’ve been waiting for. We’ve shaped our strategy around operating in this arena and expect to be fully MiCA-compliant ahead of year-end.” This requires heavy investment in compliance infrastructure and audit-ready processes, but Harris sees the payoff as significant. “Smaller players may struggle with the cost and complexity. For us, compliance becomes a competitive advantage, it attracts capital and legitimises what we do.” A particular area of focus is stablecoins, which power around 70% of DeFi yield flows. “Stablecoins are central to our strategy,” Harris explains. “We treat them like any other yield-bearing instrument: analysing issuer risk, regulatory status, reserves, and redemption mechanics. Algorithmic stablecoins we mostly avoid; fiat-backed types like USDC remain the core.” MiCA will tighten rules around stablecoins, including capping their circulation in some cases, but Harris views this as positive. “Our B2B clients want yield, but they need confidence. By combining stablecoin yields with real-world assets, staking, and protocol lending, we can offer diversified, risk-adjusted solutions.” Looking further ahead, Harris believes the most enduring innovations in decentralised finance will centre around real-world integration and institutional adoption. “Three developments stand out,” he says. “First, real-world asset tokenisation—on-chain treasuries, bonds, and money market funds will unlock over $1tn in flows by 2030. Second, cross-chain yield infrastructure like EigenLayer reduces fragmentation and expands opportunity. Third, compliant hybrids that blend DeFi yield with institutional-grade wrappers will dominate.” Harris is confident that DeFi and traditional finance are on a path of convergence. “TradFi is adopting blockchain for efficiency, while DeFi is adapting to regulatory and institutional requirements. In five years, yield products will likely look like hybrids: tokenised treasuries earning DeFi-based yield, wrapped in compliant structures and integrated directly into banks and fintechs.” Will the future be decentralised or institution-led? Harris sees a pragmatic outcome. “In terms of scale, institutions will dominate they have the capital, compliance engines, and distribution. But the energy and innovation still comes from the edges. Our job is to capture the best of both worlds and deliver compliant, risk-adjusted returns.” For all the talk of 2030, Harris is keenly focused on the next year. Milestones ahead include: “We’re not trying to do everything,” Harris stresses. “We’re focused on a few critical things we can do exceptionally well, and by doing so, build a durable platform for long-term growth.” As for the biggest misconception he’d like to put to rest. “That digital asset yields are inherently reckless,” he says firmly. “The reality is they can be responsibly managed, risk-adjusted, and institutionally scalable. That’s the future we’re building at Tesseract.”

Title: BlackRock Poised to Become Top $BTC and $ETH Custodian as Bitcoin Hyper Presale Targets $12.5M

BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) could soon position it as the top custodian of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. The company is nipping at the heels of Binance, which currently holds the number one spot. Prices of these coins could continue to rise as more ETFs and institutional investors stockpile them. This could see Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) get a boost from investors looking to take advantage of the speed and low transaction costs of its planned Bitcoin Layer 2. Over the past several months, BlackRock’s $BTC and $ETH ETFs have massively increased their coins in custody. Based on Arkham data, its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF’s holdings grew from only 1.1M $ETH in January to 3.6M $ETH today. Meanwhile, it expanded its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF’s $BTC holdings from 228K at the start of the year to its present 745.5K. This rapid accumulation of the top two coins has brought BlackRock’s ETFs much closer to the current leaders Binance (626.2K $BTC, 4.3M $ETH) and Coinbase (977.2K $BTC, 5.1M $ETH). In addition, continued whale buys of these cryptocurrencies continue to reduce their liquid supply, which helps push their prices higher. Higher prices, naturally, increase the attractiveness of the coins, so more traders buy or hold them. This also shines a light on projects that build upon their respective chains, especially if they make transactions cheaper or expand a coin’s utility. As the world’s top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to attract investors of all sizes. However, it’s bogged down by fundamental issues such as slow transactions, which contribute to high fees. Also, $BTC has limited applications since it can’t be used for staking or interacting with dApps. Fixing this isn’t a simple matter of rewriting Bitcoin’s underlying code, as that would weaken its security. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. This project aims to create a Bitcoin Layer 2, which should bring Solana-level speeds, low transaction costs, and expanded utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Think of it as a fast lane to Bitcoin’s heavily congested Layer 1. When launched, you’ll be able to send your $BTC to the L2 via a Canonical Bridge. This creates a wrapped $BTC of the same value on the L2. You can then use this for things $BTC couldn’t do before, like trading and staking. This high-speed environment is powered by a Solana Virtual Machine, which makes transactions significantly faster and cheaper than on the L1. To ensure that the actual amount and value of your $BTC is up to date, the L2 regularly synchronizes with the L1. Then, if you want to bring your coin back to the base layer, simply withdraw it, and it will be sent to your Bitcoin wallet address. Bitcoin Hyper has the potential to change the Bitcoin ecosystem for the better, which has seen it raise nearly $12.5M to date and become one of this year’s best presales to invest in. To get your $HYPER tokens, go to the official presale website or buy them via the Best Wallet app. Each one only costs $0.012815, making it a cheap and potentially profitable way to invest in the future of Bitcoin. Staking is another option if you want to earn passive income from your $HYPER tokens. When you do, you’ll enjoy rewards at 89% p.a. If you’re more of a long-term investor, Bitcoin Hyper’s promise as a Layer 2 could potentially result in healthy gains. Based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, it could be worth as much as $1.50 by 2030 when the project fully matures. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Growing interest from institutions like BlackRock is a boon for top cryptocurrencies like $BTC and $ETH. In effect, they reduce the number of coins circulating in the market, making them scarcer and therefore more expensive. The rapid accumulation of these coins also attracts attention to projects that build upon the base blockchains. A good example is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has raised nearly $12.5M to date for its planned Bitcoin Layer 2. Disclaimer: Do your own research. This is not investment advice.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs outpace Bitcoin counterparts with $307M in Inflows

Time Published: 2025-08-28T09:04:50Z

US spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $307 million in net inflows on Wednesday, extending their lead over spot bitcoin ETFs, according to SoSoValue data. BlackRock’s ETHA drew the largest single-day inflow at $262.6 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $20.5 million. Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and ETHE, along with VanEck’s ETHV, also reported fresh inflows. By contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $81.3 million in inflows, marking a third consecutive day of positive flows but remaining well below Ethereum’s tally. Bitcoin rose 2% over the past 24 hours to $113,307 as of 3:10 a.m. ET Thursday, CoinGlass data showed. Ethereum was little changed, inching up 0.08% to $4,581. Ether has nonetheless staged a stronger recovery this week, climbing 5% from its Tuesday low, compared with bitcoin’s 2.8% gain over the same period. Since August 21, spot Ether ETFs have seen $1.83 billion in inflows, compared with just $171 million for spot bitcoin ETFs, data showed. Ethereum investor and educator Anthony Sassano described the trend as “brutal,” highlighting the scale of the shift. NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci noted that spot Ether ETFs are now nearing $10 billion in inflows since early July. Spot Ether ETFs, which have been trading for 13 months, have drawn $13.6 billion in cumulative inflows. Most of that activity has come in recent months. Spot bitcoin ETFs have a longer track record, with 20 months of trading and $54 billion in aggregate inflows. Momentum has recently tilted toward Ethereum, a trend some market participants linked to the passing of the GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation in July. With Ethereum holding the largest market share of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets, VanEck chief executive Jan van Eck called it “very much what I call the Wall Street token” in an interview with Fox Business this week. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that investment advisers account for $1.3 billion in exposure to Ether ETFs, citing SEC filings. Goldman Sachs was identified as the largest single holder, with $712 million in exposure.

Tomb Raider remains unaffected. Crystal Dynamics has announced the "difficult decision" to lay off more staff, citing "evolving business conditions". It added the decision was not made lightly, but was necessary to "ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market". In a post shared on LinkedIn, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition". It went on to additionally thank the rest of its team, as well as its community and partners for the "continued support" as the studio builds a "creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together". The next entry in the Tomb Raider series - which is being developed in collaboration with Amazon - is not affected by these most recent layoffs at Crystal Dynamics. This week's layoffs follow the cancellation of Perfect Dark earlier this year by Microsoft. While the reboot was being helmed by The Initiative, Crystal Dynamics was supporting the project. Well this is it. I was let go from Crystal Dynamics as Perfect Dark was cancelled. I am now out of a job. I genuinely dont know what to do at this moment but to frantically apply for as many jobs that are applicable. If anyone needs a Senior Environment Artist of 10+ years, please let me know. The studio previously laid off 17 staff members in March of this year. At this time, Crystal Dynamics said this was "necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success", and was "not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected". This is a news-in-brief story. This is part of our vision to bring you all the big news as part of a daily live report.

Title: Steel tycoon Gupta's troubles deepen amid Australian probe

Australia's markets watchdog is said to have taken possession of a mobile phone belonging to Sanjeev Gupta as part of a deepening investigation into his operations, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Thursday 28 August 2025 09:46, UK Sanjeev Gupta, the metals tycoon whose main British business was forced into compulsory liquidation last week, is facing a deepening probe by Australian regulators into his operations in the country. Sky News has learnt that officials from the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) last week served Mr Gupta's Liberty Steel group with a new demand for information about its activities. Sources said the regulator had also taken possession of a mobile phone belonging to Mr Gupta as part of the probe. Money latest: Airline makes plus-sized travellers buy two seats One insider said that other senior executives at the company may also have had electronic devices confiscated, although the accuracy of this claim could not be verified on Thursday morning. Both ASIC and a spokesman for Mr Gupta's GFG conglomerate refused to comment on the suggestion that a search warrant had been produced by the watchdog. ASIC's deepening investigation comes a month after it said that three of GFG Alliance's companies had been ordered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales to lodge outstanding annual reports with it. City veteran Kheraj in contention to chair banking giant HSBC Bank shares take fright as budget tax hike is floated Money blog: 'I'm a landlord... I also live at home with mum and dad' - The Gen Z landlords flipping the narrative It is the latest headache to hit Mr Gupta, whose companies remain under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK. Last week, the Official Receiver took control of Speciality Steels UK following a winding-up petition from creditors led by Greensill Capital, the collapsed finance firm. Mr Gupta remains intent on buying SSUK back, and has assembled financing from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, Sky News revealed last week. SSUK employs nearly 1,500 people at steel plants in South Yorkshire, and makes highly engineered steel products for use in sectors such as aerospace, automotive and oil and gas. "[Gupta Family Group] will now continue to advance its bid for the business in collaboration with prospective debt and equity partners and will present its plan to the official receiver," Jeffrey Kabel, chief transformation officer, at Liberty Steel, said after SSUK's collapse. "GFG continues to believe it has the ideas, management expertise and commitment to lead SSUK into the future and attract major investment." "The plan that GFG presented to the court would have secured new investment in the UK steel industry, protecting jobs and establishing a sustainable operational platform under a new governance structure with independent oversight," Mr Kabel added. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free "Instead, liquidation will now impose prolonged uncertainty and significant costs on UK taxpayers for settlements and related expenses, despite the availability of a commercial solution." Mr Gupta wants to hand control of SSUK to his family in a bid to alleviate concerns about his influence. One source close to the situation claimed that the ownership structure devised by Mr Gupta would be independent, ring-fenced from him and have "robust standards of governance". Behind Tata Steel and British Steel, SSUK is the third-largest steel producer in the country. Other parts of Mr Gupta's empire have been showing signs of financial stress for years. Mr Gupta is said to have explored whether he could persuade the government to step in and support SSUK using the legislation enacted to take control of British Steel's operations. His overtures were dismissed by Whitehall officials. He had previously sought government aid during the pandemic but that plea was also rejected by ministers.

Title: Media & Marketing Financials – August 2025

by Mathew Broughton on 28th Aug 2025 in News With Autumn and ATS London on the horizon, ExchangeWire research lead Mat Broughton takes stock (if you'll pardon the pun) of company financials across the media and marketing ecosystem. A solid quarter overall for our monitored advertising technology companies, however subsequent volatility suggests headwinds for the remainder of the year. As we track to the start of the calendar month, the chart above does not account for the post-results hit to The Trade Desk, which took a near 40% thumping in terms of its share price off of a deceleration in growth. Despite reaping recent rewards with its continued championing of the open web, investors panicked over competition from the likes of Amazon. As summarised by Madison & Wall, “Long-term optimism around the opportunity from the open web for The Trade Desk continues to seem unfounded to us[...] As well uncertainties abound around the mix of revenue trends for the company from data vs. technology fees.” Ouch. This had a knock-on effect on the rest of the sector, with Zeta, MNTN, Magnite, PubMatic and Viant, all seeing share price dips despite solid earnings. Simultaneously, we saw AppLovin continue its meteoric rise, despite ongoing scrutiny as to its practices. If The Trade Desk gets thumped for calling Amazon a potential partner, why does AppLovin avoid the hammer for wholly partnering with Meta whilst simultaneously acting as a parasite? This is all not to forget the latest flop in the flip-flop-flip-flop saga of Google deprecating third-party cookies across its Chrome browser, now deciding that users will no longer be offered the choice to use, or not use, the cookie. Where one door of uncertainty closes, another opens… The big tech and social platforms recorded astounding revenue growth across the board, particularly considering the age of some of these firms. Notably, Meta, Reddit, and Apple all exceeded earnings expectations despite Trump's tariffs and economic slowdown. Twas much of the same for Google parent Alphabet, as its third-party network business continues to stagnate, whilst YouTube goes gangbusters, achieving double-digit growth to reach USD$9.8bn (£7.2bn). Search revenue also continues to climb, bouldering 12% upwards to over USD$54bn (£39.9bn). Google claims that its AI search results monetise at the same rate as traditional search ads, despite these decimating publisher traffic, indicating these generate far fewer clicks, and comparatively showing far fewer ads within its AI Mode. I asked Google AI Mode to clarify:Righto. A highly tumultuous time across the agency landscape, with the public-listed holding groups exposed to the joint gales of AI and upstart independents. In recent months, we’ve seen a frankly aggressive period of client switching, with massive brand accounts switching hands nigh-on every week. Through this turbulence, Omnicom and IPG had a stable quarter ahead of the closure of their blockbuster merger. Further consolidation was seemingly on the cards, with Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4Capital mulling over a merger approach from private equity-backed MSQ Partners, only for the mooted acquirer to come out and say that they had not made an approach, nor would ever do so ever again. Savagery Publicis continues to fly, nabbing accounts aplenty at the expense of its rivals. I’ve used the phrase “mastering the narrative” a lot in recent months regarding Publicis, and they continue to do so, rightfully highlighting that scrutiny will shift onto Omnicom/IPG following the completion of their merger (much to the delight of beleaguered WPP). As industry expert Barry Dudley observed: "having an enemy, a Goliath to your David, is very commonly what drives people, drives businesses. This has been the environment that Publicis has been playing within." A mixed bag among the publisher set, with digital publishers and streaming providers seeing strong gains, whilst traditional linear TV publishers continue to face headwinds. Despite market challenges, UK publishers showed strong momentum, whilst audience targeting, first-party data strategies, and AI integration, all dominated earnings presentations. Consolidation has cooled in the segment, barring the merger between Nextar and Tegna, which seeks to solidify shaky foundations beneath the house of local TV across the US. Despite rampant speculation earlier in the year, gossip has quietened about a potential divestment of ITV Studios from the parent ITV business, however talks may still be ongoing on that front.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Announces Layoffs; New Tomb Raider Game Is Unaffected

A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected. Here's the whole message that was posted on LinkedIn: Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition. To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision. The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was canceled last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft. Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP. In April 2022, we learned that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio announced that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with vague goals to create an interconnected universe that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually air on Prime Video. As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last heard something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: ChatGPT’s Top 4 Cryptos to 100x for 2025

If you were paying attention, you probably know the crypto market is up to something. Rapidly increasing corporate crypto stashes, a slew of pro-crypto policy changes, and the Fed chair hinting at a September rate cut are all massive signs that the next few months could churn out some life-changing returns. But in a market with hundreds of thousands of tokens, how do you identify the best cryptos to buy? Do you just stick to the main ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum? While relatively ‘safe,’ following this approach would probably mean leaving a lot of money on the table. On the other hand, you can’t just ape into random shitcoins either, hoping they skyrocket. That’s too risky and ill-advised. To help you do just that, we turned to ChatGPT, which is arguably the most powerful AI chatbot around right now. Read on as we unpack the AI’s top crypto picks, with detailed explanations on why each of them could be the next crypto to explode. If you’re a Bitcoin believer who would happily purchase every last bit of ‘digital gold’ they could, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) might just be what you’re looking for. Not only is it far cheaper than $BTC, but $HYPER also carries a higher ROI potential, seeing as it’s currently in presale and available at ultra-low prices. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token could surge almost 2,400% by the end of 2025, potentially hitting $0.32. What’s special about $HYPER? It’s building the first-ever Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin aimed at turbocharging the blockchain with Solana-like performance. Thanks to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER will bring lightning-fast speeds, low fees, and cutting-edge Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. And a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge lets you interact with Hyper’s SVM-powered Web3 environment by converting your Layer 1 $BTC into Layer 2 $BTC. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already pulled in over $12.4M from early investors. And right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.012815 apiece. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to join the Bitcoin revolution. Ethereum ($ETH) has been at the center of nearly all crypto chatter in recent days, and for good reason. Institutional players are scooping up ‘digital silver’ at a rapid pace, in some cases even favoring it over Bitcoin. That’s a telling sign the whales know something. Case in point: BlackRock recently dropped a massive $314M on Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street beefed up their $ETH ETF holdings by adding another 160K and 32.5K $ETH, respectively. Even better? If Ethereum retests its all-time high, $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated, igniting a massive short squeeze and fueling a potential parabolic rally. On the technical front, CryptoGoos, a crypto analyst with 121K+ followers on X, pointed out that $ETH has just broken out of a huge consolidation channel on the weekly chart. After a quick retest, the token now looks primed to rally higher. And according to this trading pattern, Ethereum’s next target could be… drumroll… $10K! Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) blends iconic meme coin humor with crypto finance, offering a never-before-seen community for retail investors. As a $WEPE holder, you gain access to a vibrant and tight-knit group of crypto traders, all benefitting from each other’s strategies, insights, alpha buy/sell calls, and, of course, plenty of jokes along the way. After a record-breaking presale performance, where $WEPE gathered over $70M from early investors, the token proved its worth by rising almost 900% during June-July this year. And while $WEPE is admittedly in the red over the past couple of weeks, it’s now flirting with the upper resistance of a major triangle consolidation pattern. A breakout here could slam the gas pedal and send $WEPE soaring, potentially even to new all-time highs, representing a 400% gain from current levels. In addition to strong technicals, the token is also set to benefit from its upcoming Solana launch, which is likely to bring in a fresh wave of investors and hype, further boosting price. Only a meme coin or a full-blown movement? We’ll let you decide. 1 $WEPE on $ETH is currently available at just $0.000067 on DEXs. Ir you want the new $SOL $WEPE, visit the visit Wall Street Pepe’s official website. Chainlink ($LINK) has long been considered one of the best tokens for diversifying crypto portfolios, but recent developments – both fundamental and technical – suggest it’s now ready to take the crypto space by storm. According to CryptoELITES, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst with more than 260K followers on X, $LINK is tantalizingly close to breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. Even better? The upward-sloping trendline of this pattern has acted as strong support for months, confirming this as a rock-solid setup that could deliver in a big way. The expectation? Once $LINK breaks out, ideally with a fat green candle, it could ignite an explosive rally on its way toward $100. That means if you scoop up $LINK now, while it’s trading around $24.16, you could be staring at a chunky 313% return on your investment. And here’s where things get even more exciting: major investment firms are showing interest in launching a spot Chainlink ETF, with Bitwise having filed for one just a few days ago. A spot ETF would legitimize $LINK as an institutional-grade asset, open the floodgates for new capital, and massively increase demand, all of which would be highly bullish for price. We decided to put ChatGPT’s potentially revolutionary research and narrative-building skills to the test by asking it to craft a well-rounded crypto portfolio for 2025.

But the United States’ economic partners, and some of its rivals, are also benefiting from having the unorthodox showman back in the Oval Office. Investors are watching the U.S. stock market with both enthusiasm and trepidation: The S&P 500 is up 15% over the past year, Treasuries have remained relatively steady, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expected to begin a downward trajectory. But overlaying the strong fundamentals are questions: Is the soaring growth of Magnificent Seven stocks overvalued on the unfulfilled promises of AI? Will Trump’s unusual foreign policy materially damage the domestic economy? And where might the true winners of the artificial intelligence race emerge from? Increasingly, investors are answering those questions by diversifying into a key region, says Willem Sels, global chief investment officer for HSBC’s global private bank. That region is China. America continues to prove its economic resilience and earnings deliverables, Sels told Fortune in an exclusive interview, but geopolitical uncertainty is pushing investors toward balancing risk with other regions. Traditionally, the question of political influence over portfolios has centered on emerging markets, said Sels, but over the past few years that has moved into developed markets as well. As such, diversification has become more of a focus—particularly for business owners looking to spread risk between the economy they operate in and the assets used to protect their wealth. “When a client comes in the door … the first discussion is, ‘Please build a global portfolio. Maybe try to have as little as possible in your home country if you already have your business here, because that’s diversification,’” Sels said. “Clearly the debate over the last few months was about, Will there be diversification away from the U.S.? And there are a number of elements to that.” Part of the question is how dominant U.S. Big Tech has become in equity markets, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) providing most of the growth. As such, if these stocks hiccup it can have major ramifications for portfolios. “Clearly you potentially need to do something around that … to diversify,” Sels said. “We highlight things like, make sure that you don’t only have the growth stocks but have some value stocks, do some sector diversification, do some geographical diversification, and so on. “The other thing that triggered that diversification discussion obviously was the rapid policy changes in the U.S., and the growth of the debt pile, which led people to ask the question, ‘Is there a de-dollarization story? And what does that mean in terms of my portfolio and other people’s portfolio?’ What we’ve seen in the data is that there have been two months or so where there were some outflows out of bonds and equity markets, but that has not lasted—to a large extent because policy has become a little bit clearer.” “People are adding a little bit to other regions, adding a little bit to other sectors to be less concentrated in the U.S. market, but they are not fleeing away from it,” Sels continued. “There was enthusiasm for European stocks, but it was very short-lived. The Asian investors, over the last 15 [to] 20 years that I’ve been going there, find it very hard to get excited about Europe.” Part of the problem is that these investors don’t see as many new or emerging companies that could materially change the European economy, and there’s also the issue of brand recognition beyond companies like LVMH and BMW, Sels said. “This is the first time that we’re again seeing flows from Europe into China,” Sels added. “That is to a large extent because of the AI trade that people want to play, and then secondly this concept of anti-involution … with the supply-side reforms which would address the issue of overcapacity, therefore the deflation issue and therefore the earnings growth, because what you have in China is a lot of very competitive companies … therefore they have no pressing power, and therefore earnings growth has been reasonably weak.” China has signaled a shift in priorities to address involution, with the country’s Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission telling President Xi Jinping in a meeting last month that Beijing must “focus on key and difficult issues, regulate enterprises’ disorderly and low-price competition,” and “guide enterprises to improve product quality and promote the orderly exit of outdated production capacity.” Beijing is no stranger to the issue. In 2015 the government launched similar actions to address overcapacity, particularly in key regions like steel and coal, in order to boost corporate profitability. Flash-forward to 2025 and “they’re now addressing that,” Sels said. “Therefore we think that earnings expectations will go up … One of the main obstacles for our clients had been the belief that [Chinese companies are] over-competing, and therefore your earnings are not there, the economic growth is potentially there, but your earnings are not there. “That’s now changing. So we’re seeing flows back and obviously also encouraged by ‘How can I diversify my big U.S. trunk of assets?’” With discussions about diversification out of the U.S. remaining active, China seems to have emerged as the region to balance that risk, Sels said. And Beijing’s typically lower share prices also offer the category of the moment, AI, at a bargain. In a note published last week, HSBC said that within the AI ecosystem, infrastructure stocks are outperforming enablers and adopters—at 22.2% versus 11.3% and 13.5% since July. Indeed, this week Chinese chipmaker Cambricon Technologies briefly became the country’s most expensive stock, surging 10% on Wednesday to 1,465 yuan ($204.62). At the time of writing, the share price has dropped back but is up 112% for the year to date. And while Cambricon exemplifies the more expensive end of the scale, Sels highlights that other equivalents to U.S. stocks can be found at a “30% to 40% discount.” “We’re basically saying, ‘Listen, don’t just look at the chips makers but also look at the guys that build out the infrastructure around it. The guys that build out the energy, the electricity supply around it, the robotics and automation, where it is not just a matter of, we move the data a little bit—this is real, big innovation.’ And so by diversifying throughout the AI ecosystem, I think you address a little bit of the question about valuations.” China’s stock market is soaring: The SSE Composite Index is up 33.4% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is up 14.9%. While the growth in China is marked, HSBC’s research points out U.S. AI-related capital expenditure (driven by the “Big Four” of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, along with Stargate and other private companies) is surpassing that of China’s “Big Four” (Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, as well as telecom services companies) by eight- to 10-fold. Moreover, HSBC’s research adds: “U.S. firms achieve higher returns on AI capex, with cloud platforms generating significantly more revenue than their Chinese counterparts—close to USD $400 billion in the U.S. vs. USD $60 billion in China in 2024, according to Statista.” So while clients may be balancing against overreliance on American companies, Sels said, the upside fundamentals of the U.S. remain strong—enough to take recession off the table. Indeed, while blips in tech stocks recently led to questions over an AI bubble, the HSBC boss remained bullish: “We certainly think that that AI liftoff is structural in nature.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Firms urged to move staff onto workplace pensions ahead of December deadline
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/28/firms-urged-to-move-staff-onto-workplace-pensions-ahead-of-december-deadline/

Businesses planning to move staff on to their existing pension schemes to avoid being captured by the incoming automatic enrolment system are being urged to take action well before the new State-run portal goes live in December. Department of Finance officials have confirmed that auto-enrolment (AE) instructions will be issued in early December, targeting an estimated 800,000 workers in the Republic that are not currently part of a workplace or private pension plan. However, any cases where pension contributions have been made through payroll in the 13 weeks prior to that date will be exempt from the AE regime, which is called My Future Fund, they said. Many companies are known to be planning to move AE-eligible workers into their own existing defined contribution pension plans. “Companies intending to use their existing plan to achieve AE compliance, as many of them are, should get their ducks in a row well before the official January implementation date if they want to get their staff safely embedded with their own plans,” said Shane O’Farrell, director of workplace markets at Irish Life’s employer solutions unit. “Employers should aim to have the first pension contributions for newly enrolled staff by mid-November. This will avoid the risk that employees are enrolled into the State AE model by default, because they lack a history of pension contributions in their current employment.” There has been some concern among businesses that there would be little time to enter and cross-check details of workers being included in the AE scheme, as the online portal is only set to go live in December, according to sources. However, a spokeswoman for the department said that employers “will have a number of weeks” to use the AE portal and put in information, including preferred payment methods, before the official go-live date. “Employers will have a number of weeks to do this before go-live, giving ample time for them to ensure that they are able to meet their legal requirements and avoid the risk of fines, penalties and potential prosecution,” she said. [ How can I find what my likely State pension will be?Opens in new window ] Meanwhile, the department is planning to issue invitations to employers and representative groups “in the coming days” to an information event on the AE regime. “The event will be livestreamed and recorded to maximise outreach and will be supplemented by department-led webinars,” the spokeswoman said. The Irish Times first reported on Wednesday that former National Lottery chief executive Dermot Griffin has been selected to head up the agency that will oversee My Future Fund, the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa) – marking a major milestone in the project. It will be chaired by Roma Burke, an experienced actuary with extensive knowledge of the pensions industry. The introduction of the AE system has been the subject of a number of delays in recent years. The system is now set to start on January 1st. AE will apply to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 a year across one or more jobs and who are not already members of an occupational pension scheme. Employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the Government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in year 10. Under the auto-enrolment scheme, funds will be managed by three investment providers – Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and Blackrock. Indian information technology company Tata Consultancy Services was hired in 2024 to build and run the system. My Future Fund is expected to hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the Government.

Title: 5 biggest takeaways from the Nvidia Q2 earnings call

Time Published: 2025-08-28T02:43:49Z

Nvidia exceeded expectations once again in its second quarter of 2025, but China remains a question mark. On Wednesday, the chipmaking giant reported $46.74 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both beating analyst estimates. The company also forecast third-quarter sales of about $54 billion. Despite the upbeat earnings, Nvidia shares slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of forecasts for a second straight quarter, and as signs of slowing growth began to show. From the uncertainties around the H20 chips' shipment to China to the spending on AI infrastructure, here are the main takeaways from the chipmaking giant's earnings call. Colette Kress, the chief financial officer, said Nvidia has yet to ship any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers recently receiving licenses. On the earnings call, she said that shipments worth $2 billion to $5 billion could flow if restrictions ease, but the company has excluded that revenue from its third-quarter forecast. The company has also floated a 15% remittance to the US government on licensed sales, though no rule has been finalized. "We just have to keep advocating," CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," Huang added. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. Nvidia projected its Q3 revenue at $54 billion with a 2% margin, exceeding analysts' expectations of $53.4 billion. However, the company said its projections didn't include H20 sales to China, which are still uncertain. It also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Brian Mulberry, a senior portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told BI that he sees some parallels between Nvidia's current shares and times when Tesla would have strong financials but slowing guidance, which slows the growth in share prices. "Now NVDA is 'only' growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100%+ revenue growth from last year," said Mulberry. "As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock." Nvidia expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, said Kress. The CFO called it a "significant long-term growth opportunity." Her comments come as Big Tech ramps up spending in AI and fuels GDP growth, though some tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have warned that some investors may be overhyping the sector. Earlier this week, JPMorgan wrote in a note that the high capex spending points to strong growth forecasts in AI. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending," the bank wrote. "This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries." The build-out of AI models has powered Nvidia's growth in the last several years. Now comes robotics. "Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our data center platform," Kress said during the call. Robotics remains a small part of Nvidia's business, but Huang and Kress said they're seeing signs of growth. Jetson AGX Thor, Nvidia's latest robotics computing platform or "robot brain," was released earlier this week. Kress said the adoption of Thor "is growing at rapid rate," with more than 2 million developers taking the platform to market. The CFO also said automotive revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $586 million, primarily thanks to self-driving cars. Kress said Nvidia's successor to its popular Blackwell chip architecture, Rubin, is on track for volume production in 2026, giving investors the innovation, predictable product cycle, and revenue generator they like to see. While the earnings call didn't provide many details around the next-generation chip, Kress said the chips are "in fab," meaning that the manufacturing process has begun. "This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software," Kress said. Jump to

Title: Chip giant Nvidia’s sales rise 56% in boost for AI boom

US chipmaker reports revenue of $46.74bn for second quarter, defying fears that AI may be overhyped. By John Power Chip giant Nvidia has set a new sales record, a sign that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong despite fearsthe technology may be overhyped. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, on Wednesday reported revenue of $46.74bn for the three months that ended in July, a rise of 56 percent year-on-year. Profit for the quarter was $26.42bn, a yearly rise of 59 percent. Nvidia’s latest earnings report had been hotly anticipated as the tech giant is widely seen as a barometer of the AI boom, which has lifted the US stock market from all-time high to all-time high. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that production of Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia’s latest platform using its most advanced chips, was ramping up “at full speed” and demand for the company’s products was “extraordinary”. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its centre,” Jensen said. Looking ahead, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant predicted revenue of $54bn, plus or minus 2 percent, for the July-September quarter, which would be slightly above market expectations. Despite the robust results, Nvidia’s stock price fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, an indication of the sky-high expectations attached to the chipmaker, which is valued at more than $4.4 trillion. Nvidia’s sales notably did not include any shipments to China, whose market is subject to US government export controls intended to blunt Beijing’s ability to develop AI. US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this month lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, following concerted lobbying by Huang. As part of its agreement with the Trump administration, Nvidia agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of revenues from chip sales in China. The lifting of the ban on the H20 raises the possibility that Nvidia could have potentially enormous untapped sales potential in the world’s second-largest economy, though its prospects have been complicated by a recent directive by Beijing urging local firms against doing business with the company. “Just imagine what will happen to this stock if the China business even comes half back to life,” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter following capital markets, said. “Jensen Huang will undoubtedly be working overtime on the China situation. The AI Revolution is in full swing.” Fuelled by explosive demand for its AI, Nvidia’s revenue has grown at breakneck speed over the past two years. The company posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024. Since the start of 2023, the price of Nvidia shares has multiplied more than 11 times over, with the stock up more than 30 percent so far this year. The firm’s stellar performance, underpinned by multibillion-dollar AI investments by tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, has stoked discussion about whether AI could be in a bubble. In an interview with The Verge earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who oversaw the release of the groundbreaking AI model ChatGPT, said he believed that investors were “overexcited” about the technology.

Title: "This decision was not made lightly" — Tomb Raider dev Crystal Dynamics hit by "necessary" layoffs for second time this year, and I'm sick of writing this headline

Crystal Dynamics is going through another layoff wave after already facing cuts earlier in 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Waves of layoffs in the gaming industry continue to hit developers and publishers around the world, with Crystal Dynamics — the studio best known for its work as the steward of the legendary action-adventure franchise Tomb Raider — being the latest team to be affected. The developer announced the news on Wednesday afternoon on LinkedIn, confirming that "a number of our talented colleagues" were let go from the company in response to "evolving business conditions." "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," reads the studio's post. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." Notably, Crystal Dynamics has vowed to do everything it can to help affected employees in the wake of these layoffs, though it hasn't publicly mentioned any specific types of aid or compensation. "To those impacted — we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition," it said. The studio concluded its statement with appreciation for the support offered by its teams, business partners, and players, also noting that the Tomb Raider franchise is supposedly "unaffected" by the cuts. "To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision," reads the end of the notice. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. At present, it's unclear how many Crystal Dynamics workers have been affected by this latest wave of layoffs, or which specific divisions of the studio, if any, have been affected more than others. It's the second round of layoffs that the developer has gone through this year, with 17 workers also cut from the company in late March. Then, like now, it commented that the discharges were "necessary," and came due to a need to "better align our current business needs and the studio's future success." It's important to highlight that Crystal Dynamics is owned by Embracer Group, a massive Swedish video game holding firm infamous for the large number of layoffs and studio closures that have occurred under its wing. Much of the company's troubles in recent years have been attributed to the collapse of a critical $2 billion deal in 2022 that the firm was banking on, leading to share prices dropping by 40% in the aftermath. The developer is currently working on an untitled Tomb Raider game published by Amazon Games. It was also collaborating with Xbox studio The Initiative on the Perfect Dark reboot, though the partnership ended when Microsoft shuttered The Initiative and the Perfect Dark project in July. These new cuts at Crystal Dynamics are yet another instance of the layoffs that have swept through the gaming industry throughout the last several years, with roughly 40,000 developers in total affected. From Microsoft and Xbox, to Metal Gear Solid Delta's Virtuos Games, to Little Nightmares' Supermassive Games, to Destiny 2's Bungie, to Marvel Rivals' NetEase Games, these cuts have absolutely ravaged the industry, leaving thousands of hard-working developers out of work. The layoffs themselves have been largely attributed to overinvestment in gaming during the pandemic, with inflated interest in the industry lowering once stay-at-home mandates were lifted and daily life returned to normalcy. Wider global economic shifts are also a factor, as are rising game development costs. Though there's hope for a recovery in the near future, it's always harrowing to be met with the news of layoffs like these again and again, and frustrating to have to write this type of headline again and again, as well. For the sake of the people behind the creation of the games we love, I can only sincerely hope that the industry levels out as soon as it can. My heart, and the heart of everyone here at Windows Central, goes out to any and all developers affected by these layoffs and any others.

Title: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-staking-record-36-million-eth-shock/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T22:00:20Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) staking levels continue to break records, with the latest snapshot of the blockchain showing nearly 36.1 million ETH staked on the network – the highest level in history. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, close to one-third of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now staked. This high proportion suggests that ETH may be on the verge of a structural supply shock. The following chart shared by the analyst shows that even during sharp corrections in 2022 and 2023, staking levels continued to climb. Unlike speculative flows, which often exit the market during downturns, staking activity has proven “sticky” – with investors choosing to lock ETH into the network rather than liquidate. Staking ETH carries several key implications. First, it compresses supply – as more ETH is staked, less liquid supply remains on exchanges, creating a natural “supply shock” that amplifies demand-driven price moves. Similarly, it shows the priorities of investors. By staking ETH, investors essentially work as long-term participants. In this way, they align their incentives with network security and yield instead of short-term trading. ETH’s recent rally to $4,500 also coincided with record staking levels, creating a feedback loop – higher prices attracted institutional inflows from custodians, exchange-traded funds (ETG), and whales, while reduced liquid supply added further upward pressure. ETH ETFs now hold more than $300 billion in reserves, while asset managers such as BlackRock are actively accumulating. This underscores Ethereum’s transition from a speculative asset to a yield-bearing, institutionally supported infrastructure layer. U.S.-based spot ETH ETFs also enjoyed a long streak of positive inflows, lasting from the week ending May 16 through the week ending August 15. Commenting on this shift, XWIN Research Japan noted: Ethereum’s all-time-high staking levels reveal its underlying strength: while Bitcoin faces selling dominance in taker metrics, ETH is experiencing structural supply reduction. This divergence highlights Ethereum’s growing role not just as a crypto asset, but as the backbone of tokenization, DeFi, and RWA adoption. Similar sentiments were recently echoed by Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors. Lee noted that ETH is getting closer to becoming the backbone of global markets. That said, some risks remain. For instance, ETH price is still lagging despite ATH in daily network transactions. At the time, the analyst said that ETH was likely still in the accumulation phase. Similarly, the recent price pullback in ETH after creating a new ATH over $4,900 shows how recurring liquidation cycles are shaping ETH’s price action every week. At press time, ETH trades at $4,606, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Title: As Perfect Dark gets canceled and the next Tomb Raider's development stumbles on, Crystal Dynamics lays off even more developers while blaming "evolving business conditions"

This is the third round of layoffs in two years When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs, its third since the studio was acquired by Embracer Group in 2022. The news comes in the wake of the cancellation of Perfect Dark, which Crystal Dynamics was developing alongside Xbox studio The Initiative. "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," the studio says in a LinkedIn post (via GamesIndustry.biz). "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The post concludes by noting that development of the next Tomb Raider "remains unaffected by this decision." Very little about the game has been revealed since it was announced in 2022, other than the fact that it's in development on Unreal Engine 5 and will be published by Amazon Games. Crystal Dynamics did not disclose how many people were affected by today's layoffs. The company laid off 17 employees earlier this year, citing the need to "better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success." A further 10 people were laid off in 2023, that time to "align the studio with our current business needs." I guess the layoff form letters don't change much over the years. The last new game from Crystal Dynamics launched in 2020, while the studio was still a subsidiary of Square Enix. That game was Marvel's Avengers, a live-service mishap that launched to mediocre reviews and eventually shut down in 2023. The studio has contributed to some remaster projects, including Tomb Raider and Legacy of Kain, in recent years, but we're all still waiting to see what its next big game is.

Title: Instant View: Nvidia Q3 revenue forecasts suggest AI trade has more to run

(Reuters) - AI chipmaker Nvidia, the dominating force behind the U.S. stock market rally since 2023, forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday. Helped by robust demand for its artificial intelligence chips from cloud providers expanding infrastructure to power generative AI technology, Nvidia expects revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the third quarter. That compared with analysts' average estimate of $53.14 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Shares of the world's most valuable firm were down 2.4% in extended trading, paring a knee-jerk loss after the report. NVDA gained more than a third so far in 2025 to outpace the benchmark S&P 500 Index's year-to-date rise of nearly 10%. COMMENTS: THOMAS MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA GEORGIA "The overall AI trade is still very much intact. Nvidia said demand is just really, really high. So to the extent that you believe that, the AI trade is still at the very early stages." "There's nothing really to suggest that the AI trade is over. When you have something that is new, and it's growing as fast as it is, and all of the huge capex announcements from the hyperscalers, it's evidence that we're in the early stages. there's no reason that I can see that you want to sell this off to any great degree." WILL RHIND, FOUNDER AND CEO, GRANITESHARES "The market has gotten so used to NVIDIA delivering blowout earnings and data center growth that anything short of that feels like a disappointment. The modest miss on data center revenue is more a reminder that those huge growth rates are going to slow eventually." BRIAN MULBERRY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ZACKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "It is double beat on top and bottom line including the $8 billion China cost. After hours even with this strong outperformance the stock is down more than 3% - a signal that the rate of growth is slowing and that causes price momentum to slow in the shares. "We saw this with Tesla at times when they would have strong financials but guidance was slowing as capacity was meeting demand which ultimately slows the rate of growth. Now NVDA is “only” growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100% revenue growth from last year. As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock. "Manufacturing operations seem to be growing at a pace that forward guidance should be easily intact going forward. It looks like they stated the China impact (opportunity costs) of $8 billion which is right on target with Jensen’s previous public statements and in line with Wall Street expectations." DAVID WAGNER, HEAD OF EQUITY, APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS "The negative stock reaction feels like a bit of an incorrect knee-jerk reaction - the company is still growing over 50% on their guidance at a $50B quarterly revenue run rate - that's remarkable, even for the current valuation. I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue. I want to be buying the pullback as I am sure management will weave a bullish demand story on the conference call." NICK FRASSE, PRODUCT MANAGER, VANECK ASSOCIATES, NEW YORK “My takeaway is that these numbers are not unexpected, nor is this reaction. The market has begun to factor in that Nvidia can continue to beat most expectations in spite of headwinds and questions like what they will have to pay to continue selling to China. Their earnings beats and growth in EPS have become more normalized as investors understand their business model better. In the early stages of all this excitement, they had crazy beats that seemed to come out of nowhere; no one then had expected a gaming company to have this amazing AI pivot. Now we look at their business model and see that they don’t have the capital spending drag that vertically integrated companies do, but they’re benefiting from all the money that the hyperscalers clearly continue to keep spending on AI. "We launched the VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF exactly a year ago today, and Nvidia is its largest holding at 20.67% of the fund right now. These results give us confidence that the hyperscalers are not slowing down, and that it’s getting to the point now where as the Magnificent 7 companies continue to grow, it’s all compounding in their favor. This technology is allowing them to drive revenue higher – and then to spend more of that revenue on more technology.” MATT ORTON, HEAD OF ADVISORY SOLUTIONS, RAYMOND JAMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TAMPA BAY AREA "I think it should be a positive read-through eventually, after the dust settles, to the rest of the AI trade, and the fact that there's still a tremendous amount of growth that's happening." "For Nvidia, it's more of just calibration of expectations, but the fact that you saw such strong growth, particularly across the data centers, and just the absolute numbers that are associated with the revenues that are coming in, I think all of that is a sign that there is still a lot of room to run with respect to the AI capex story." "The mega caps are the ones propelling a lot of the capex that Nvidia is benefiting from. But obviously Nvidia still is growing, is able to sell. If anything, this just highlights that there's a lot of durability to this (AI) trade, and that, I think that the businesses of these hyperscalers can continue to accelerate, and you're not seeing any sort of signs of a slowdown being reflected in the results of Nvidia." "The results from Nvidia will just reaffirm the fact that we're not in an AI bubble." DIMITRI ZABELIN, SENIOR ANALYST, AI, PITCHBOOK, SAN FRANCISCO, CA "Since the onset of the AI boom in late 2022, the company has largely beaten forecasts, propelled by explosive growth in its data center division. "As U.S. hyperscaler demand continues to expand, Nvidia is diversifying by turning to sovereign buyers to anchor the next wave of adoption, positioning national governments as strategic clients for its hardware. "PitchBook’s comp sheet analysis also shows hyperscalers and AI infrastructure leaders outperforming benchmarks, underscoring durable demand for compute hardware as governments and enterprises step up procurement." LARRY TENTARELLI, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST, BLUE CHIP DAILY TREND REPORT "In the very short-term, the stock is seeing some downside testing, as they did not drastically exceed the consensus forecasts. Beyond the short-term volatility, Nvidia remains the benchmark Artificial Intelligence stock and the most direct way to invest in the theme. "The AI trade has been the major driver of this bull market over the past 30 months and we expect that both AI and Nvidia will continue to lead. "CEO Jensen Huang’s comments on the conference call will be closely monitored by markets, but barring any slowdown comments from Huang, we would be buyers of Nvidia on any near-term weakness. In our view, this is the dominant AI market leader to own." CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES, HAMMOND, INDIANA The results "were okay. They weren't blow-the-doors-off, but nor were they bad. And I think the stock price movement is going to depend a lot on what they say on the earnings call, especially if they give color on China." "I think people were a little disappointed in the data center number, which looks like the sequential growth was about 5% ... and I think people might have been looking for a little bit more on that side." "I'm not surprised that the stock in the after-market is down a bit, but it is not down a ton, especially given the strength that the stock is showing so far this year."

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Pull Just Ahead of Estimates

Nvidia (NVDA) reported quarterly earnings just slightly ahead of Wall Street analysts' expectations, as its sales rose to a record high. The AI chipmaker posted adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share on revenue that soared 56% year-over-year to a record $46.74 billion in the second quarter, above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. (Investopedia's live coverage of the results is here.) Nvidia said its profits benefited from the release of $180 million tied to sales of inventory of its H20 chips, which were banned in China during the quarter by the Trump administration's export controls, to a customer outside China. The chipmaker said that without its sales of previously reserved H20 chips outside of China, it would have reported EPS of $1.04. Data center sales, which make up the bulk of Nvidia's revenue, climbed to a record $41.1 billion, though that figure slightly missed Street projections. Several of Nvidia’s Big Tech customers have committed to big spending plans to build out their AI capacity in recent earnings calls, fueling analysts' lofty expectations, which climbed ahead of Wednesday's report. The chipmaker said its board also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Nvidia shares declined about 3% in after-hours trading. The stock added more than a third of its value in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. Looking ahead, Nvidia projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, which would be another record high. Wall Street analysts had called for revenue of $53.8 billion. However, that forecast doesn't take into account potential H20 sales to China, which could resume, thanks to a recent 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration. Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while it waits for the U.S. government to codify its revenue-sharing agreement. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company’s earnings call that he estimates China's market could represent a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year. The CEO also said he sees a "real possibility" Nvidia could be granted a license to sell its Blackwell chips (which are more powerful than H20) in China, as the company continues talks with the Trump administration about expanding its access to the region.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher Wednesday as investors anticipated the release of a quarterly update from semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) after the closing bell. The S&P 500 gained 0.2%, sending the benchmark index to another all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was also up 0.2%, while the blue-chip Dow closed Wednesday's session 0.3% higher. Recap Investopedia's coverage of today's trading here. Nvidia shares, which are up about 35% this year so far to lead the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks, were about flat in the regular session. Detailed coverage of its earnings is available here. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, jumped 7.5% to secure the S&P 500's top daily performance. The move higher came a day after UBS upgraded Albemarle to "neutral" from "sell" and lifted its price target on the stock. Analysts cited an improving outlook for lithium prices in 2026 following recent production cutbacks in China. Albemarle and other lithium producers have been cutting costs and scaling back expansion plans as they navigate a prolonged slump in the price of the key battery component. An upgrade from UBS also helped shares of casino operators. Analysts at the firm raised their view on Wynn Macau, a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) operating in the Asian gaming hotspot, to "buy" from "neutral." UBS highlighted improved growth forecasts for Macau's gross gaming revenue and suggested that high-end operators like Wynn are likely to sustain or increase their market share in the special administrative region. Wynn Resorts shares gained 3.5%, while shares of fellow Macau-exposed gaming companies MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) were also up more than 3%. Database software firm MongoDB (MDB) reported better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal second quarter and increased its full-year outlook, and its shares skyrocketed roughly 38%. Strong customer additions and subscription revenue growth underpinned the company's performance. The report helped boost the shares of other database software firms, including those of service analytics specialist Datadog (DDOG), which advanced 4.3%. Paramount Skydance (PSKY) shares dropped 6.5%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Wednesday. The stock has seen significant volatility since the completion of the merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global earlier this month. The latest move lower came after Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target on Paramount Skydance stock, citing a steep valuation and muted growth expectations for adjusted operating income. BofA Securities analysts downgraded SBA Communications (SBAC) to "neutral" from "buy" and cut their price target on shares of the wireless infrastructure real estate investment trust. The downgrade came after DISH TV operator EchoStar (SATS) said that it sold 50 megahertz of its nationwide low- and mid-band spectrum allocations to AT&T (T). Analysts believe the move suggests that AT&T could scale back its network densification efforts, which would have a negative impact on SBAC's business. SBAC shares lost 4.9% on Wednesday. Shares of J.M. Smucker (SJM) sank 4.4% after the food and beverage manufacturer reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter. The company said tariff-related pressure on its U.S. retail coffee division—home to the Folgers, Dunkin', and Café Bustelo brands—weighed on its performance. An executive said Smucker is planning addition price hikes for its coffee products later this year. A 50% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on certain imports from Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, took effect earlier this month.

Despite uncertainty about trade with China, Nvidia forecasts it will take in even more money than analysts expected in three months' time. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Thursday 28 August 2025 07:26, UK The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter? Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble.

Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down by up to 3% in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter, fuelling fears of a more persistent slowdown in growth ahead. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint. But Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "Smart investors will look through the noise. Nvidia has traded flat or down after results in four of the past five quarters, only to do all the heavy lifting after markets have had time to digest the results. "The law of large numbers seems irrelevant here - despite its scale, Nvidia continues to defy expectations as consensus underestimates the opportunity at hand. Third-quarter revenue guidance at $54bn is a strong number, especially when it factors in no benefit from Chinese sales."

Title: MicroStrategy Successfully Claims 3% Of Bitcoin Supply, Here’s How Much It’s Now Worth

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has achieved a milestone that cements its reputation as the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. A recent acquisition of 3,018 BTC on August 25 at a total purchase price of $357 million has pushed the company’s total Bitcoin portfolio to 632,457 BTC. Based on the current price of Bitcoin, the total value of the portfolio is valued at $46.502 billion. However, outside the value of its holdings, data shows that Strategy now controls over 3% of Bitcoin’s current circulating supply. According to Strategy’s website, the American-based technology company now holds 632,457 BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has a total circulating supply of 19,912,106, although the maximum supply is hard capped at 21,000,000. In numbers alone, Strategy now owns 3.176% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin. Claiming such a large share of Bitcoin shows the scale of the company’s commitment and its strategy of positioning Bitcoin as the backbone of its corporate treasury. Owning more than 3% of Bitcoin’s supply has not only been symbolic but also financially rewarding for Strategy. In the current quarter alone, its portfolio has grown by 4.7%, generating $3.156 billion in gains. Since the start of 2025, the value of its holdings has increased by 25.4%, amounting to an increase of $12.641 billion in dollar terms. The company’s Bitcoin-based investment’s profit in 2025 has already surpassed the entire profit of $13.133 billion recorded in 2024. Notably, this Bitcoin buying strategy means the company’s performance is now linked to Bitcoin’s price movements, with every percentage increase in BTC translating into billions in added value. According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, Strategy is by far the biggest public Bitcoin treasury company. The second is America-based digital asset technology company MARA Holdings, which currently holds 60,639 BTC. Strategy is now part of the top five Bitcoin holders, behind crypto exchange Coinbase, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Spot Bitcoin ETF issuer BlackRock, which has seen the value of its Bitcoin holdings grow to over 747,000 BTC in August 2025. Interestingly, Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio has even surpassed the total amount of BTC held in the Binance exchange reserve, which data from Coinglass currently puts at 578,903 BTC. Although holding over 3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is a milestone few companies could have imagined, Strategy’s ambitions are far from fulfilled. Co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor recently outlined a plan to raise $100 billion within the next four years to finance the company’s Bitcoin credit initiative. The financing could even reach up to $200 billion if the demand for the company’s securities is strong. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,300, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Cut welfare, give billions to Ukraine, suppress opposition: The German leader’s checklist to success
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/623597-merz-welfare-ukraine-opposition/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T16:43:42Z
Full Content:
By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory German chancellor Friedrich Merz has made a moderate media splash and ruffled some feathers in his own ruling coalition with the Centrist Social Democrats (SPD). Using the platform of a regional party congress of his CDU Conservatives in Niedersachsen, Merz has delivered a speech that immediately attracted national attention and will be remembered for one phrase. “The social [welfare] state, as we have it today,” the chancellor declared with appropriately dour mien, “can no longer be financed by what we are achieving economically.” Put differently, severe budget cuts on social issues are coming. And since that is a policy operative since, at the latest, 2003, there really isn’t so much left to cut. Merz is promising his people more of a bad time. His people. Not, however, the ultra-corrupt political anti-elite of Ukraine. Just before Merz’s claim that Germany cannot afford what it used to offer to Germans who pay for it, his government promised €9 billion ($10.4 bn) per year for Ukraine in 2025 and 2026, for now. That is on top of the €44 billion already sent that way. Germany is the “second-largest backer” of the Kiev regime in the world, as its obviously thoroughly detached finance minister Lars Klingbeil emphasizes with a perverse pride that must sound like a bad joke to many of his compatriots. Speaking of Klingbeil, in his Niedersachsen speech Merz also announced that he would “deliberately not make it easy” for his government colleagues from the SPD, who include, of course, Klingbeil. The SPD, of course, is well-known for being against harsh reductions in what Germans can expect from, in essence, old-age pensions, public health care, and the basic form of unemployment insurance now known as “Bürgergeld” (literally, “citizens’ money”). There is no reason to underestimate Merz’s genuine ideological commitment. It is true that, in general, he is unusually brutal about being dishonest even for a politician: Germany’s current leader has already proven that he is capable of breathtaking flipflops, staggering electoral bad faith, and underhanded maneuvering that violates the spirit of democracy if not the letter of the constitution. In the spring, his U-turn on public debt, to finance Germany’s new militarism on – exuberant – credit, was not only a massive breach of trust regarding especially his own conservative voters. Shamelessly exploiting a legal loophole, Merz also executed this radical reversal – many in his own party called it betrayal – by relying on parliamentary majorities that had already been cancelled by an election. Likewise, Merz’s coalition then proceeded to break promises regarding an energy tax relief as well as benefits for mothers. Germans are angry, but there is no sign that Merz and his government care. Consequently, according to a fresh poll by the reputable INSA institute, 62 percent of Germans are dissatisfied with their government. And yet, there is a hard core of authentic Merz, shaped by his own wealth, a very privileged life without material worries, and his long career as an overpaid member of the supervisory-board network nobility, at BlackRock and elsewhere: if there is one thing Germany’s leader is sincere about, it is his iron will to make the less well-off bleed more and work even harder, while making sure that those as materially comfortable and safe as himself get even richer. Call it neoliberalism with an unsmiling German face. Merz, of course, is also a very ordinary man, incapable of much self-reflection. He cannot honestly face any of the above. Instead he misunderstands himself as a savior of the fatherland, which he sees in need of much tough love and plenty of wholesome kicks up the backside to rediscover discipline, hard work, and competitiveness. The upshot of Merz’s blatant upper-class bias is, as a perspicacious German observer has put it, a de facto escalation of the ongoing re-distribution of income, wealth, and life chances – from those below to those above. Even now, 80 percent of the country’s taxes stem from income and value-added taxation. In other words: you work, you eat and keep a family going – be proud, you are also doing by far the most to pay the country’s bills. But Friedrich Merz, a millionaire who falls under “silver-spoon” rather than “self-made,” thinks it’s not yet enough. No wonder, then, that Merz’s recent speech in Niedersachsen has resonated. It was delivered in a sour as well as emphatic tone perhaps best described as schoolmasterly belligerence and featured much gratuitous no-compromise posing addressed probably more to his own doubting party and voters then his SPD coalition partners in Berlin. If Merz’s intention was to achieve a minor shock effect after Germany’s political summer break, he’s scored an ephemeral success. But his speech has also been misunderstood. In reality, its key message was something else and even worse. Yet another “business-friendly” – and business has also been very friendly to him – instinctive Western austeritarian telling his people they are having it too good and must lower their expectations? Not really news, is it? What was much more interesting was Merz’s reasoning. In his own words, the central political challenge is to prove that Germany “can be governed successfully from the center.” Or to be concrete, to keep down and out of power Germany’s two “populist” insurgent parties: from the right the very successful Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which tends to lead German opinion polls now, and, from the left, the currently marginalized – probably by foul play in the manner of, say, Romania or Moldova – but still threatening Bündnis Sarah Wagenknecht (BSW). Merz’s threat to go after what is left of the social welfare state in Germany comes with a promise of “reforms,” indeed a whole “autumn of reforms.” The purpose of this planned political offensive is clear: to persuade voters that they need not rely on those terrible “populists” to finally break out of the German doom loop of economic decline, demographic crisis, and pervasive malaise. Yet Merz’s strategy of what Germans call a “Befreiungsschlag” (a “deliverance strike”) smells of despair and is unlikely to succeed. Instead of an “autumn of reforms,” Germans are more likely to see their Winter of Discontent get even grimmer. Consider some basic data: We have just learned that Germany’s recession in the last quarter has been even worse than predicted: -0.3 instead of -0.1 percent. German industry is shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands. In general, Germany’s economy remains heavily dependent on exports. It has stagnated for half a decade already and been in serious trouble much longer. In the EU+Britain, it is the most brutally affected by Trump’s ongoing and still escalating tariff war against Washington's vassals. Klingbeil admits that the budget will be €170 billion short by 2029 – despite dialing debt up to eleven. And all of that when the German ruling coalition only has what the Financial Times rightly calls a “razor-thin” parliamentary majority. Add that two of the most damaging strikes against the German economy have been self-inflicted: Sky-high energy prices, the direct result of shutting Germany off from (direct) Russian supplies – with the alleged help of a few Ukrainian divers and their US friends, of course – and subservience to the US. That subservience has only grown worse under both Merz and his equally hapless predecessor Olaf Scholz. Both have been bending over backward to please and appease America, just when its policies have become even more brutal: We are at a moment in “atlanticism” when a US treasury secretary openly announces that Washington sees its allies’ economies as its very own “sovereign wealth fund” at the disposal not of their governments or – perish the thought – citizens, but of the US president. And Merz and co. grin and nod and ask for more. The irony of it all is that while slavishly compliant with the US, Merz cannot learn the single biggest, most obvious lesson of its very recent political history, although it quite literally stares him in the face every time he visits the Oval Office to grovel: Donald Trump has become president against enormous resistance not once but twice because he led a “populist” challenge against a rotten establishment that Americans saw as unpatriotic. The future of Merz is not the success of Trump but the defeat and disgrace of Biden and everything he stood for. Germans, too, will demand a government that looks after German interests before it makes even more demands of them. Grotesquely, Merz thinks he is the savior of the old German establishment. He is its gravedigger. And in that sense, all power to his misguided arm!

Title: Pundit Says Bitcoin Price Crash Is Not Over, Why A Decline Below $100,000 Is Coming

Time Published: 2025-08-27T15:00:02Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Mihai Jacob, a well-known market watcher, says the Bitcoin price rally that followed Powell’s Friday speech may not be as strong as it first looked. The charts, he explains, continue to flash signs of weakness that should not be ignored. According to Jacob, the flagship cryptocurrency could still face another sharp decline, and a drop below $100,000 remains a real risk despite the short-term optimism. Jacob explains that in his earlier analysis, he noted the $110,000 zone as a key level for Bitcoin. As long as that level held, the broader bullish structure could technically stay intact. Powell’s speech gave a hint of a possible rate cut, and for a moment, the market reacted with excitement, and Bitcoin bounced just as traders wanted. But Jacob quickly asks the hard question: was that bounce real strength, or just wishful thinking? He advises trading what you see, not what you hope for. And what he sees now on the charts does not match the initial joy of the rally. Soon after the move, Bitcoin returned to the $ 112,000 support level, erasing most of the gains. For Jacob, this suggests that the market may have been reacting to temporary news rather than initiating a new wave of growth. He warns that the bounce looks more like a retest of broken levels than a fresh start to a bigger move. In other words, what seemed like a comeback may actually be a signal that Bitcoin remains weak. Instead of buyers taking control, the chart suggests sellers are still in charge, waiting to push the price lower again. Looking at the bigger picture, Jacob points out that Bitcoin still trades below the trendline that has been in place since April, highlighting the shape of the price action, which suggests a possible head-and-shoulders pattern is forming around the $110,000 zone. While not perfectly shaped, it is still enough to make cautious traders uneasy about what may come next. For Jacob, the excitement that came from Powell’s speech was likely nothing more than “rate cut euphoria,” and he believes the market is sending a very different message from what headlines suggest. The idea that Bitcoin would simply return to the same support level, giving late buyers another easy opportunity, is, in his view, hard to believe. More likely, it was a “dead cat bounce,” a short-lived move before another fall. Jacob makes it clear that his current stance is neutral in terms of active positions, but his outlook leans bearish. Optimism may be tempting, but he insists that discipline requires traders to trust the charts, not their hopes. With Bitcoin still struggling under key levels, he sees the possibility of a decline below $100,000 as very real.

Title: Why Bitcoin miners say times are ‘grim’ as fee drought poses existential threat to network
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-mining-suffers-grim-time-as-activity-craters/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:41:33Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link What was once a bustling network is quickly turning into a graveyard of onchain activity. Daily transaction fees on Bitcoin have plunged more than 80% since April 2024, according to an August 20 report from Galaxy Digital. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners, the specialised computers that dedicate themselves to securing the network, are watching their revenue plummet as transaction fees dwindle. “It is grim for miners right now and there are no real catalysts on the horizon,” Nick Hansen, CEO of mining outlet Luxor, told DL News. “In fact, I’d say there’s mostly the opposite.” The collapse comes more than a year after Bitcoin’s 2024 halving slashed block rewards in half, leaving miners increasingly dependent on transaction fees that have largely disappeared. What’s draining the world’s largest blockchain of its activity? Ironically, it’s the arrival of what enthusiasts craved for a while: institutions. BlackRock and its ilk, which have accumulated more than 1.2 million Bitcoin through their exchange-traded funds, aren’t interested in actually using the network. Instead, they just want Bitcoin, buying over-the-counter, and then safeguarding on behalf of their assets. And while the buying has been torrential, it’s not been enough to lift transaction fees for the network or revenues for its miners. Other forces are also driving down margins for miners, including US President Donald Trump’s bellicose tariff regime, although none quite as powerful as Wall Street. While the Bitcoin industry has always been bound to catatonic lows and euphoric highs, to call the state of Bitcoin mining existential isn’t a stretch. When blocks don’t reach maximum capacity and activity dries up, miners lose the transaction fees that they need to offset operational costs, such as electricity, water, and upkeep. With block rewards already halved — and programmed to continue to halve — those fees are intended to be a lifeline. So far, that’s not panning out. For Bitcoin to have sustainable long-term economics, it needs a robust fee market that will eventually replace diminishing block rewards. That premise looks increasingly shaky as "paper Bitcoin" products take over and onchain activity withers. Nearly half of all Bitcoin blocks are “not full,” wrote Galaxy Digital, which means they are not reaching their maximum capacity. Moreover, about 15% of blocks are now processing transactions that are paying the lowest possible fee rate. “This is an existential problem to Bitcoin that I don’t see an obvious solution to in the short-to-mid term,” Hansen told DL News. The network’s mempool, once a bustling and competitive place where users bid up fees to get their transactions confirmed before others, now remains idle for hours at a time with hardly any activity. “Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has entered a lull,” wrote Will Owens, the author of Galaxy Digital’s report. When activity around Runes, Bitcoin’s take on memecoins, spiked last summer, speculative tokens accounted for 60% of daily volume. According to Owens, today it hovers at around 20%. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have swallowed 1.3 million coins worth a staggering $144 billion. For comparison, gold ETFs raked in $10 billion within three years of its launch in 2004. The problem is that every Bitcoin locked in an ETF is one less Bitcoin generating transaction fees. That’s because ETF providers package every transaction into one large tranche, settling the account at the end of the day, which results in a single transaction fee being paid. Bitcoin ETFs aren’t the only large players gobbling up coins. The top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold nearly 1 million Bitcoin, worth about $112 billion. Like Bitcoin funds, these treasury firms are also skipping transaction fees. Still, there’s hope. Hansen sees just one potential catalyst that could revive the fee market: actively managed Bitcoin treasuries. If companies like MicroStrategy — now known as Strategy — start actively trading their massive Bitcoin holdings rather than just hoarding, it could spark renewed on-chain activity. For Hansen, Bitcoin treasury companies are moving economic activity off-chain and keeping fees suppressed. “If [treasury companies] start being more actively managed, that could be a huge fee catalyst,” Hansen said. Until then, miners face a grim reality: Bitcoin’s success as an institutional asset has made the actual blockchain increasingly irrelevant.

Title: AI Bubble 2027
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-bubble-2027/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:37:21Z
Full Content:
Soundtrack: The Dillinger Escape Plan - One Of Us Is The Killer An MIT study found that 95% of organizations are getting "zero return" from generative AI, seemingly every major outlet is now writing an "are we in a bubble?" story, and now Meta has frozen AI hiring. Things are looking bleak for the AI bubble, and people are getting excited that this loathsome, wasteful era might be coming to an end. As a result, I'm being asked multiple times a day when the bubble might burst. I admit I'm hesitant to make any direct timelines — we are in a time (to quote former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan) of irrational exuberance, where the markets have oriented themselves around something very silly and very, very expensive. Regardless, Anthropic is apparently raising as much as $10 billion in its next funding round, and OpenAI allegedly hit $1 billion in revenue in July, which brings it in line with my estimate that it’s made about $5.26 billion in revenue in 2025 so far, The bubble "bursting" is not Sam Altman declaring that we're in a bubble — it's a series of events that lead to big tech pulling away from this movement, investment money drying up, and the current slate of AI companies withering and dying because they can't raise more money, can't go public, and can't sell to anybody. Anyway, earlier in the year, a bunch of credulous oafs wrote an extremely long piece of fan fiction called "AI 2027," beguiling people like Kevin Roose with its "gloominess." Written with a deep seriousness and a lot of charts, AI 2027 makes massive leaps of logic, with its fans rationalizing taking it seriously by saying that the five authors "have the right credentials." In reality, AI 2027 is written to fool people that want to be fooled and scare people that are already scared, its tone consistently authoritative as it suggests that a self-learning agent is on the verge of waking up, a thing that is so remarkably stupid that anyone who took this seriously should be pantsed again and again. These men are also cowards. They choose to use fake company names like "OpenBrain" to mask their predictions instead of standing behind them with confidence. I get that extrapolating years into the future is scary — but these grifting losers can't even commit to a prediction! Nevertheless, I wanted to take a run at something similar myself, though not in the same narrative format. In this piece, I'm going to write out what conditions I believe will burst the bubble. Some of this will be extrapolations based on my own knowledge, sources, and writing hundreds of thousands of words on this subject. I am not going to write a strict timeline, but I am going to write how some things could go, and how (and why) they'll lead to the bubble bursting. For the bubble to burst, I see a few necessary conditions, though reality is often far more boring and annoying. Regardless, it's important to know that this is a bubble driven by vibes not returns, and thus the bubble bursting will be an emotional reaction. This post is, in many respects, a follow-on to my previous “pale horse” article (called Burst Damage). Many of my original pale horses have already come true — Anthropic and OpenAI have pushed price increases and rate limits, there is already discord in AI investment, Meta is already considering downsizing its AI team, and OpenAI has done multiple different "big, stupid magic tricks," the chief of them being the embarrassing launch of GPT-5, a "smart, efficient router" that I reported last week was quite the opposite. This time, I'm going to write out the linchpin events that will shock the system, and how they might bring about the bubble bursting. I should also be clear, and I will get to after the premium break, that this will be a series of events rather than one big one, though there are big ones to look out for. I also think it might "take a minute," because "the bubble bursting" will be a succession of events that could take upwards of a year to fully happen. That’s been true for every bubble. Although people associate the implosion of the housing bubble with the “one big event” of Lehman Brothers collapsing in 2008, the reality is that it was preceded and followed by a bunch of other events, equally significant though not quite as dramatic. One VC (who you'll read about shortly) predicted it will take 6 quarters to run out of funding entirely based on the current rate of investment, putting us around February 2027 for things to have truly collapsed. Here's a list of some of the things that I believe will have to happen for this era to be truly done, and the ones that I believe are truly essential. The common thread through all of these points is that they are predominantly impossible to ignore. So far this bubble has inflated because the problems with AI — such as "it doesn't make any money" and "burns billions of dollars" — have been dismissed until very recently as the necessary costs of the beautiful AI revolution. Now that things have begun to unravel, the intensity of criticism will increase gradually, rather than in one big movement that makes everyone say "we hate AI." And it isn't just because of the money. CEOs like Tobias Lutke of Shopify have oriented their companies’ entire culture around AI, demanding in his case that "employees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources." Generative AI is, on some level, a kind of dunce detector — its flimsy and vague use cases having enough juice to impress the clueless Business Idiots who don't really engage with the production that makes their companies money. The specious, empty hype of Large Language Models — driven by a tech and business media that has given up on trying to understand them — symbolizes a kind of magic to these empty-headed goobers, and unwinding their "AI-first" cultures will be difficult...right up until the first guy does it, at which point everybody will follow. AI has taken such a hold on our markets because it's symbolic of a few things: In any case, I am going to try and write the things that I think will happen, in detail. I'll go into more conditions in this piece, and as discussed, I'm going to make some informed guesses, extrapolations, and give my thoughts about how things collapse. I predict that the impact of Large Language Models over the next decade will be enormous, not in its actual innovation or returns, but in its ability to expose how little our leaders truly know about the world or labor, how willing many people are to accept whatever the last thing a smart-adjacent person said, and how our markets and economy are driven by people with the most tenuous grasp on reality. This will be an attempt to write down what I believe could happen in the next 18 months, the conditions that might accelerate the collapse, and how the answers to some of my open questions — such as how these companies book revenue and burn compute — could influence outcomes.

Title: Serve Robotics’ Target Of Deploying 2,000 Level 4 Autonomous Urban Delivery Robots By Year End Is Now Attracting Wall Street’s Attention

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The age of robots is neigh, and the market is currently sifting through the available players to sniff out those with an intrinsic advantage. Enter Serve Robotics, whose partnership with NVIDIA and Uber demands a prominent place in the last-mile urban delivery space. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Serve Robotics is currently pioneering 4-wheeled robots that leverage AI to navigate dense cityscape. These third-gen robots support advanced sensing tech and copious onboard computing resources, thanks to NVIDIA's Jetson Orin module. Of course, NVIDIA had precipitated a significant rally in Serve Robotics' stock in 2024 when it took a 10 percent stake in the company. Interestingly, NVIDIA divested the entirety of its stake in Q4 2024. Do note that Serve Robotics is currently partnered with Uber Eats to offer autonomous food deliveries in US cities such as Los Angeles. In the second quarter of 2025, the company deployed 120 delivery robots, bringing its total fleet strength to 400. Critically, Serve Robotics intends to expand its robot fleet size by 400 percent to 2,000 units by the end of 2025. Wedbush starts Serve Robotics $SERV at Outperform with a $15 PT — about 46% upside from here. Calls out strength in its autonomous delivery platform tied to AI growth. Shares sold off after $NVDA trimmed its stake, but Uber still holds ~8% and remains a key partner. It is this aggressive growth spurt that is now attracting Wall Street's attention. For instance, Wedbush has just initiated its coverage on the stock with a $15 stock price target, implying a 35 percent upside from the current price levels. Similarly, earlier in August, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on Serve Robotics shares, replete with a $17 stock price target. Serve Robotics announced $642,000 in revenue in Q2 2025, which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 46 percent. The company's strong liquidity position of $183 million (as of the end of Q2) has played an important role in aiding its hyper-aggressive expansion efforts. The company is also tapping into multiple revenue streams. For instance, it is selling advertising space on its delivery robots, allowing advertisers to gain visibility as these delivery robots become an increasingly common sight on urban walkways. Serve Robotics has a low-cost CapEx model, where it outsources the actual manufacturing of its iconic robots to Magna. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to price its delivery services at a more competitive sub-$8 price point, allowing a break-even period of less than 2 years for each robot.

Title: NZBA will vote to abandon membership model after industry exodus

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. After waves of exits by U.S., Canadian and European banks, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance said it would vote on forgoing a membership-based model and focus on establishing industry guidance. Following President Donald Trump’s reelection in November, large U.S. banks began an exodus from the United Nations-aligned Net-Zero Banking Alliance that expanded to U.S. asset managers before rippling beyond the nation’s borders. On Wednesday, NZBA announced its steering committee will hold a vote to reframe its mission and move away from a membership-based model, replacing it with a focus on establishing industry guidance. NZBA said in the announcement that it will pause all ongoing activities until the vote concludes and results are announced at the end of September, making it the second UN-backed net-zero industry organization to suspend activities this year. The banking climate alliance, backed by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative, was formed in 2021 with 43 members and at least tripled in size at one point, according to NZBA’s site. The organization’s website no longer contains a membership list or its signatory pledge; both links redirect to NZBA’s main webpage. Here’s a recap of how the organization got here. Even prior to Trump’s reelection in November, major U.S. banks and financial institutions had been subject to multiple Republican-led state probes and House Congressional investigations for being members of NZBA and other industry climate alliances. After the 2024 election, with Trump buoyed by Republican control of the House and Senate, six major U.S. banks — including five of the six largest U.S. banks — announced NZBA exits prior to the inauguration. Goldman Sachs was the first in December of last year, followed by Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup before the end of the year. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase left the alliance in early January. All six banks had been targets of separate state probes by Republican state attorneys general and state heads of agriculture. Following the bank exits, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ended prior probes into Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. “Companies don’t want to step in the way of [Trump’s] agenda … they don’t want to jump in front of that freight train,” Arvin Vohra, CEO of energy-as-a-service provider Redaptive, told ESG Dive after the exodus of U.S. banks. Despite leaving NZBA, the banks have largely maintained their net-zero commitments and goals, with the exception of Wells Fargo — which dropped a 2050 net-zero financed emissions target in March. Another coalition of state attorneys general ended a probe into Wells Fargo shortly after the bank dropped its net-zero target. The U.S. defections were not contained to banks. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced it was exiting the UN-backed Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9, telling clients that the membership was creating confusion around the firm’s practices and making it subject to “legal inquiries from various public officials,” executives said in a reported letter. NZAM announced an operational pause shortly afterwards on Jan. 13, and Northern Trust Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management later left the climate alliance. The latter cited the pause as its reason for departing. Wall Street’s departure from NZBA first rippled north of the U.S. border to Canadian banks. Before the end of January, Canada’s six largest banks also announced their exits from NZBA. TD Bank, National Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce each announced their intent to depart on Jan. 20, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration in the U.S. Canada’s largest bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, departed Jan. 31. NZBA updated its guidelines for how banks should set climate targets in April, forgoing a prior requirement for members to strictly target limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The group’s updated guidance, instead, required signatories to align targets with limiting warming “to well below 2 [degrees Celsius], striving for 1.5°C.” On the same day the updated guidance was announced, Netherlands-based Triodos Bank exited the group and explicitly blamed the guidance’s lowered standards for its departure. The bank said in a release that the standards “fall short of the needed urgency to align loans and investments portfolios with the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming scenario.” Outside of Triodos’ exit, all of the prior departures had been tightly grouped in time and location around Trump’s election and inauguration. The exodus jumped across the pond in July, after U.K.-based HSBC said it was disassociating from the climate alliance and U.K.-based Barclays also quit the alliance. The departures hopped borders again in early August, when Swiss bank UBS withdrew from the alliance. “As we look ahead, NZBA remains focused on supporting the many committed banks driving this transformation forward,” an NZBA spokesperson told ESG Dive after UBS’ exit. “The need for bold action from the banking sector has never been greater and NZBA is here to help deliver it.” In announcing the vote to move away from a membership-based model, NZBA is addressing a point of contention that Republican state and federal officials have raised in recent years. The officials have alleged that members of NZBA, NZAM and other alliances like Climate Action 100+ have committed antitrust violations through pledges the groups require to orient asset and financed emissions towards net-zero emissions. NZBA said Wednesday it recognizes there is a “major opportunity for banks and key stakeholders to build on” its work and “encourages the banking sector to remain steadfast in implementing their net-zero commitments.” “The steering group believes this is the most appropriate model to continue supporting banks across the globe to remain resilient and accelerate the real economy transition in line with the Paris Agreement, as well as to continue engagement with the global banking industry to develop further guidance and tools needed to support them and their clients,” NZBA’s Aug. 27 update said. Katrin Ganswindt, coal and divestment campaigner for German-based environmental nonprofit Urgewald, had pointed criticism following Wednesday’s announcement and told ESG Dive that “voluntary alliances like NZBA did not deliver.” “Fossil fuel finance needs effective regulation, which would also improve the financial system's resilience,” Ganswindt said in an emailed statement. “Central banks, bank regulators and oversight agencies should finally step up to the plate. They should start by drawing a clear line at the financing of fossil fuel expansion.” Before NZBA announced the vote, Trillium Asset Management Director of Shareholder Advocacy Andrea Ranger told ESG Dive that whether the various departures were to avoid the legal risks of potential antitrust allegations by U.S. political entities, “the fact of the matter is that [NZBA] oriented these companies toward a net-zero strategy.” “Ultimately, what we really want [the banks] to do is actually do the work,” Ranger said in an interview last week. “Whether they’re part of an alliance or not — I think it would be better if there were that collective momentum versus each company doing their own thing — but we just want them to do the work. And if that helped them get there, then that's great.” YOU MUST AGREE TO OUR TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY. Already a subscriber? Sign in with your email above.

Title: Buy MSFT Stock At $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the top performers this year, with its stock climbing 20%. This is well ahead of the broader market, where the S&P 500 has risen 10%, while peers like Amazon are up only 4%, and Google has gained less than 10%. This strong performance is primarily driven by rapid cloud growth and sustained momentum in AI adoption. Microsoft's leadership in the expanding AI sector has clearly boosted investor confidence. At a current price of more than $500, is MSFT stock still attractive? We believe it is. Our evaluation of Microsoft across Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows a company with excellent operating results and a strong financial position, as outlined below. That being said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since launch. Also, see – Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100? On a sales or profit basis, MSFT stock appears very expensive relative to the broader market. Microsoft’s revenues have expanded meaningfully over the past few years. Microsoft’s profit margins are significantly stronger than most peers in the Trefis universe. Microsoft’s balance sheet appears extremely strong. MSFT stock has fared slightly better than the S&P 500 during certain downturns. Concerned about downturn risks? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Microsoft Stock? offers a detailed view of how MSFT performed during past market crashes. In summary, Microsoft’s performance across the parameters is: • Growth: Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Strong Microsoft has delivered across all dimensions, justifying its premium valuation. At around $500 per share, the stock trades at 37x trailing earnings, slightly above its four-year average P/E of 35. We believe this premium is warranted, with more upside possible. This view is supported by strong Azure sales and rising profitability, as its operating margin increased from 41.8% in 2023 to 45.2% now. Of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors may hesitate to pay a higher premium. But if you believe in AI-driven growth and have a 3–5 year horizon, Microsoft remains a compelling stock. Remember, individual stock investing carries risks. Trefis’ High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a basket of 30 stocks—has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years, delivering better returns with lower risk.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) has surged 600% year-to-date, holding the world’s largest corporate Ethereum position of 1.7 million ETH valued at $8 billion. This far exceeds other corporate ETH holders, giving the company unmatched leverage to Ethereum price movements. With continued purchases underscoring management’s conviction, traditional metrics like revenue or margins become secondary—this is pure cryptocurrency exposure on a massive scale. But can the stock double again from here? The answer is yes. Below, we outline the potential drivers behind such a move. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering more than 91% returns since inception. Also see – MongoDB: Up 30% Is MDB Stock Still A Buy? BitMine’s holding of 1.7 million ETH provides interesting opportunities, including strategic initiatives and institutional partnerships, that smaller holders cannot achieve. Ongoing purchases reinforce management’s confidence and bolster its leverage with crypto infrastructure providers. For the stock to double, two factors must align: Ethereum must appreciate in value, and the company must manage its treasury effectively. While the upside is immense, the risks scale equally. For instance, the stock once lost 88% of its value during the 2022 downturn. Ultimately, BitMine delivers unmatched Ethereum exposure through the public markets. But success depends almost entirely on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, not traditional business fundamentals. Keep in mind, investing in individual stocks—especially those tied to cryptocurrencies—carries substantial risk. For broader exposure, explore the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have typically offered higher returns with less volatility than the benchmark—delivering a smoother ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Ethereum dominates despite ‘killer’ altcoins: ETFs boost ETH

Why is fresh institutional money flowing into ETH and not BTC? Ethereum surged as BlackRock accumulated $314 million and spot ETFs drew $455 million in inflows. Treasury firms added 3.56 million ETH, pushing it toward institutional adoption. Ethereum [ETH]’s momentum in the latter half of 2025 is proving hard to ignore. Beyond its record-breaking price surge, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is dominating the ETF arena and attracting deep-pocketed institutions. The latest signal came from BlackRock, which added nearly $315 million worth of ETH in recent transactions. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham revealed that BlackRock has quietly executed one of its largest Ethereum purchases yet, amassing $314.9 million worth of ETH across multiple transactions. The world’s top asset manager used ETF-linked wallets to scoop up Ethereum in tranches, with several 10,000 ETH transfers (worth around $46 million each) coming from Coinbase Prime hot wallets. Smaller frequent buys followed, such as a batch of 2,691 ETH. This accumulation isn’t happening in isolation. A new class of “Ethereum Treasury Firms,” publicly traded companies such as BitMine, SharpLink, and ETHZilla have also been adding ETH to their balance sheets. Collectively, these firms now hold over 3.7 million ETH, nearly 3% of the total supply. The timing of these purchases was critical. Ethereum traded at $4,578.88 at press time, up 3.3% in 24 hours and 9% on the week. Moreover, on the 26th of August, spot ETH ETFs posted $455 million of inflows, according to Farside Investors. Such momentum has fueled bullish forecasts, with Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine and Head of Research at Fundstrat, arguing that ETH remains undervalued and should be trading closer to $6,000. Even now, Solana [SOL], Avalanche [AVAX], Polygon [MATIC], Aptos [APT], and Sui [SUI] compete in niches such as gaming, high-speed transactions, and enterprise adoption. However, Ethereum has secured its dominance through Layer-2 scaling solutions and its role as the settlement layer of the ecosystem. As AMBCrypto previously noted, the outdated “Ethereum killer” label no longer applies. Instead, the industry is evolving into a multi-chain landscape where Ethereum remains the foundation while specialized chains thrive in parallel.

Title: 30 Aug Presale, Bitcoin Swift Arrives As Solana Makes Headlines

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Crypto adherents are keeping a close eye on one of the most talked-about giants in the market: Solana. Solana has rallied by nearly 10% in late August, currently trading between $187 and $206, with analysts predicting a potential breakout toward $250–$300 if ETF clarity is achieved. SOL is demonstrating the strength of institutional interest, with Solana attracting $1.25 billion from Pantera Capital. Alongside these heavyweights, another project is creating shockwaves: Bitcoin Swift (BTC3). Already, $1.3 million has been raised, with more than 5,500 users having joined. An early launch has been officially announced for August 30, accompanied by a massive bonus structure for participants. Solana continues to impress with high throughput and low costs, attracting big names like BlackRock and CME as it becomes a cornerstone of tokenized assets. The asset showcases the strength of blockchain adoption today. However, neither Solana pays its holders direct, programmable staking rewards at every stage. That is what makes Bitcoin Swift different. BTC3 is designed to reward participants today, not just after launch, and its presale payouts prove that. Bitcoin Swift is not just another token. It is a next-generation defi operating system. At its core is Proof-of-Yield (PoY), a dynamic system that distributes rewards based on network activity, governance, and environmental efficiency. The result is programmable rewards sent at the end of each presale stage. BTC3 launches first on Solana, giving ultra-fast transactions and fees below $0.01 while tapping into an ecosystem of over 400 projects. Then, in 2026, it will migrate to its own blockchain via a 1:1 trustless bridge, scaling up to institutional adoption. The countdown has begun. Stage 7 is the last stage before launch, and only three days remain. To mark this milestone, BTC3 introduced the “Everything Must Go Bonus Event,” rewarding the fastest 130: The numbers are staggering. A Tier 4 contributing $10,000 secures $30,000 worth of BTC3 instantly at presale price. If BTC3 trades at $15 post-launch, that position skyrockets beyond $60,000. The math explains why this final stage is moving so quickly. BTC3 is capped at 45 million tokens. Allocation is carefully structured: 50% for PoY rewards (22.5M), 30% for presale (13.5M), 15% for liquidity pools (6.75M), and 5% for team and reserves (2.25M). This ensures long-term sustainability and scarcity. Additionally, the roadmap demonstrates that BTC3 is more than just hype. This trajectory ensures BTC3 is a project built to deliver both short-term excitement and long-term adoption. Security is equally strong. Cyberscope Audit, Solidproof Audit, and Spywolf Audit have reviewed BTC3. On top of this, full KYC verification has been completed, making it one of the safest opportunities on the market. The crypto community is buzzing with excitement as influencers dissect BTC3’s potential: These insights are driving even more attention as the presale draws to a close. Solana is proving that institutional adoption is here. However, Bitcoin Swift combines both short-term explosive rewards and a roadmap that stretches into 2026, giving it the edge. With only 3 days left before its August 30 launch, $1.3m raised, and bonus events rewarding speed, BTC3 is the most urgent opportunity in the market today.

Chipmaker Nvidia is poised to release a quarterly report that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that’s still gathering mome... SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. What do you do when 96% of your revenue comes from coconut water and 100% of your supply comes from tropical countries targeted by Donald Trump with high tariffs? This is exactly the situation confronting one of the nation’s hottest small cap companies today, $516 million (revs) Vita-Coco of New York City, the leading maker of coconut water. Its biggest source of coconuts, has heretofore been Brazil, a country now squarely in the crosshairs of a proposed 50% tariff, courtesy of the Trump administration. Its six other sources for coconuts aren’t much better: Philippines (tariff: 19%), Malaysia (19%), Vietnam (20%), Indonesia (19%) Thailand (19%) and Sri Lanka (20%). Still, you wouldn’t know that Vita Coco was facing a Trump tariff nightmare given the company’s bullish tone—or its stock performance. Shares are up nearly 32% over the past 12 months, outperforming many better-known consumer-staples names. Even with the stock down roughly 5% year-to-date as the broader market rallies, Wall Street is shrugging off Vita Coco’s inevitable pricing pressure. “Brazil is really a nonissue for us [if enacted],” insists co-founder and executive chairman Michael Kirban. “We started working on reallocating our Brazil supply, which historically goes to the United States, to supply Europe and Canada, several weeks ago.” The main source of supply for Europe, meanwhile—the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Malaysia—will now all shift to the U.S. “This is something we can pull the trigger on really quickly,” reasons Kirban, seemingly unconcerned about the high tariffs in his alternative source countries. He goes on: “With decreasing ocean freight rates and pricing [increases] we took earlier this year to mitigate the initial 10% baseline tariffs, we think we are in a good position.” Co-founder Kirban says he doesn’t expect to pass any further price hikes in the coming months, but this may be wishful thinking if Trump doesn't back away from his harsh tariffs on tropical countries. Here is what Vita Coco CEO Martin Roper said on the Q2 earnings call held a few weeks ago: “Our planned U.S.-based price increase in May to cover inflationary cost of goods pressures produced an approximately 7% increase at U.S. food retailers according to Circana over the quarter.” However the May price increase does not include another recent price increase implemented in the current quarter, which Vita Coco management refuses to provide Forbes details on. For now, Wall Street is putting its faith in Vita Coco management. By working with seven of the largest coconut processors in the world, Vita Coco currently controls roughly 40% of the U.S. coconut-water market, far ahead of smaller competitors like Goya and Harmless Harvest. “Coca-Cola tried to enter this market, buying Zico, and Pepsi also failed,” Larry Carlin, an equity analyst at $8 billion (assets) Conestoga Capital Advisors who is hopeful that Vita Coco’s strong position will give it more flexibility in the face of looming tariffs. “They’ve developed a supply chain with substantial barriers to entry,” adds Carlin. Founded by two friends in 2003 after a chance bar room encounter in Manhattan, Vita Coco’s met with early success in its first decade, thanks in part to celebrity investors including Madonna, Demi Moore, and Matthew McConaughey. However about a decade into their journey growing pains hit—thin margins, distribution hiccups and a rocky 2021 IPO kept many institutions away. But over the past two years the company has executed a disciplined turnaround, tightening its supply chain after the Covid pandemic. It has also expanded its portfolio of offerings into protein-infused PWR LIFT, aluminum-canned Ever & Ever water, and most recently, the coconut-milk-based beverage line Vita Coco Treats. Up until the onslaught of Trump’s tariffs, Vita-Coco was the envy of the Russell 2000, appearing near the top of Forbes Best Small Companies ranking in 2024. The stock is up 133% since its IPO, and five-fold from its low in 2022. On the company’s second quarter earnings call, held July 30th, CFO Corey Baker noted that Vita Coco is pursuing a formal tariff exemption request with U.S. trade officials. If that isn’t granted, management basically told shareholders to brace themselves: “If [the 50% Brazilian tariff is] enacted, we would ultimately need to pass through price increases,” says Baker. “Even under a worst-case scenario, we believe we could pass through price if necessary while maintaining share.” On Wall Street, six of the ten analysts covering Vita Coco rate it a “buy”, while the other four give it a “hold” rating, often interpreted as “sell” by investors. Short sellers have begun to circle its stock. A 23-page March 2025 report by UK-based short-seller NINGI Research accused Vita Coco of numerous underlying business problems including failed attempts at diversification, supply chain foul ups and millions in CEO and insider stock sales. NINGI’s main argument was that the company was an unsustainable growth story: “Vita Coco is nothing more than a one-trick pony" and an "operational basket case,” it wrote. The report's most impactful claims were that Vita Coco had lost its large private-label contract with Costco due to supply chain mismanagement, which would lead to a significant revenue hit. While Vita Coco publicly refuted the report as containing "inaccuracies and mischaracterizations," subsequent public statements and financial results support NINGI’s allegations about the lost Costco contract. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report confirmed a significant 36.5% decline in private-label sales. Today, a 12-pack of Costco's own in-house private label brand, Kirkland Signature coconut water, sells for $12.99 versus $19.59 for a 12 pack of Vita Coco at Target. Vita Coco has also publicly acknowledged that inventory constraints in 2024 led to "unacceptable private label service levels." Despite these issues, Vita Coco bulls maintain that the company’s core branded coconut water business is strong. Ever the optimist, Kirban is unfazed. “Sales are continuing to perform really nicely. So I think consumers are willing to pay,” says Kirban, referring to his tariff related price hikes. “This is a product that comes from a tree. It's not created in a lab, and it is three and a half times the electrolytes of the leading sport drink.”

Title: Will AI Be the Next Dot-Com Bubble?

As AI continues to rake in funds despite questions about long-term profitability, some experts are calling for more diversification. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Is it time for investors to slow their AI roll? Some experts think so. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made headlines last week when he described the AI craze as a bubble. Combined with ChatGPT-5’s botched rollout earlier this month and some signs of sliding among tech stocks, that prompted investors to question whether the AI boom is set to go bust in the near future, like the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s. Still, AI-focused ETFs continue to hit the market, with VettaFi listing 48 in its database, and expert outlooks are mixed. “I think it’s important to be aware of the risk,” said Claire Cantalupo, senior market analyst at InvesTech Research. “It doesn’t necessarily mean AI is going to crash tomorrow.” There are a few things to look for when evaluating a possible bubble, Cantalupo said. One is a paradigm shift: a new technology or innovation leading to a surge in optimism and high valuations, with investors losing their sense of risk and reward. Another is “a universal belief that this time is different.” AI could, and probably will, change the world, she added, but it may also be causing inflated valuations that aren’t sustainable. During the dot-com boom, for example, equipment provider Cisco ranked as a major player, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company with a market cap topping $500 billion. But it lost 90% of its value in the two years after the bubble burst in 2000. “The unfortunate reality is the top 10 companies in the S&P make up 40% of it by market capitalization,” Cantalupo said. “So investors who think they’re diversified by investing in index funds are actually far more exposed to just a small basket of stocks than they think they are.” Other potential indicators that the AI boom is a bubble include: Artificially Sweet. The S&P 500 continues to climb because of a few tech stocks — Nvidia, Meta and others — with massive AI projects. The projects could lead to too much hype, said Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Meta, for instance, has reportedly offered huge compensation packages to AI engineers that could lose value if the company’s stock falls. Still, Colello expressed optimism, based in part on continued demand for Nvidia’s products. “Certainly, there will be businesses that fail to live up to lofty valuations and times where AI expands too quickly,” he said. “However, we don’t think these dynamics are plaguing the large AI leaders just yet.” There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. Cash is king, but income-generating mutual funds and ETFs are increasingly being used for clients, Nasdaq found. The company’s massive asset moves may, in part, reflect institutional investors’ entry into the industry, particularly crypto. Meg Ryan, a lecturer at Harvard with a background in military law, will take over next month as director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The latest ETFs from F/m Investments and Compoundr help institutional investors avoid taxes on income distributions. Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. © 2025 The Daily Upside

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.fj5u93ykx Share article Print article To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, we’re pitting Jane Austen’s much-loved novels against each other in a battle of wit, charm and romance. Six leading Austen experts have made their case for her ultimate novel, but the winner is down to you. Cast your vote in the poll at the end of the article, and let us know the reason for your choice in the comments. This is Jane Austen Fight Club – it’s bonnets at dawn… Championed by Lucy Thompson, lecturer in 19th-century literature and creative writing, Aberystwyth University Sense and Sensibility is Austen’s most quietly radical novel. As her first published work, it may be less polished than her later fiction, but it is no less incisive. It lays bare the emotional cost of living in a world governed by reputation, family obligation and gendered expectation. Excluded from inheritance and displaced from their home, the Dashwood sisters must navigate constant scrutiny. Through Elinor and Marianne, Austen dramatises two strategies for survival in a society obsessed with appearances. Born from an earlier epistolary draft, the novel retains a sharp interest in how information circulates and misleads. Gossip doesn’t just constrain; it distorts. Letters are spied upon, conversations overheard. Assumptions take on the weight of fact. In this world, everyone watches – but not everyone truly sees. Sense and Sensibility may wear a quieter face than Emma or Pride and Prejudice, but it is Austen’s sharpest early critique of how appearances govern lives. This article is part of a series commemorating the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth. Despite having published only six books, she is one of the best-known authors in history. These articles explore the legacy and life of this incredible writer. Championed by Andrew McInnes, reader in English literature, Edge Hill University Everyone already knows the best Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice. Why? Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy is so charismatic that you might mistake the novel’s title for an abstract problem, and not Darcy’s pride versus her prejudice. We share her prejudices because Austen makes them so delicious. We roll our eyes at Mrs Bennet because Lizzy finds her exasperating. Wickham is seductive because he satisfies our inner bitch. And we fall in love with Darcy alongside Lizzy. Pride and Prejudice is the funniest and sexiest of Austen’s novels. In it, she allows herself a swoon-worthy romance without a hitch. Unlike Northanger Abbey’s Henry Tilney, Darcy doesn’t fall in love because Lizzy adores him, but falls first. Darcy is a complex man – shy, domineering, funny – and not a drip like Eds Ferrars (Sense and Sensibility) or Bertram (Mansfield Park). And unlike Emma, Lizzy builds healthy relationships with other women. Austen called Pride and Prejudice “too light and bright and sparkling” and joked that it could do with an essay on Walter Scott or Napoleon. But we know that would be a crime. It is just light and bright and sparkling enough to outshine the others. Championed by Amanda Vickery, professor in early modern history, Queen Mary University of London Pride and Prejudice is often the first grown-up novel young girls read, but Mansfield Park is the only Austen novel about a little girl growing up. All Austen’s fictions are versions of the female-centred courtship novel, usually covering a single year, with the heroine safely married to a deserving gentleman by the last page. Yet her heroines are mostly formed young women. Only in Mansfield Park do we meet our heroine as a little girl – and a puny and cowering little girl at that. Mansfield Park is Austen’s bildungsroman (the novel of becoming) on a par with that other girls’ classic, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (1847). Like poor, plain Jane, Fanny Price is a girl of no consequence – a Cinderella figure in a mansion of the rich and selfish. Fanny is shy, frail and physically timid, but she is not a moral coward. She learns to bear her lot with dignity, and to hold fast to what she believes. By volume three, Fanny is at last the centre of her own story. Mansfield Park is not just a love story, it is a life story. Championed by Ruvani Ranasinha, professor of global literature, King’s College London Emma Woodhouse is Jane Austen’s most vividly realised, proto-feminist heroine. Witty, clever and attractive, Emma is supremely self-confident and flawed. She challenges every expectation of female propriety and is full of contradictions: self-centred yet deeply attached to her hypochondriac, indulgent father; snobbish but kind. Emma revels in meddling in the romantic lives of others, especially her protégée, Harriet Smith. When her carefully laid plans unravel, the busybody makes mortifying mistakes and learns self-knowledge: “It darted through her with the speed of an arrow, that Mr Knightley must marry no-one but herself!” All Austen’s novels are shot through with the awareness of the role of wealth and class in marriage. But Emma – “an heiress of thirty thousand pounds” – is free from the intense competition among the women for young men with positions and prospects. At the same time, she attracts men like Mr Elton seeking women with landed connections and dowries. This is why the novel both responds to Austen’s historical moment and speaks to our own. Championed by Octavia Cox, departmental lecturer in English literature, University of Oxford Northanger Abbey is a riot of jokes. Nobody and nothing is spared: not the heroine, convention, society – even readers. There’s everything marvellous you’d expect from an Austen novel (sharp satire of patriarchy and socioeconomic weaponisation, laughter at human absurdity and pompousness, beautifully wrought witty expression, a rollicking good yarn, irony), but with extra sass. Its bombastic intrusive authorial narrative voice (perhaps the closest we get to Austen’s own), constantly makes in-jokes with readers about the action. It’s Austen’s most meta-fictional text, playing with readers’ expectations about novels (for example, joking that her novel, ironically, “is a new circumstance in romance” despite depicting nothing “new in common life”). Its “defence of the novel” passage is a proto-feminist rallying call-to-arms for female authors to celebrate each other’s work. Northanger Abbey’s meta-fictionality reveals much about Austen’s aim and style as an author, making it a must-read for all Austen-lovers. Oh, and it’s funny. Damned funny. Championed by Richard de Ritter, lecturer in English literature, University of Leeds Persuasion contains the greatest love letter in all English literature. It is the culmination of a slow-burning romance between the heroine, Anne Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, the man she has loved for eight long years. “You pierce my soul,” Wentworth writes to Anne with striking vulnerability: “I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late.” (Spoiler: he is not too late.) The brilliance of Persuasion lies in the depiction of its complex heroine. At 27, Anne Elliot is older and wiser than Austen’s earlier protagonists. Disregarded by her comically narcissistic family, the depth of Anne’s personality is revealed by Austen’s prose style, which is at its most luminous and expressive. Readers are plunged into the mind of the novel’s heroine. We witness her innermost thoughts and feelings as she negotiates the awkwardness, excitement and, finally, the sheer joy of embracing a future with Wentworth. Persuasion is the final novel that Austen completed before her death in 1817: she was at the peak of her powers. It is her most moving and her greatest work.

Title: Fulfillment Compared: Amazon, Walmart, Shopify

Time Published: 2025-08-27T09:36:45Z

Ecommerce operators tired of picking, packing, and posting parcels can turn to massive marketplaces and the leading ecommerce platform for help. For years, Fulfillment by Amazon, Walmart Fulfillment Services, and the Shopify Fulfillment Network have helped sellers store inventory, ship orders, and even manage returns. The services share a common purpose of providing ecommerce order fulfillment but differ in structure, at least a little. Understanding those differences starts with a closer look at how each network works. FBA, SFN, and WFS aim to make ecommerce fulfillment fast and easy. Launched in 2006, FBA is the most recognized third-party fulfillment option on this list owing to its close association with the company’s marketplace. FBA’s most important feature may be exposure. Items sold on the Amazon Marketplace and fulfilled through FBA display the Prime badge on Amazon.com. The badge is important because about 75% of U.S. Amazon shoppers are Prime members and likely filter for Prime-eligible products. Using FBA begins in Seller Central. Merchants prep inventory to Amazon’s specifications and ship it to designated warehouses. Amazon distributes stock across its network and automatically routes orders. When customers make a purchase, Amazon employees pick, pack, and ship the order, which is often delivered within one to two days. Amazon also processes returns, with refunds issued directly to the customer. Amazon’s Multi-Channel Fulfillment allows retailers to use Amazon’s warehouses, staff, and shipping network to fulfill orders placed on external platforms such as eBay or their own websites. Walmart launched its FBA competitor, Walmart Fulfillment Services, in 2020 at the height of Covid. The timing was coincidental as the retail giant had planned the start, but the pandemic-induced ecommerce surge that followed might have helped get things rolling. Functionally, WFS operates similarly to FBA. Sellers apply through Walmart’s Seller Center. Once approved, those merchants send inventory to WFS warehouses. Walmart’s system routes orders automatically. There is even a “Fulfilled by Walmart” badge with a two-day delivery promise for Walmart Marketplace items. Two WFS differences stand out relative to FBA: returns and price. Orders placed on the Walmart Marketplace and fulfilled with WFS are returnable to nearly any of Walmart’s physical locations, offering a level of customer convenience. And WFS claims to be approximately 15% less expensive than FBA despite having a higher base rate, the apparent difference coming from additional fees for setup, storage, size, and similar. Walmart claims that WFS is about 15% cheaper than other marketplace fulfillment services. WFS is primarily for Walmart Marketplace sellers, but in September 2024, WFS began its own multichannel fulfillment service similar to Amazon’s MCF. Thus sellers can use WFS in combination with an internet store or other ecommerce channels. Essentially an app, Shopify Fulfillment Network makes it relatively easy for merchants to process Shopify orders through third-party fulfillment services. Sellers enable the SFN app in Shopify’s admin, connect catalogs, and send inventory to partner warehouses. Orders from Shopify and other connected channels flow into the system, which routes shipments to the closest node. Fulfillment partners store inventory and manage returns. Perhaps the key difference between SFN and FBA or WFS is control. A Shopify store owns its own brand and customer relationships. In contrast, FBA and WFS customers may have purchased directly from Amazon or Walmart, and they will most certainly recognize the brands’ packaging when the orders arrive. SFN has an eventful history. Shopify launched the service in 2019 with a $1 billion investment. In 2022, it acquired Deliverr for $2 billion, only to eventually sell it to Flexport, which became the default in-app service. Since the sale, Shopify sellers using SFN can work with several leading fulfillment providers, including ShipBob, Shipfusion, ShipMonk, DHL Fulfillment, and Amazon MCF. Merchants can utilize custom packaging with the SFN, manage multiple channels from a single dashboard, and display Shopify’s Shop Promise badge with two- to three-day deliveries. FBA, WFS, and SFN all offer comprehensive ecommerce fulfillment, and in at least a few ways are interchangeable. The services are not mutually exclusive. A single store can utilize FBA and WFS for its respective marketplace channels, while employing SFN for orders via Shopify and its TikTok shop. The takeaway? There are many excellent options for ecommerce order fulfillment. Share this article: Copyright © 2005 - 2025. Practical Ecommerce® is a registered trademark of Confluence Distribution, Inc.

Title: Why investors are on tenterhooks for Nvidia’s latest earnings report
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/why-investors-are-on-tenterhooks-for-nvidias-latest-earnings-report

The US chip giant is considered a bellwether for both the AI industry and Wall Street. By Erin Hale Chip giant Nvidia is set to release its latest earnings report – and the results could move the entire US stock market. Over the past two years, the chipmaker has risen to become the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of more than $4 trillion. When Nvidia announces its earnings on Wednesday, investors will get to see how the tech giant has been faring amid the tumult of President Donald Trump’s trade salvoes and concerns about whether artificial intelligence has been overhyped. Nvidia specialises in making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI, including the Blackwell B200, marketed as the world’s most powerful chip. The California-based company’s chips have become essential to the world’s largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, since AI exploded into the mainstream with the release of OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. The company’s portfolio also includes data centres and gaming. Nvidia posted annual revenue of $130.5bn for the last fiscal year, which ended in late January. Analysts will be examining various metrics, including the company’s quarterly revenue. Nvidia’s revenue has been growing at breakneck speed for the past several years, thanks to the AI boom and the surge in demand for its chips. Nvidia posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024, according to company filings. Since then, annual revenue growth has coasted in the high double digits. Last quarter, the company reported revenue of $44.1bn, a 69 percent increase from the same period a year ago. While such figures would be the envy of any company, the firm’s explosive performance has also raised questions about how long its stellar run can last. In advance of its forthcoming earnings report – which covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 – Nvidia has said it expects revenue of $45bn plus or minus 2 percent. Analysts have predicted revenue of up to $46bn, or 53 percent growth year-on-year. The earnings report is also expected to show signs of whiplash from the Trump administration’s tariff war. In April, Trump banned Nvidia from selling its H20 chip – specially designed for the Chinese market – to China. At the time, Nvidia said the ban would cost the company $8bn. Trump later walked back the ban when Nvidia agreed to share 15 percent of its H20 chip sales with the US government, a deal that was finalised on August 11, two weeks after the end of its second quarter. As Silicon Valley pours billions into AI, some observers, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned whether there is a bubble. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is, yes,” Altman told The Verge in an interview earlier this month. He is not the only one who is worried. Analysts have drawn parallels to the collapse of the “Nifty Fifty” in the 1970s, said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management in the United Kingdom. The Nifty Fifty was a group of 50 of the most valuable companies in the US, including Xerox and IBM. Though highly profitable, the firms became highly overvalued in the late 1960s and early 70s. When the bubble burst following the 1973-74 stock market crash, the value of Nifty Fifty stocks fell by more than 50 percent. “They were fantastic companies, but they were trading on the wrong price,” Sai told Al Jazeera. “This is the old notion of you could be a great company, but not a great stock if the price is wrong.” Five decades later, some investors are asking whether the “Magnificent Seven” – Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla – could be overvalued as well. Valuations have soared into the trillions of dollars on the back of the AI boom, although there is some divergence within the group, with Apple and Tesla faring less well recently. Amazon recently said it expects to spend $85bn on AI over the next year, while Microsoft predicts it will spend $100bn. AI has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise slowing economy that has been undergoing upheaval since Trump took office. “Growth is dwindling in other sectors, but there is this very small, niche, concentrated pocket of hyper growth,” Sai said. “This suddenly becomes a much bigger contributor to US GDP growth than it would have been in a normal phase of the cycle.” Corporate spending on AI has been likened to an arms race, but tech giants – and Nvidia customers – will also sooner or later need to show investors that their betting on the sector will lead to profits. US tech giants are already facing challenges from companies like China’s DeepSeek, which made global headlines in January when it unveiled a powerful but much cheaper AI model. So far, innovation does not appear to be translating into higher returns. In a recent survey by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 95 percent of enterprises looked at reported no return on their AI investments despite the billions ploughed into the sector. Because of its sky-high valuation, Nvidia alone makes up almost 8 percent of the S&P500 – the benchmark index of 500 top companies listed on the US stock market. That means Nvidia’s earnings have the potential to have a significant impact, good or bad, on the stock market as a whole. Big movements in Nvidia’s stock price have triggered swings in the S&P 500 of 1 percent or more in the past. After Nvidia’s earnings results in February sent its share price down more than 8 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Editor's Note: For those of you reading via email, I recommend opening this in a browser so you can use the Table of Contents. This is my longest newsletter - a 16,000-word-long opus - and if you like it, please subscribe to my premium newsletter. Thanks for reading! In the last two years I've written no less than 500,000 words, with many of them dedicated to breaking both existent and previous myths about the state of technology and the tech industry itself. While I feel no resentment — I really enjoy writing, and feel privileged to be able to write about this and make money doing so — I do feel that there is a massive double standard between those perceived as "skeptics" and "optimists." To be skeptical of AI is to commit yourself to near-constant demands to prove yourself, and endless nags of "but what about?" with each one — no matter how small — presented as a fact that defeats any points you may have. Conversely, being an "optimist" allows you to take things like AI 2027 — which I will fucking get to — seriously to the point that you can write an entire feature about fan fiction in the New York Times and nobody will bat an eyelid. In any case, things are beginning to fall apart. Two of the actual reporters at the New York Times (rather than a "columnist") reported out last week that Meta is yet again "restructuring" its AI department for the fourth time, and that it’s considering "downsizing the A.I. division overall," which sure doesn't seem like something you'd do if you thought AI was the future. Meanwhile, the markets are also thoroughly spooked by an MIT study covered by Fortune that found that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing, and though MIT NANDA has now replaced the link to the study with a Google Form to request access, you can find the full PDF here, in the kind of move that screams "PR firm wants to try and set up interviews." Not for me, thanks! In any case, the report is actually grimmer than Fortune made it sound, saying that "95% of organizations are getting zero return [on generative AI]." The report says that "adoption is high, but transformation is low," adding that "...few industries show the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as new market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer behavior." Yet the most damning part was the "Five Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise," which is probably the most wilting takedown of this movement I've ever seen: These are brutal, dispassionate points that directly deal with the most common boosterisms. Generative AI isn't transforming anything, AI isn't replacing anyone, enterprises are trying to adopt generative AI but it doesn't fucking work, and the thing holding back AI is the fact it doesn't fucking work. This isn't a case where "the enterprise" is suddenly going to save these companies, because the enterprise already tried, and it isn't working. An incorrect read of the study has been that the "learning gap" that makes these things less useful, when the study actually says that "...the fundamental gap that defines the GenAI divide [is that users resist tools that don't adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers when systems can't remember." This isn't something you learn your way out of. The products don't do what they're meant to do, and people are realizing it. Nevertheless, boosters will still find a way to twist this study to mean something else. They'll claim that AI is still early, that the opportunity is still there, that we "didn't confirm that the internet or smartphones were productivity boosting," or that we're in "the early days" of AI, somehow, three years and hundreds of billions and thousands of articles in. I'm tired of having the same arguments with these people, and I'm sure you are too. No matter how much blindly obvious evidence there is to the contrary they will find ways to ignore it. They continually make smug comments about people "wishing things would be bad" or suggesting you are stupid — and yes, that is their belief! — for not believing generative AI is disruptive. Today, I’m going to give you the tools to fight back against the AI boosters in your life. I’m going to go into the generalities of the booster movement — the way they argue, the tropes they cling to, and the ways in which they use your own self-doubt against you. They’re your buddy, your boss, a man in a gingham shirt at Epic Steakhouse who won't leave you the fuck alone, a Redditor, a writer, a founder or a simple con artist — whoever the booster in your life is, I want you to have the words to fight them with. So, this is my longest newsletter ever, and I built it for quick reference - and, for the first time, gave you a Table of Contents. So, an AI booster is not, in many cases, an actual fan of artificial intelligence. People like Simon Willison or Max Woolf who actually work with LLMs on a daily basis don’t see the need to repeatedly harass everybody, or talk down to them about their unwillingness to pledge allegiance to the graveyard smash of generative AI. In fact, the closer I’ve found somebody to actually building things with LLMs, the less likely they are to emphatically argue that I’m missing out by not doing so myself. No, the AI booster is symbolically aligned with generative AI. They are fans in the same way that somebody is a fan of a sports team, their houses emblazoned with every possible piece of tat they can find, their Sundays living and dying by the success of the team, except even fans of the Dallas Cowboys have a tighter grasp on reality. Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are two of the most notable boosters, and — as I’ll get into later in this piece — neither of them have a consistent or comprehensive knowledge of AI. Nevertheless, they will insist that “everybody is using AI for everything” — a statement that even a booster should realize is incorrect based on the actual abilities of the models. But that’s because it isn’t about what’s actually happening, it’s about allegiance. AI symbolizes something to the AI booster — a way that they’re better than other people, that makes them superior because they (unlike “cynics” and “skeptics”) are able to see the incredible potential in the future of AI, but also how great it is today, though they never seem to be able to explain why outside of “it replaced search for me!” and “I use it to draw connections between articles I write,” which is something I do without AI using my fucking brain. Boosterism is a kind of religion, interested in finding symbolic “proof” that things are getting “better” in some indeterminate way, and that anyone that chooses to believe otherwise is ignorant. I’ll give you an example. Thomas Ptacek’s “My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts” was catnip for boosters — a software engineer using technical terms like “interact with Git” and “MCP,” vague charts, and, of course, an extremely vague statement that says hallucinations aren’t a problem: Is it? Anyway, my favourite part of the blog is this: Nobody projects more than an AI booster. They thrive on the sense they’re oppressed and villainized after years of seemingly every outlet claiming they’re right regardless of whether there’s any proof. They sneer and jeer and cry constantly that people are not showing adequate amounts of awe when an AI lab says “we did something in private, we can’t share it with you, but it’s so cool,” and constantly act as if they’re victims as they spread outright misinformation, either through getting things wrong or never really caring enough to check. Also, none of the booster arguments actually survive a thorough response, as Nik Suresh proved with his hilarious and brutal takedown of Ptacek’s piece. There are, I believe, some people who truly do love using LLMs, yet they are not the ones defending them. Ptacek’s piece drips with condescension, to the point that it feels like he’s trying to convince himself how good LLMs are, and because boosters are eternal victims, he wrote them a piece that they could send around to skeptics and say “heh, see?” without being able to explain why it was such a brutal takedown, mostly because they can’t express why other than “well this guy gets it!” One cannot be the big, smart genius that understands the glory and power of AI while also acting like a scared little puppy every time somebody tells them it sucks. In fact, that’s a great place to start. When you speak to an AI booster, you may get the instinct to shake them vigorously, or respond to their post by saying to do something with your something, or that they’re “stupid.” I understand the temptation, but you want to keep a head on a swivel — they thrive on victimisation. I’m sorry if you are an AI booster and this makes you feel bad. Please reflect on your work and how many times you’ve referred to somebody who didn’t understand AI in a manner that suggested they were ignorant, or tried to gaslight them by saying “AI was powerful” while providing no actionable ways in which it is. You cannot — and should not! — allow these people to act as if they are being victimized or “othered.” First and foremost: there are boosters at pretty much every major think tank, government agency and media outlet. It’s extremely lucrative being a booster. You’re showered with panel invites, access to executives, and are able to get headlines by saying how scared you are of the computer with ease. Being a booster is the easy path! Being a critic requires you to constantly have to explain yourself in a way that boosters never have to. If a booster says this to you, ask them to explain: There is no answer here, because this is not a coherent point of view. Boosters are more successful, get more perks and are in general better-treated than any critic. Fundamentally, these people exist in the land of the vague. They will drag you toward what's just on the horizon, but never quite define what the thing that dazzles you will be, or when it will arrive. Really, their argument comes down to one thought: you must get on board now, because at some point it'll be so good you'll feel stupid for not believing something that kind of sucks wouldn't be really good. If this line sounds familiar, it’s because you’ve heard it a million times before, most notably with crypto. They will make you define what would impress you, which isn't your job, in the same way finding a use case for them isn't your job. In fact, you are the customer! Here’s a great place to start: say “that’s a really weird thing to say!” It is peculiar to suggest that somebody doesn’t get how to use a product, and that we, as the customer, must justify ourselves to our own purchases. Make them justify their attitude. Just like any product, we buy software to serve a need. This is meant to be artificial *intelligence* — why is it so fucking stupid that I have to work out why it's useful? The answer, of course, is that it has no intellect, is not intelligent, and Large Language Models are being pushed up a mountain by a cadre of people who are either easily impressed or invested — either emotionally or financially — in its success due to the company they keep or their intentions for the world. If a booster suggests you “just don’t get it,” ask them to explain: Their use cases will likely be that AI has replaced search for them, that they use it for brainstorming or journaling, proof-reading an article, or looking through a big pile of their notes (or some other corpus of information) and summarizing it or pulling out insights. If a booster refers to AI “being powerful” and getting “more powerful,” ask them: The core of the AI booster’s argument is to make you feel bad. They will suggest you are intentionally not liking A.I. because you're a hater, or a cynic, or a Luddite. They will suggest that you are ignorant for not being amazed by ChatGPT. To be clear, anyone with a compelling argument doesn’t have to make you feel bad to convince you. The iPhone - and to be clear, I am referring to the concept of the smartphone and its utility, I am aware that there was marketing for the iPhone - didn’t need a fucking marketing campaign to explain why one device that can do a bunch of things you already find useful was good. You don't have to be impressed by ANYTHING by default, and any product — especially software — designed to make you feel stupid for "not getting it" is poorly designed. ChatGPT is the ultimate form of Silicon Valley Sociopathy — you must do the work to find the use cases, and thank them for being given the chance to do so. A.I. is not even good, reliable software! It resembles the death of the art of technology — inconsistent and unreliable by definition, inefficient by design, financially ruinous, and ADDS to the cognitive load of the user by requiring them to be ever-vigilant. So, here’s a really easy way to deal with this: if a booster ever suggests you are stupid or ignorant, ask them why it’s necessary to demean you to get their point across! Even if you are unable to argue on a technical level, make them explain why the software itself can’t convince you. Boosters will do everything they can to pull you off course. If you say that none of these companies make money, they’ll say it’s the early days. If you say AI companies burn billions, they’ll say the cost of inference is coming down. If you say the industry is massively overbuilding, they’ll say that this is actually just like the dot com boom and that the infrastructure will be picked up and used in the future. If you say there are no real use cases, they’ll say that ChatGPT has 700 million weekly users. Every time there’s the same god damn arguments, so I’ve sat down and written as many of them as I can think of. Print this and feed it to your local booster today. Anytime a booster says “AI will,” tell them to stop and explain what AI can do, and if they insist, ask them both when to expect the things they’re talking about, and if they say “very soon,” ask them to be more specific. Get them to agree to a date, then call them on that date. There’s that “will” bullshit again. Agents don’t work! They don’t work at all. The term “agent” means, to quote Max Woolf, “a workflow where the LLM can make its own decisions, [such as in the case of] web search [where] the LLM is told “you can search the web if you need to” then can output “I should search the web” and do so.” Yet “agent” has now become a mythical creature that means “totally autonomous AI that can do an entire job.” if anyone tells you “agents are…” you should ask them to point to one. If they say “coding,” please demand that they explain how autonomous these things are, and if they say that they can “refactor entire codebases,” ask them what that means, and also laugh at them. Here’s a comprehensive rundown, but here’s a particularly important part: Long story short, agents are not autonomous, they do not replace jobs, they cannot “replace coders,” they are not going to do so because probabilistic models are a horrible means of taking precise actions, and almost anyone who brings up agents as a booster is either misinformed or in the business of misinformation. Let's start with a really simple question: what does this actually mean? In many cases, I think they're referring to AI as being "like the early days of the internet." "The early days of the internet" can refer to just about anything. Are we talking about dial-up? DSL? Are we talking about the pre-platform days when people accessed it via Compuserve or AOL? Yes, yes, I remember that article from Newsweek, I already explained it here: In any case, one guy saying that the internet won't be big doesn't mean a fucking thing about generative AI and you are a simpleton if you think it does. One guy being wrong in some way is not a response to my work. I will crush you like a bug. If your argument is that the early internet required expensive Sun Microsystems servers to run, Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs addressed that by saying that the costs "pale in comparison," adding that we also didn't need to expand our power grid to build the early Web. This is a straight-up lie. Sorry! Also, as Jim Covello noted, there were hundreds of presentations in the early 2000s that included roadmaps that accurately fit how smartphones rolled out, and that no such roadmap exists for generative AI. The iPhone was also an immediate success as a thing that people paid for, with Apple selling four million units in the space of six months. Hell, in 2006 (the year before the iPhone launch), there was an estimated 17.7 million worldwide smartphone shipments (mostly from BlackBerry and other companies building on Windows Mobile, with Palm vacuuming up the crumbs), though to be generous to the generative AI boosters, I’ll disregard those. The original Attention Is All You Need paper — the one that kicked off the transformer-based Large Language Model era — was published in June 2017. ChatGPT launched in November 2022. Nevertheless, if we're saying "early days" here, we should actually define what that means. As I mentioned above, people paid for the iPhone immediately, despite it being a device that was completely and utterly new. While there was a small group of consumers that might have used similar devices (like the iPAQ), this was a completely new kind of computing, sold at a premium, requiring you to have a contract with a specific carrier (Cingular, now known as AT&T). Conversely, ChatGPT's "annualized" revenue in December 2023 was $1.6 billion (or $133 million a month), for a product that had, by that time, raised over $10 billion, and while we don't know what OpenAI lost in 2023, reports suggest it burned over $5 billion in 2024. Big tech has spent over $500 billion in capital expenditures in the last 18 months, and all told — between investments of cloud credits and infrastructure — will likely sink over $600 billion by year's-end. The "early days" of the internet were defined not by its lack of investment or attention, but by its obscurity. Even in 2000 — around the time of the dot-com bubble — only 52% of US adults used the internet, and it would take another 19 years for 90% of US adults to do so. These early days were also defined by its early functionality. The internet would become so much more because of the things that hyper-connectivity allowed us to do, and both faster internet connections and the ability to host software in the cloud would change, well, everything. We could define what “better” would mean, and make reasonable predictions about what people could do on a “better” internet. Yet even in those early days, it was obvious why you were using the internet, and how it might grow from there. One did not have to struggle to explain why buying a book online might be useful, or why a website might be a quicker reference than having to go to a library, or why downloading a game or a song might be a good idea. While habits might have needed adjusting, it was blatantly obvious what the value of the early internet was. It's also unclear when the early days of the internet ended. Only 44% of US adults had access to broadband internet by 2006. Were those the early days of the internet? The answer is "no," and that this point is brought up by people with a poor grasp of history and a flimsy attachment to reality. The early days of the internet were very, very different to any associated tech boom since, and we need to stop making the comparison. The internet also grew in a vastly different information ecosystem. Generative AI has had the benefit of mass media — driven by the internet! — along with social media (and social pressure) to "adopt AI" for multiple years. According to Pew, as of mid-June 2025, 34% of US adults have used ChatGPT, with 79% saying they had "heard at least a little about it." Furthermore, ChatGPT has always had a free version. On top of that, a study from May 2023 found that over 10,900 news headlines mentioned ChatGPT between November, 2022 and March, 2023, and a BrandWatch report found that in the first five months of its release, ChatGPT received over 9.24 million mentions on social media. Nearly 80% of people have heard of ChatGPT, and over a quarter of Americans have used it. If we're defining "the early days" based on consumer exposure, that ship has sailed. If we're defining "the early days" by the passage of time, it's been 8 years since Attention Is All You Need, and three since ChatGPT came out. While three years might not seem like a lot of time, the whole foundation of an "early days" argument is that in the early days, things do not receive the venture funding, research, attention, infrastructural support or business interest necessary to make them "big." In 2024, nearly 33% of all global venture funding went to artificial intelligence, and according to The Information, AI startups have raised over $40 billion in 2025 alone, with Statista adding that AI absorbed 71% of VC funding in Q1 2025. These numbers also fail to account for the massive infrastructure that companies like OpenAI and Anthropic don't have to pay for. The limitations of the early internet were two-fold: In generative AI's case, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have built out the "fiber optic cables" for Large Language Models. OpenAI and Anthropic have everything they need. They have (even if they say otherwise) plenty of compute, access to the literal greatest minds in the field, the constant attention of the media and global governments, and effectively no regulations or restrictions stopping them from training their models on the works of millions of people, or destroying our environment. They have already had this support. OpenAI was allowed to burn half a billion dollars on a training run for GPT-4.5 and 5. If anything, the massive amounts of capital have allowed us to massively condense the time in which a bubble goes from "possible" to "bursting and washing out a bunch of people," because the tech industry has such a powerful follower culture that only one or two unique ideas can exist at one time. The "early days" argument hinges on obscurity and limited resources, something that generative AI does not get to whine about. Companies that make effectively no revenue can raise $500 million to do the same AI coding bullshit that everybody else does. In simpler terms, these companies are flush with cash, have all the attention and investment they could possibly need, and are still unable to create a product with a defined, meaningful, mass-market use case. In fact, I believe that thanks to effectively infinite resources, we've speed-run the entire Large Language Model era, and we're nearing the end. These companies got what they wanted. Bonus trick: ask them to tell you what “the fiber boom” was. So, a little history. The "fiber boom" began after the telecommunications act of 1996 deregulated large parts of America's communications infrastructure, creating a massive boom — a $500 billion one to be precise, primarily funded with debt: In one sense, explaining what happened to the telecom sector is very simple: the growth in capacity has vastly outstripped the growth in demand. In the five years since the 1996 bill became law, telecommunications companies poured more than $500 billion into laying fiber optic cable, adding new switches, and building wireless networks. So much long-distance capacity was added in North America, for example, that no more than two percent is currently being used. With the fixed costs of these new networks so high and the marginal costs of sending signals over them so low, it is not a surprise that competition has forced prices down to the point where many firms have lost the ability to service their debts. No wonder we have seen so many bankruptcies and layoffs. This piece, written in 2002, is often cited as a defense against the horrifying capex associated with generative AI, as that fiber optic cable has been useful for delivering high-speed internet. Useful, right? This period was also defined by a gluttony of over-investment, ridiculous valuations and outright fraud. In any case, this is not remotely the same thing and anyone making this point needs to learn the very fucking basics of technology. GPUs are built to shove massive amounts of compute into one specific function again and again, like generating the output of a model (which, remember, mostly boils down to complex maths). Unlike CPUs, a GPU can't easily change tasks, or handle many little distinct operations, meaning that these things aren't going to be adopted for another mass-scale use case. In simpler terms, this was not an infrastructure buildout. The GPU boom is a heavily-centralized, capital expenditure-funded asset bubble where a bunch of chips will sit in warehouses waiting for somebody to make up a use case for them, and if an endearing one existed, we'd already have it because we already have all the fucking GPUs. You are describing fan fiction. AI 2027 is fan fiction. Anyone who believes in it is a mark! It doesn’t matter if all of the people writing the fan fiction are scientists, or that they all have “the right credentials.” They themselves say that AI 2027 is a “guess,” an “extrapolation” (guess) with “expert feedback” (someone editing your fan fiction), and involves “experience at OpenAI” (there are people that worked on the shows they write fan fiction about). I am not going to go line-by-line to cut this apart anymore than I am going to write a lengthy takedown of someone’s erotic Banjo Kazooie story, because both are fictional. The entire premise of this nonsense is that at one point someone invents a self-learning “agent” that teaches itself stuff, and it does a bunch of other stuff as a result, with different agents with different numbers after them. There is no proof this is possible, nobody has done it, nobody will do it. AI 2027 was written specifically to fool people that wanted to be fooled, with big charts and the right technical terms used to lull the credulous into a wet dream and New York Times column where one of the writers folds their hands and looks worried. It was also written to scare people that are already scared. It makes big, scary proclamations, with tons of links to stuff that looks really legitimate but, when you piece it all together, is still fan fiction. My personal favourite part is “Mid 2026: China Wakes Up,” which involves China’s intelligence agencies trying to steal OpenBrain’s agent (no idea who this company could be referring to, I’m stumped!), before the headline of “AI Takes Some Jobs” after OpenBrain released a model oh god I am so bored even writing up this tripe! Sarah Lyons put it well, arguing that AI 2027 (and AI in general) is no different from the spurious “spectral evidence” used to accuse someone of being a witch during the Salem Witch Trials: Anyway, AI 2027 is fan fiction, nothing more, and just because it’s full of fancy words and has five different grifters on its byline doesn’t mean anything. Bonus trick: Ask them to explain whether things have actually got cheaper, and if they say they have, ask them why there are no profitable AI companies. If they say “they’re currently in growth stage,” ask them why there are no profitable AI companies. At this point they should try and kill you. In an interview on a podcast from earlier in the year, journalist Casey Newton said the following about my work: Newton then says — several octaves higher, showing how mad he isn't — that "[he] thought what [he] said was very civil" and that there are "things that are true and there are things that are false, like you can choose which ones you wanna believe." I am not going to be so civil. Other than the fact that Casey refers to "micro-innovations" (?) and "DeepSeek being on a curve that was expected," he makes — as many do — two very big mistakes, ones that I personally would not have said in a sentence that begun with suggesting that I knew how the technology works. Inference — and I've gotten this one wrong in the past too! — is everything that happens from when you put a prompt in to generate an output. It's when an AI, based on your prompt, "infers" meaning. To be more specific, and quoting Google, "...machine learning inference is the process of running data points into a machine learning model to calculate an output such as a single numerical score." Casey will try and weasel out of this one and say this is what he meant. It wasn't. Casey, like many people who talk about stuff without learning about it first, is likely referring to the fact that the price of tokens for some models has gone down in some cases. The problem, however, is that these are raw token costs, not actual expressions or evaluations of token burn in a practical setting. Worse still… Well, the cost of inference actually went up. In an excellent blog for Kilocode, Ewa Szyszka explained: Token consumption per application grew a lot because models allowed for longer context windows and bigger suggestions from the models. The combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years. To explain in really simple terms, while the costs of old models may have decreased, new models cost about the same, and the "reasoning" that these models do actually burn way, way more tokens. When these new models "reason," they break a user's input and break into component parts, then run inference on each one of those parts. When you plug an LLM into an AI coding environment, it will naturally burn an absolute ton of tokens, in part because of the large amount of information you have to load into the prompt (and the "context window," or the information you load in with your prompt, with token burn increasing with the size of that information), and in part because generating code is inference-intensive. In fact, the inference costs are so severe that Szyszka says that "...combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years." I refuse to let this point go, because people love to say "the cost of inference is going down" when the cost of inference has increased, and they do so to a national audience, all while suggesting I am wrong somehow. I am not wrong. In fact, software development influencer Theo Browne recently put out a video called "I was wrong about AI costs (they keep going up)," which he breaks down as follows: The price drops have, for the most part, stopped. See the below chart from The Information: You cannot, at this point, fairly evaluate whether a model is "cheaper" just based on its cost-per-tokens, because reasoning models are inherently built to use more tokens to create an output. Reasoning models are also the only way that model developers have been able to improve the efficacy of new models, using something called "test-time compute" to burn extra tokens to complete a task. And in basically anything you're using today, there's gonna be some sort of reasoning model, especially if you're coding. The cost of inference has gone up. Statements otherwise are purely false, and are the opinion of somebody who does not know what he's talking about. ...maybe? It sure isn't trending that way, nor has it gone down yet. I also predict that there's going to be a sudden realization in the media that it's going up, which has kind of already started. The Information had a piece recently about it, where they note that Intuit paid $20 million to Azure last year (primarily for access to OpenAI's models), and is on track to spend $30 million this year, which "outpaces the company's revenue growth in the same period, raising questions about how sustainable the spending is and how much of the cost it can pass along to customers." The problem here is that the architecture underlying Large Language Models is inherently unreliable. I imagine OpenAI's introduction of the router to ChatGPT-5 is an attempt to moderate both the costs of the model chosen and reduce the amount of exposure to reasoning models for simple queries — though Altman was boasting on August 10th about the "significant increase" in both free and paid users' exposure to reasoning models. Worse still, a study written up by VentureBeat found that open-weight models burn between 1.5 to 4 times more tokens, in part due to a lack of token efficiency, and in particular thanks to — you guessed it! — reasoning models: The findings challenge a prevailing assumption in the AI industry that open-source models offer clear economic advantages over proprietary alternatives. While open-source models typically cost less per token to run, the study suggests this advantage can be “easily offset if they require more tokens to reason about a given problem.” And models keep getting bigger and more expensive, too. Because model developers hit a wall of diminishing returns, and the only way to make their models do more was to make them burn more tokens to generate a more accurate response (this is a very simple way of describing reasoning, a thing that OpenAI launched in September 2024 and others followed). As a result, all the "gains" from "powerful new models" come from burning more and more tokens. The cost-per-million-token number is no longer an accurate measure of the actual costs of generative AI, because it's much, much harder to tell how many tokens a reasoning model may burn, and it varies (as Theo Browne noted) from model to model. In any case, there really is no changing this path. They are out of ideas. So, I've heard this argument maybe 50 times in the last year, to the point that I had to talk about it in my July 2024 piece "How Does OpenAI Survive." Nevertheless, people make a few points about Uber and AI that I think are fundamentally incorrect, and I'll break them down for you. I've seen this argument a lot, and it's one that's both ahistorical and alarmingly ignorant of the very basics of society. So, OpenAI got a $200 million defense contract with an "estimated completion date of July 2026," and is selling ChatGPT Enterprise to the US government for a dollar a year (along with Anthropic, which sells access to Claude for the same price, Even Google is undercutting them, selling Gemini access at 47 cents for a year). You're probably reading that and saying "oh no, that means the government has paid them now, they're never going away," and I cannot be clear enough that you believing this is the intention of these deals. These are built specifically to make you feel like these things are never going away. This is also an attempt to get "in" with the government at a rate that makes "trying" these models a no-brainer. ...and??????? "The government is going to have cheap access to AI software" does not mean that "the government relies on AI software." Every member of the government having access to ChatGPT — something that is not even necessarily the case! — does not make this software useful, let alone essential, and if OpenAI burns a bunch of money "making it work for them," it still won't be essential, because Large Language Models are not actually that useful for doing stuff! Uber used lobbyist Bradley Tusk to steamroll local governments into allowing Uber to operate in their cities, but Tusk did not have to convince local governments that Uber was useful or have to train people how to use it. Uber's "too big to fail" moment was that local cabs kind of fucking sucked just about everywhere. Did you ever try and take a yellow cab from Downtown Manhattan to Hoboken New Jersey? Or Brooklyn? Or Queens? Did you ever try to pay with a credit card? How about trying to get a cab outside of a major metropolitan area? Do you remember how bad that was? I am not glorifying Uber the company, but the experience that Uber replaced was very, very bad. As a result, Uber did become too big to fail, because people now rely upon it because the old system sucked. Uber used its masses of venture capital to keep prices low to get people used to it too, but the fundamental experience was better than calling a cab company and hoping that they showed up. I also want to be clear this is not me condoning Uber, take public transport if you can! To be clear, Uber has created a new kind of horrifying, extractive labor practice which deprives people of benefits and dignity, paying off academics to help the media gloss over the horrors of its platform. It is also now having to increase prices. What, exactly, is the "essential" experience of generative AI? What essential experience are we going to miss if ChatGPT disappears tomorrow? And on an enterprise or governmental level: what exactly are these tools doing for governments that would make removing them so painful? What use cases? What outcomes? Uber's "essential" nature is that millions of people use it in place of regular taxis, and it effectively replaced decrepit, exploitative systems like the yellow cab medallions in New York with its own tech-enabled exploitation system that, nevertheless, worked far better for the user. Sidenote: although I acknowledge that the disruption that Uber brought to the medallion system had horrendous consequences for the owners of said medallions — some of whom had paid more than a million dollars for the privilege to drive a New York taxi cab, and were burdened under mountains of debt. There is no such use case with ChatGPT, or any other generative AI system. You cannot point to one use case that is anywhere near as necessary as cabs in cities, and indeed the biggest use cases — things like brainstorming and search — are either easily replaced by any other commoditized LLM or literally already exist with Google Search. Nope! Sorry, this is a really simple one. These data centers are not, in and of themselves, driving much economic growth other than in the costs of building them. As I've discussed again and again, there's maybe $40 billion in revenue and no profit coming out of these companies. There isn't any economic growth! They're not holding up anything! These data centers, once built, also create very little economic activity. They don't create jobs, they take up massive amounts of land and utilities, and they piss off and poison their neighbors. If anything, letting these things die would be a political win. There is no "great loss" associated with the death of the Large Language Model era. Taking away Uber would genuinely affect people's ability to get places. So, the classic (and wrong!) argument about OpenAI and companies like OpenAI is that "Uber burned a bunch of money and is now "cash-flow positive" or "profitable." Let's talk about raw losses, and where people are making this assumption. Uber lost $24.9 billion in the space of four years (2019 to 2022), in part because of the billions it was spending on sales and marketing and R&D — $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion respectively in 2019 alone. It also massively subsidized the cost of rides — which is why prices had to increase — and spent heavily on driver recruitment, burning cash to get scale, the classic Silicon Valley way. This is absolutely nothing like how Large Language Models are growing, and I am tired of defending this point. OpenAI and Anthropic burn money primarily through compute costs and specialized talent. These costs are increasing, especially with the rush to hire every single AI scientist at the most expensive price possible. There are also essential, immovable costs that neither OpenAI nor Anthropic have to shoulder — the construction of the data centers necessary to train and run inference for their models, which I will get to in a little bit. Yes, Uber raised $33.5 billion (through multiple rounds of post-IPO debt, though it raised about $25 billion in actual funding). Yes, Uber burned an absolute ass-ton of money. Yes, Uber has scale. But Uber was not burning money as a means of making its product functional or useful. Furthermore, the costs associated with Uber — and its capital expenditures from 2019 through 2024 were around $2.2 billion! — are miniscule compared to the actual costs of OpenAI and Anthropic. Both OpenAI and Anthropic lost around $5 billion in 2024, but their infrastructure was entirely paid for by either Microsoft, Google or Amazon. While we don't know how much of this infrastructure is specifically for OpenAI or Anthropic, as the largest model developers it's fair to assume that a large chunk — at least 30% — of Amazon and Microsoft's capital expenditures have been to support these loads (I leave out Google as it's unclear whether it’s expanded its infrastructure for Anthropic, but we know Amazon has done so). As a result, the true "cost" of OpenAI and Anthropic is at least ten times what Uber burned. Amazon spent $83 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects to spend $105 billion in 2025. Microsoft spent $55.6 billion in 2024 and expects to spend $80 billion this year. Based on my (conservative) calculations, the true "cost" of OpenAI is around $82 billion, and that only includes capex from 2024 onward, based on 30% of Microsoft's capex (as not everything has been invested yet in 2025, and OpenAI is not necessarily all of the capex) and the $41.4 billion of funding it’s received so far. The true cost of Anthropic is around $77.1 billion, including all its funding and 30% of Amazon's capex from the beginning of 2024. These are inexact comparisons, but the classic argument is that Uber "burned lots of money and worked out okay," when in fact the combined capital expenditures from 2024 onwards that are necessary to make Anthropic and OpenAI work are each — on their own — four times the amount Uber burned in over a decade. I also believe that these numbers are conservative. There's a good chance that Anthropic and OpenAI dominate the capex of Amazon and Microsoft, in part because what the fuck else are they buying all these GPUs for, as their own AI services don't seem to be making that much money at all. Anyway, to put it real simple, AI has burned more in the last two years than Uber burned in ten, Uber didn't burn money in the same way, didn't burn much by way of capital expenditures, didn't require massive amounts of infrastructure, and isn't remotely the same in any way, shape or form, other than it burned a lot of money — and that burning wasn’t because it was trying to build the core product, but rather trying to scale. I covered this in depth in the Hater's Guide To The AI Bubble, but the long and short of it is that AWS is a platform, a necessity with an obvious choice, and has burned about ten percent of what Amazon et. al has burned chasing generative AI, and had proven demand before building it. Also, AWS was break-even in three years. OpenAI was founded in fucking 2015, and even if you start from November 2022, by AWS standards it should be break-even! Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. As I’ve discussed in the past, this metric is basically “monthx12,” and while it’s a fine measure for high-gross-margin businesses like SaaS companies, it isn’t for AI. It doesn’t account for churn (when people leave). It also is a number intentionally used to make a company sound more successful — so you can say “$200 million annualized revenue” instead of “$16.6 million a month.” Also, if they’re saying this number, it’s likely that number isn’t consistent! Also: Simple answer: why have literally none of them done this yet? Why not one? Why? There’s that “will” bullshit, once again, always about the “will.” We do not know how thinking works in humans and thus cannot extrapolate it to a machine, and at the very least human beings have the ability to re-evaluate things and learn, a thing that LLMs cannot do and will never do. We do not know how to get to AGI. Sam Altman said in June that OpenAI was “now confident [they knew] how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.” In August, Altman said that AGI was “not a super useful term,” and that “the point of all this is it doesn’t really matter and it’s just this continuing exponential of model capability that we’ll rely on for more and more things.” So, yeah, total bullshit. Even Meta’s Chief AI Scientist says it isn’t possible with transformer-based models. We don’t know if AGI is possible, anyone claiming they do is lying. This, too, is hogwash, nothing different than your buddy’s friend’s uncle who works at Nintendo that says Mario is coming to PlayStation. Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati raised billions for companies with no product, let alone a product road map, and they did so because they saw a good opportunity for a grift and to throw a bunch of money at compute. Also: if someone from “deep within the AI industry” has told somebody “big things are coming,” they are doing so to con them or make them think they have privileged information. Ask for specifics. This argument is poised as a comeback to my suggestion that AI isn't particularly useful, a proof point that this movement is not inherently wasteful, or that there are, in fact, use cases for ChatGPT that are lasting, meaningful or important. I disagree. In fact, I believe ChatGPT — and LLMs in general — have been marketed based on lies of inference. Ironic, I know. I also have grander concerns and suspicions about what OpenAI considers a “user” and how it counts revenue, I’ll get into that later in the week on my premium newsletter, which you should subscribe to. Here’s a hint though: 500,000 of OpenAI’s “5 million business customers” are from its $15 million deal with Cal State University, which works out to around $2.50-a-user-a-month. It’s also started doing $1-a-month trials of its $30-a-month “Teams” subscription, and one has to wonder how many of those are counted in that total, and for how long. I do not know the scale of these offers, nor how long OpenAI has been offering them. A Redditor posted about the deal a few months ago, saying that OpenAI was offering up to 5 seats at once. In fact, I've found a few people talking about these deals, and even one adding that they were offered an annual $10-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscription, with one person saying a few weeks ago saying they'd seen people offered this deal for canceling their subscription. Suspicious. But there’s a greater problem at play. So, ChatGPT has 700 million weekly active users. OpenAI has yet to provide a definition — and yes, I've asked! — which means that an "active" user could be defined as somebody who has gone to ChatGPT once in the space of a week. This term is extremely flimsy, and doesn't really tell us much. Similarweb says that in July 2025 ChatGPT.com had 1.287 billion total visits, making it a very popular website. What do these facts actually mean, though? As I said previously, ChatGPT has had probably the most sustained PR campaign for anything outside of a presidency or a pop star. Every single article about AI mentions OpenAI or ChatGPT, every single feature launch — no matter how small — gets a slew of coverage. Every single time you hear "AI" you’re made to think of "ChatGPT” by a tech media that has never stopped to think about their role in hype, or their responsibility to their readers. And as this hype has grown, the publicity compounds, because the natural thing for a journalist to do when everybody is talking about something is to talk about it more. ChatGPT's immediate popularity may have been viral, but the media took the ball and ran with it, and then proceeded to tell people it did stuff it did not. People were pressured to try this service then under false pretenses, something that continues to this day. I'll give you an example. On March 15 2023, Kevin Roose of the New York Times would say that OpenAI's GPT-4 was "exciting and scary," exacerbating (his words!) "...the dizzy and vertiginous feeling I’ve been getting whenever I think about A.I. lately," wondering if he was experiencing "future shock," then described how it was an indeterminate level of "better" and something that immediately sounded ridiculous: In one test, conducted by an A.I. safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it — solving a Captcha test — without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The A.I. even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment. That doesn't sound remotely real! I went and looked up the paper, and here is the entire extent of what OpenAI shared: This safety card led to the perpetration of one of the earliest falsehoods — and most eagerly-parotted lies — that ChatGPT and generative AI is capable of "agentic" actions. Outlet after outlet — led by Kevin Roose — eagerly interpreted an entire series of events that took place that doesn't remotely make sense, starting with the fact that this is not something you can hire a Taskrabbit to do. Or, at the very least, without a contrived situation where you create an empty task and ask them to complete it. Why not use Mechanical Turk? Or Fiverr? They’ve tons of people offering this service! But I'm a curious little critter, so I went further and followed their citation to a link on METR's research page. It turns out that what actually happened was METR had a researcher copy paste the generated responses from the model and otherwise handle the entire interaction with Taskrabbit, and based on the plurality of "Taskrabbit contractors," it appears to have taken multiple tries. On top of that, it appears that OpenAI/METR were prompting the model on what to say, which kind of defeats the point. Emphases mine, and comments in [brackets]: It took me five whole minutes to find this piece — which is cited on the GPT-4 system card — read it, then write this piece. It did not require any technical knowledge other than the ability to read stuff. It is transparently, blatantly obvious that GPT-4 did not "hire" a Taskrabbit or, indeed, make any of these actions — it was prompted to, and they do not show the prompts they used, likely because they had to use so many of them. Anyone falling for this is a mark, and OpenAI should have gone out of its way to correct people. Instead, they sat back and let people publish outright misinformation. Roose, along with his co-host Casey Newton, would go on to describe this example at length on a podcast that week, describing an entire narrative where “the human actually gets suspicious” and “GPT 4 reasons out loud that it should not reveal that [it is] a robot,” at which point “the TaskRabbit solves the CAPTCHA.” During this conversation, Newton gasps and says “oh my god” twice, and when he asks Roose “how does the model understand that in order to succeed at this task, it has to deceive the human?” Roose responds “we don’t know, that is the unsatisfying answer,” and Newton laughs and states “we need to pull the plug. I mean, again, what?” Credulousness aside, the GPT-4 marketing campaign was incredibly effective, creating an aura that allowed OpenAI to take advantage of the vagueness of its offering as people — including members of the media — willfully filled in the blanks for them. Altman has never had to work to sell this product. Think about it — have you ever heard OpenAI tell you what ChatGPT can do, or gone to great lengths to describe its actual abilities? Even on OpenAI's own page for ChatGPT, the text is extremely vague: Scrolling down, you're told ChatGPT can "write, brainstorm, edit and explore ideas with you." It can "generate and debug code, automate repetitive tasks, and [help you] learn new APIs." With ChatGPT you can "learn something new...dive into a hobby...answer complex questions" and "analyze data and create charts." What repetitive tasks? Who knows. How am I learning? Unclear. It's got thinking built in! What that means is unclear, unexplained, and thus allows a user to incorrectly believe that ChatGPT has a brain. To be clear, I know what reasoning means, but this website does not attempt to explain what "thinking" means. You can also "offload complex tasks from start to finish with an agent," which can, according to OpenAI, "think and act, proactively choosing from a toolbox of agentic skills to complete tasks for you using its own computer." This is an egregious lie, employing the kind of weasel-wording that would be used to torture "I.R. Baboon" for an eternity. Precise in its vagueness, OpenAI's copy is honed to make reporters willing to simply write down whatever they see and interpret it in the most positive light. And thus the lie of inference began. What "ChatGPT" meant was muddied from the very beginning, and thus ChatGPT's actual outcomes have never been fully defined. What ChatGPT "could do" became a form of folklore — a non-specific form of "automation" that could "write code" and "generate copy and images," that can "analyze data," all things that are true but one can infer much greater meaning from. One can infer that "automation" means the automation of anything related to text, or that "write code" means "write the entirety of a computer program." OpenAI's ChatGPT agent is not, by any extension of the word, "already a powerful tool for handling complex tasks," but it has not, in any meaningful sense, committed to any actual outcomes. As a result, potential users — subject to a 24/7 marketing campaign — have been pushed toward a website that can theoretically do anything or nothing, and have otherwise been left to their own devices. The endless gaslighting, societal pressure, media pressure, and pressure from their bosses has pushed hundreds of millions of people to try a product that even its creators can't really describe. As I've said in the past, OpenAI is deliberately using Weekly Active Users so that it doesn't have to publish its monthly active users, which I believe would be higher. Why wouldn't it do this? Well, OpenAI has 20 million paying ChatGPT subscribers and five million "business customers," with no explanation of what the difference might be. This is already a mediocre (3.5%) conversion rate, yet its monthly active users (which are likely either 800 million or 900 million, but these are guesses!) would make that rate lower than 3%, which is pretty terrible considering everybody says this shit is the future. I also am tired of having people claim that "search" or "brainstorm" or "companions" are a lasting, meaningful business models. So, OpenAI announced that it has hit its first $1 billion month on August 20, 2025 on CNBC, which brings it exactly in line with my estimated $5.26 billion in revenue that I believe it has made as of the end of July. However, remember what the MIT study said: enterprise adoption is high but transformation is low. There are tons of companies throwing money at AI, but they are not seeing actual returns. OpenAI's growth as the single-most-prominent company in AI (and if we're honest, one of the most prominent in software writ large) makes sense, but at some point will slow, because the actual returns for the businesses aren't there. If there were, we'd have one article where we could point at a ChatGPT integration that at scale helped a company make or save a bunch of money, written in plain English and not a gobbledygook of "profit improvement." Also… OpenAI is projected to make $12.7 billion in 2025. How exactly will it do that? Is it really making $1.5 billion a month by the end of the year? Even if it does, is the idea that it keeps burning $10 billion or more every year into eternity? What actual revenue potential does OpenAI have long-term? Its products are about as good as everyone else's, cost about the same, and do the same things. ChatGPT is basically the same product as Claude or Grok or any number of different LLMs. The only real advantages that OpenAI has are infrastructure and brand recognition. These models have clearly hit a wall where training is hitting diminishing returns, meaning that its infrastructural advantage is that they can continue providing its service at scale, nothing more. It isn't making its business cheaper, other than the fact that it mostly hasn’t had to pay for it...other than the site in Abilene Texas where it’s promised Oracle $30 billion a year by 2028. I'm sorry, I don't buy it! I don't buy that this company will continue growing forever, and its stinky conversion rate isn't going to change anytime soon. How? Literally…how! How? How! HOW??? Nobody ever answers this question! “Efficiencies”? If you’re going to say GPT-5 — here’s a scoop I have about how it’s less efficient! It's very, very, very common for people to conflate "AI" with "generative AI." Make sure that whatever you're claiming or being told is actually about Large Language Models, as there are all sorts of other kinds of machine learning that people love to bring up. LLMs have nothing to do with Folding@Home, autonomous cars, or most disease research. A lot of people think that they're going to tell me "I use this all the time!" and that'll change my mind. I cannot express enough how irrelevant it is that you have a use case, as every use case I hear is one of the following: This would all be fine and dandy if people weren't talking about this stuff as if it was changing society. None of these use cases come close to explaining why I should be impressed by generative AI. It also doesn't matter if you yourself have kind of a useful thing that AI did for you once. We are so past the point when any of that matters. AI is being sold as a transformational technology, and I am yet to see it transform anything. I am yet to hear one use case that truly impresses me, or even one thing that feels possible now that wasn't possible before. This isn't even me being a cynic — I'm ready to be impressed! I just haven't been in three fucking years and it's getting boring. Also, tell me with a straight face any of this shit is worth the infrastructure. One of the most braindead takes about AI and coding is that "vibe coding" is "allowing anyone to build software." While technically true, in that one can just type "build me a website" into one of many AI coding environments, this does not mean it is functional or useful software. Let's make this really clear: AI cannot "just handle coding." Read this excellent piece by Colton Voege, then read this piece by Nik Suresh. If you contact me about AI and coding without reading these I will send them to you and nothing else, or crush you like a car in a garbage dump, one or the other. Also, show me a vibe coded company. Not a company where someone who can code has quickly spun up some features, a fully-functional, secure, and useful app made entirely by someone who cannot code. You won't be able to find this as it isn't possible. Vibe Coding is a marketing term based on lies, peddled by people who have either a lack of knowledge or morals. Are AI coding environments making people faster? I don't think so! In fact, a recent study suggested they actually make software engineers slower. The reason that nobody is vibe coding an entire company is because software development is not just "put a bunch of code in a pile and hit "go," and oftentimes when you add something it breaks something else. This is all well and good if you actually understand code — it's another thing entirely when you are using Cursor or Claude Code like a kid at an arcade machine turning the wheel repeatedly and pretending they're playing the demo. Vibe coders are also awful for the already negative margins of most AI coding environments, as every single thing they ask the model to do is imprecise, burning tokens in pursuit of a goal they themselves don't understand. "Vibe coding" does not work, it will not work, and pretending otherwise is at best ignorance and at worst supporting a campaign built on lies. If you are an AI booster, please come up with better arguments. And if you truly believe in this stuff, you should have a firmer grasp on why you do so. It's been three years, and the best some of you have is "it's real popular!" or "Uber burned a lot of money!" Your arguments are based on what you wish were true rather than what's actually true, and it's deeply embarrassing. Then again, there are many well-intentioned people who aren't necessarily AI boosters who repeat these arguments, regardless of how thinly-framed they are, in part because we live in a high-information, low-processing society where people tend to put great faith in people who are confident in what they say and sound smart. I also think the media is failing on a very basic level to realize that their fear of missing out or seeming stupid is being used against them. If you don't understand something, it's likely because the person you're reading or hearing it from doesn't either. If a company makes a promise and you don't understand how they'd deliver on it, it's their job to explain how, and your job to suggest it isn't plausible in clear and defined language. This has gone beyond simple "objectivity" into the realm of an outright failure of journalism. I have never seen more misinformation about the capabilities of a product in my entire career, and it's largely peddled by reporters who either don't know or have no interest in knowing what's actually possible, in part because all of their peers are saying the same nonsense. As things begin to collapse — and they sure look like they're collapsing, but I am not making any wild claims about "the bubble bursting" quite yet — it will look increasingly more deranged to bluntly publish everything that these companies say. Never have I seen an act of outright contempt more egregious than Sam Altman saying that GPT-5 was actually bad, and that GPT-6 will be even better. Members of the media: Sam Altman does not respect you. He is not your friend. He is not secretly confiding in you. He thinks you are stupid and easily-manipulated, and will print anything he says, largely in part because many members of the media will print exactly what he says whenever he says it. To be clear, if you wrote about it and actively mocked it, that's fine. But let's close by discussing the very nature of AI skepticism, and the so-called "void" between those who "hate" AI and those who "love" AI, from the perspective of one of the more prominent people in the "skeptic" side. Critics and skeptics are not given the benefit of grace, patience, or, in many cases, hospitality when it comes to their position. While they may receive interviews and opportunities to "give their side," it is always framed as the work of a firebrand, an outlier, somebody with dangerous ideas that they must eternally justify. They are demonized, their points under constant scrutiny, their allegiances and intentions constantly interrogated for some sort of moral or intellectual weakness. "Skeptic" and "critic" are words said with a sneer or trepidation — that the listener should be suspicious that this person isn't agreeing that AI is the most powerful, special thing ever. To not immediately fall in love with something that everybody is talking about is to be framed as a "hater," to have oneself introduced with the words "not everybody agrees..." on 40% of appearances. By comparison, AI boosters are the first to get TV appearances and offers to be on panels, their coverage featured prominently on Techmeme, selling slop-like books called shit like The Future Of Intelligence: Masters Of The Brain featuring 18 interviews with different CEOs that all say the same thing. They do not have to justify their love — they simply have to remember all the right terms, chirping out "test-time compute" and "the cost of inference is going down" enough times to summon Wario Amodei to give them an hour-long interview where he says "the models, they are, in years, going to be the most powerful school teacher ever built." And yeah, I did sell a book, because my shit fucking rocks. I have consistent, deeply-sourced arguments that I've built on over the course of years. I didn't "become a hater" because I'm a "contrarian," I became a hater because the shit that these fucking oafs have done to the computer pisses me off. I wrote The Man Who Killed Google Search because I wanted to know why Google Search sucked. I wrote Sam Altman, Freed because at the time I didn't understand why everybody was so fucking enamoured with this damp sociopath. Everything I do comes from genuine curiosity and an overwhelming frustration with the state of technology. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and 60 views, and have written it as an exploration of subjects that grows as I write. I do not have it in me to pretend to be anything other than what I am, and if that is strange to you, well, I'm a strange man, but at least I'm an honest one. I do have a chip on my shoulder, in that I really do not like it when people try to make other people feel stupid, especially when they do so as a means of making money for themselves or somebody else. I write this stuff out because I have an intellectual interest, I like writing, and by writing, I am able to learn about and process my complex feelings about technology. I happen to do so in a manner that hundreds of thousands of people enjoy every month, and if you think that I've grown this by "being a hater," you are doing yourself the disservice of underestimating me, which I will use to my advantage by writing deeper, more meaningful, more insightful things than you. I have watched these pigs ruin the computer again and again, and make billions doing so, all while the media celebrates the destruction of things like Google, Facebook, and the fucking environment in pursuit of eternal growth. I cannot manufacture my disgust, nor can I manufacture whatever it is inside me that makes it impossible to keep quiet about the things I see.

Title: AI’s $1 Trillion Shakeout: Bubble, Correction, Or Market Reset
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/08/26/ais-1-trillion-shakeout-bubble-correction-or-market-reset/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T00:32:46Z
Full Content:
ByMark Minevich, Contributor. In recent weeks, AI investors and enterprise leaders have felt the yo-yo effect of the AI market. Starting August 18, a four-day slide erased almost $1 trillion from the market caps of tech’s megacap companies. Nvidia, Palantir, and other so-called AI companies shed billions in value in a matter of days. Meta has announced a hiring freeze in its AI division. Even the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, casually remarked that “AI is a bubble.” The irony? Engineers in the sector continue to command $100 million pay packages. AI startups continue to raise funding at valuations that defy gravity. Additionally, companies from Microsoft to Google are integrating AI features across their products at a record speed. The real question isn’t whether AI is a bubble. The better question is: what kind of bubble—if any—are we in, and what comes after? For much of the past 18 months, AI stocks soared based on projections and expectations. Nvidia tripled in value. Palantir’s valuations are reminiscent of the dot-com era. In August, the S&P’s price-to-book ratio reached 5.3, which is higher than the 2000 bubble peak. When valuations stretch that far, even small doubts can trigger outsized sell-offs. The rotation out of AI has been partly seasonal. August is historically weak for equities, and funds have been taking profits in overcrowded trades. However, the speed and depth of AI’s decline reveal something deeper: investors are finally asking tough questions about the business impact. New data fueled that scrutiny. A report from MIT showed that 95% of generative AI pilots fail to deliver any measurable return on investment. McKinsey research similarly found that while 8 in 10 companies deploy generative AI tools, most see no bottom-line gains. AI may be everywhere in boardrooms and demos, but it remains conspicuously absent from earnings statements. This fact is what caused markets to dip. The MIT statistic shouldn’t surprise seasoned executives. Many companies are treating AI as a marketing checkbox rather than a strategic capability. Money is being funneled into headline-grabbing initiatives, such as customer-facing chatbots and generative content tools. At the same time, the real ROI lies hidden in back-office automation, supply chain optimization, and finance functions. The most significant determinant of success isn’t the model itself, but how it’s adopted and integrated. Companies that prioritize impressive demos without redesigning workflows inevitably fail. By contrast, enterprises that embed AI into core processes (expense reporting, claims processing, compliance checks) consistently see measurable productivity gains. Another issue is the obsession with building in-house. For many organizations, partnering with trusted vendors provides faster time-to-value and avoids the talent bottleneck. Trying to replicate what OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google has already done internally often results in wasted human hours and failed pilots. Then there’s the problem of “agent sprawl.” As different departments spin up their own AI pilots, enterprises risk a patchwork of ungoverned tools, inconsistent security, and rising costs. Without a governance model that scales, these initiatives collapse under their own weight. The reality is that adoption strategy, not AI hype, determines ROI. The mixed signals coming from industry leaders further complicate the picture. Sam Altman’s “AI is a bubble” remark spooked investors, although insiders suggest his comments were directed at the valuations of huge startups, not giants like OpenAI or Nvidia. Some even speculate it was a tactical move, cooling off competitors such as Meta, which had been luring OpenAI engineers with $100 million signing packages. Meta’s AI hiring freeze may appear ominous on the surface, but the company is actually spending more than ever on AI infrastructure. The shift isn’t about retreat, but about moving from a talent land-grab to execution. In fact, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are quietly doubling down on AI integration across products that generate real revenue. Plus, Nvidia, despite stock swings, reported data center revenue up nearly 70% year-over-year. This further drives home the point that the infrastructure layer of AI is delivering tangible profits. The signs of a bubble are undeniable with valuations stretched to dot-com levels, engineers signing contracts worth nine figures and a 95% project failure rate in enterprise pilots. But there are equally strong signs that this is merely a correction. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are not speculative bets; they’re profitable, cash-rich companies building foundational technologies. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are not Pets.com. A more useful analogy may be the early internet. In 1995, valuations were huge, startups were burning cash, and most experiments failed. But beneath the noise, the infrastructure for a digital economy was being laid. The productivity payoff lagged the hype, but when it arrived, it reshaped the global economy. AI is following a similar trajectory. In the near term, volatility is unavoidable. Valuations will continue to be tested. Venture funding will tighten, forcing weak AI startups into consolidation or collapse. Public companies that heavily rely on AI marketing without demonstrating effective adoption will remain under pressure. The headlines and hype around $100 million salaries and “AI everywhere” marketing will cool. Many projects will be quietly wound down as the easy money phase of AI comes to an end. AI is not a feature, it is a general-purpose technology on par with electricity and the internet. It is already transforming healthcare, energy, finance, defense, logistics, and education. The productivity paradox is fundamental, as significant investments must come first and measurable gains follow later. Just as the internet required massive infrastructure before creating trillions in value, AI requires time to mature and integrate. By 2030, analysts project AI will add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Most startups will vanish, but the survivors (likely fewer than 5%) will dominate entire industries. The next decade will see the rise of new global giants, and the reshaping of competition across every sector. We’re not witnessing the end of AI, we’re witnessing the end of its hype cycle. The startup bubble is deflating. The talent war is cooling. But the underlying trend of AI as a driver of productivity, transformation, and new business models is only beginning. This is not a dot-com bus, but a recalibration of expectations. Execution will matter more than narrative. The adoption strategy will matter more than the experiments. Enterprises that focus on back-office productivity, integration, and governance will capture real ROI. In the short term, expect volatility, pain, and consolidation. In the long term, expect AI to weave into every industry and redefine productivity, creativity, and competition. Yes, some air is coming out, but AI itself is no bubble. The future belongs to AI. The only question is which enterprises will survive the shakeout and lead the next industrial revolution.

Title: AI Revolution Will Crush the Blue States

“The first step onto the corporate ladder is vanishing for many new graduates,” argued a recent Fortune report. As a result, CEOs are warning that entry-level jobs are on the brink of extinction, with internships and opportunities for college graduates drying up. Of course, not everyone will feel the impact in the same way. At the top of the pyramid are investors, entrepreneurs, and elite programmers who now command salaries on par with professional athletes. But artificial intelligence — fuelled by a huge infusion of Wall Street cash — threatens to eliminate many software jobs, along with high-end professional roles that involve routine analysis. Young people are acutely aware of this. In the class I teach with Marshall Koplansky at Chapman University, several students predicted that the jobs they currently hold will soon disappear. Among them were a game designer, two human-resources executives, and a manufacturing and warehouse manager. My engineering colleagues report a similar trend. While opportunities remain strong for mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as for those designing robotics, the outlook is far less certain for computer science students. Despite soaring profits at the largest tech companies, AI programming tools have enabled sweeping layoffs at firms such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Today, among college graduates aged 22-27, computer science and computer engineering majors face some of the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In response, many firms are now focusing on building tangible products rather than merely shifting algorithms for commerce or generating more social media. In the aerospace and defence sectors, for example, AI is seen not as an end but a tool. It is a means to enhance human creativity and productivity rather than replace it. “Software is not in the greatest position with AI,” Delian Asparouhov, who runs a firm focused on in-space manufacturing, told me. “Now people are shifting to hard tech. Designing and building spaceships still needs people.” This could spell trouble for elite universities, but represents a major advantage for schools that teach the practical skills companies actually need. So far, these opportunities are largely concentrated in red and purple states in the Midwest and South — the regions most focused on reshoring manufacturing and other industries from overseas. Attitudes are shifting alongside these economic changes. One recent survey found that roughly 83% of Generation Z feel that learning a skilled trade can be a better pathway to economic security than college — including 90% of those already holding college degrees. Indeed, as college enrolment has dropped between 2020 and 2023, trade school enrolment grew by 10%. These changes suggest that as practical skills gain value, regions offering them are likely to attract both talent and jobs. Read the rest of this piece at: UnHerd.

Title: Betting on Brazil’s Most Disruptive Stock

By Adam Sharp PostedAugust 26, 2025 Here at the Daily Reckoning, we love contrarian investments. Back in February, we highlighted an idea that fits the bill nicely: buying Brazilian stocks. Specifically, we mentioned the iShares Brazil ETF (EWZ), which was yielding around 8% at the time, and Nubank (NU), a fast-growing digital bank. Brazil had been in a slump since its stock market peaked in 2008. The country’s stock market is heavily tilted towards banks and commodities (especially oil and iron ore). Its currency has been volatile and generally fallen in value versus the dollar. So most investors have steered clear of the country. But this is starting to turn around. The largest Brazilian ETF, EWZ, is up around 10% since February and looking good. It remains dirt cheap with fat yields. The plan is to hold this one for many years, and possibly decades, to come. Let the magic of compounding do its work. But today we’re going to focus on Nubank, which at the time was a small position in my portfolio. Since that time, I’ve learned a lot more about Nubank (and bought more). And the outlook for this company is bright. Let’s dig into this remarkable growth story. Nubank is a fully-digital bank based in Brazil. It boasts a remarkable 122 million customers, nearly all of which use its popular mobile app. It offers checking and savings accounts, credit cards, personal loans, investment accounts, and more. The company just reported Q2 2025 results, and they handily beat expectations. This company’s growth has been wildly consistent. Since 2020, they’ve grown from around 20 million active customers to more than 102 million: Source: Fiscal.ai When we first highlighted Nubank back on February 25, 2025, shares were trading around $11.20. Today NU is up 23% to $14.20. But I don’t plan to sell anytime soon. This growth story looks to still be in its early stages. Nubank is currently used by around 60% of Brazilian adults, a remarkable achievement. Management has been focused on further monetizing these customers with loans, investment services, crypto offerings, insurance, business lending, and more. Nubank has many ways to further monetize its growing Brazilian user base. But the company is also expanding into Mexico and Colombia, with significant progress so far. In Mexico, Nubank has 12 million customers representing 13% of the total population. In Colombia, the company has 3.4 million customers, or nearly 10% of that country’s total population. It seems likely that Nubank will continue expanding across Latin America. Its digital banking model is low cost, with no physical locations or real estate expenses. The model is beautiful and Nubank has the potential to gobble up market share from existing banks across Latam (and possibly beyond). Brazil has been in an economic slump for a while now. Innovative growth stories like Nubank are few and far between. So the market generally pays less for Brazilian stocks than they do for American equivalents. Today Nubank trades at a trailing P/E ratio of around 30. For a company growing revenue and earnings around 40%, that’s a very fair price. If Nubank were an American firm, I can’t even imagine how high its valuation would be. Suffice to say 4x higher might be on the low side. On the whole, I think Nubank is trading at an extremely fair price today and don’t plan to sell anytime soon. Of course, NU is still an emerging market investment. If Brazil were to go through a currency or banking crisis, Nubank would almost certainly take a big hit in the short-term (along with everything else). Still, it’s a risk I’m willing to take in order to access the potential upside. We’ll keep readers updated on Nubank and the larger Brazil investment theme.

ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. Through the CFPB’s anti-progress attempt to price control some of the financial products of the U.S.’s most successful financial institutions (see attempts to maintain Rule 1033), we’ve happened upon a truth about what makes big banks big: they invest staggering sums on infrastructure meant to improve the customer experience, and they similarly spend staggering sums to protect the accounts and information of those who bank with them. It’s a crucial reminder of what politicians are all-too-frequently unaware of: there are no shortcuts to success. Success doesn’t just happen, and it’s certainly not an effect of governmental decree. Instead, the big get that way by not just meeting the needs of existing and would-be customers, but well exceeding them. The truths about the corporate cultures that lend themselves to greatness are truths that Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) and James Hagerty (R-TN) would be wise to internalize. That’s because at present, the two senators are trying to make financial institutions big by decree. The speculation here is that they’ll fail. Evidence supporting the above claim can be found in the Senators’ proposal to alter Deposit Insurance Fund coverage. Specifically, they would increase deposit insurance per account to $20 million for institutions with assets under $250 billion, all the while maintaining the $250,000 per account deposit insurance cap for institutions with more than $250 billion in assets. What’s most galling about the proposed legislation isn’t the blatant regulatory favoritism, it’s that it aims to make smaller financial institutions bigger not through competitive advances, but just because. Yes, the Senators are regulating a shortcut to success that won’t just likely fail, but that is quite simply dangerous. Perhaps not asked enough by the Senators is why some banks are enormous by U.S. standards, some are medium size, and some are small. This doesn’t just happen, as much as it’s an effect of highly effective banking practices at the top of the U.S. size pyramid. If readers doubt any of the above, they need only travel back in time to the Spring of 2024 when J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon broached the possibility of moving his retirement time up. The instant reaction from the stock market was a 4.5% correction in JPM’s shares that shaved $25 billion off the institution’s market capitalization. Well, there’s your answer. J.P. Morgan and other banks at the top that compete with it aren’t big for random reasons, but because they can lay claim to some of the best financial talent in the world. Please contemplate this truth as Sens. Alsobrooks and Hagerty pursue regulatory favoritism that would allow smaller banks to offer customers deposit insurance at a level that JPM, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and many other large banks presently cannot. Assuming the favoritism works even a little, banks that were small for a variety of reasons would suddenly be faced with the challenging prospect of putting much more sizable amounts of money to work. This is no easy feat, and since it’s not, banks and the system more broadly would be imperiled by the favoritism. Let’s not do it. Instead, let’s encourage banks to compete on product and services, not regulatory handouts. Specifically, smaller banks have been hamstrung since 2008 by all manner of price controls on debit, credit and other services that have limited their ability to compete. In short, remove regulations rather than impose them. For all banks. And let the competition begin. As J.P. Morgan Chase’s growth under Dimon attests, there’s no reason that small and medium-sized can’t grow large. Just the same, there are no shortcuts to success.

Title: After Months of Calm, Nvidia Earnings Could Spark a Big Stock Market Move

All eyes are on Nvidia heading into the artificial intelligence chip giant's second-quarter earnings report, due after markets close later today. As the world's most valuable public company, Nvidia (NVDA) has more influence than any over the value of the S&P 500 and the more than $1 trillion indexed to it. With a market capitalization of about $4.4 trillion, Nvidia accounts for about 8% of the benchmark index, a whole percentage point more than its next largest component, Microsoft (MSFT). Nvidia's stock is expected to post its biggest post-earnings stock move in over a year, according to recent options pricing. That could translate into a market response that resembles that of a pivotal piece of economic data more than a single company's earnings report. Options data suggests traders expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.9% in either direction on Thursday, the first day of trading after Nvidia's report. The S&P 500 moved more than 0.9% on nearly a third of all trading days this year through Tuesday. But that figure is inflated by the tariff tumult that gripped markets in March and April, when the index jumped or fell by at least 1 percentage point on more than half of trading days. So far in the relatively calmer second half of the year, the index has moved more than 0.9% approximately one out of every 10 days. Nvidia's size isn't the only reason its earnings might move the whole market. It has also become an AI bellwether that can move the stocks of AI beneficiaries spanning a range of industries. The company's results, as a gauge of AI demand, exert significant influence over other semiconductor stocks. When Nvidia's results sent its shares plunging more than 8% in late February, the benchmark PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 6%, and not just because Nvidia accounts for about 9% of the index. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) tumbled more than 7% the same day, as did chip fabrication equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT). As the notion of what constitutes an "AI stock" has expanded, so has Nvidia's influence. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST), nuclear power providers that have struck major data center deals with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), plunged more than 7% and 12%, respectively, following Nvidia's results in February. Server makers Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) saw their shares fall nearly 7% and 16%, respectively, while software provider Palantir (PLTR) slid 5%. The ripple effects of Nvidia's earnings could be even more pronounced now because AI beneficiaries and the "Magnificent Seven," after big gains this year, make up more of the S&P 500 than they did in February. Palantir has added roughly three-quarters of its value in the past 6 months, while Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained more than 50%. Broadcom, one of just nine U.S. companies worth more than $1 trillion, has climbed by more than a third in the same period. Before Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech sent stocks soaring last Friday, tech and AI stocks were having a rough week. Palantir last Wednesday notched its longest losing streak in more than a year. An ETF tracking the "Magnificent Seven" stocks slid 3.5% over the first four days of the week. Investor concerns about an AI bubble, which have repeatedly bubbled up over the past few years, resurfaced last week. Wall Street was unnerved by an MIT survey that found nearly all companies have seen no material benefits from their AI investments. And Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, reportedly said the prior week that investors had become “overexcited” about AI. Those headlines amplified worries that tech valuations had become stretched after a strong rebound off April's "Liberation Day" lows. The S&P 500 IT sector index has risen about 50% since bottoming out on April 8, far outpacing the 30% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent options and stock prices.

Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaking giant at the center of the artificial intelligence revolution, has delivered huge returns for investors since its meteoric rise in 2023 and 2024. But the world's most valuable company, led by the so-called "Godfather of AI," CEO Jensen Huang, has investments of its own. The company is required to disclose its portoflio information every quarter using the SEC Form 13-F. This filing offers only a snapshot of Nvidia's portfolio at the end of the quarter. It does not provide any details about gains or losses made from any sales made during the quarter. Here's what Nvidia's AI best looked like at the end of June— By far Nvidia's most valuable holding is CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV), an AI cloud computing provider that went public in March. At the end of June, Nvidia held 24.3 million shares, that amounts to roughly 7% stake in the company, worth a little over $3.9 billion. As of Aug. 26, that stake is valued is close to $2.2 billion, after Coreweave saw almost a third of its share value disappear following disappointing quarterly earnings results. However, shares of CoreWeave have more than doubled from their IPO price of $40 in March to more than $90 in late August. Arm Holdings plc (ARM) is a U.K.-based developer of CPU chip designs whose clients include Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google. Nvidia reported a stake of 1.1 million Arm shares worth $178 million in June (about $154 million as of Aug. 26). Applied Digital Corp. (APLD) provides data center space to companies seeking AI compute infrastructure. Its shares have more than doubled this year, including a huge gain after the company agreed to lease data center operations to fellow Nvidia partner CoreWeave. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital. That position, which was worth about $77 million at the end of June, has grown to over $125 million as of Aug. 26. Nebius Group NV (NBIS) is an Amsterdam-based provider of AI infrastructure. Nvidia first disclosed its 1.2 million-share stake in the company in February, and its stock has jumped more than two-thirds since. That means Nvidia's investment has only grown, from nearly $65 million in June to about $85 million at the end of August. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX), a biotech firm focused on AI-powered drug discovery. It's also another Nvidia investment that has seen its stock fall this year, dropping 27%. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Recursion as of June 30. Chinese autonomous vehicle manufacturer WeRide Inc. (WRD) operates a fleet spanning 30 cities across nine countries. Its shares spiked after Nvidia revealed a 1.7-million share stake in February, but they've lost about a third of their value in 2025. Nvidia's portfolio has largely been successful this year, with stocks like CoreWeave actually outperforming the chipmaker itself so far in 2025. Nvidia stock has been no slouch, though, gaining 33% this year and hitting a record high of $182.70 earlier this month. The company is due to report quarterly results after the market closes Wednesday, and AI investors will be watching for clues from Huang about the state of the sector.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Let HR Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Between the need for skilled workers and employee demand for training, HR may want to prioritize L&D and agitate for a bigger budget next year. After several years of an employee-friendly economy, the pivot back to an employer’s market may feel like whiplash for many workers. Anxiety is up, and employees are fumbling for security in a time of widespread layoffs and shrinking opportunity. Benefits and salary budgets generally have stagnated, and employers have seemingly pared back learning and development as well. Respondents to HR Dive’s Identity of HR survey said training had dropped in importance at their organization, with only 5% saying it was a top priority this year, compared to 12% last year. As a result, recruiters have been looking for highly qualified candidates to fill certain roles, while some say overlooked talent can’t access the learning opportunities that might help them rise into those positions — creating a catch-22. AI skills have commanded much of the conversation around training, and reports have shown that few employers are investing in learning programs on the topic. A July report from BambooHR found roughly one-third of employers have offered such training, and a May report from Amazon Web Services showed many employers don’t even know what such training would look like. Between the need for skilled workers and employee demand for training, some HR professionals have shifted from a recruiting focus to one of retention and development; those eyeing a similar path may need to agitate for a bigger L&D budget next year. Concerned about the encroachment of AI on entry-level opportunities, Gen Z has shown it will particularly prioritize employers who can offer skill-building and continuous learning opportunities, with more than half of Gen Z workers telling Flexa as much.

August 26, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: $25 for that? Consumers are going elsewhere for lunch.

Good morning. Last night, US President Donald Trump said he was firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook "effective immediately." In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump said there was "sufficient reason" to believe Cook had made false statements on mortgage agreements. In response, Cook said Trump has no authority to fire her and she will not resign. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, fast casual chains like Chipotle and Cava are losing their freshness. What's on deck: Markets: Why Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad won't save American Eagle's stock. Tech: A mix of AI FOMO and fear is sweeping Hollywood. Business: Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. But first, the rise and fall of the fast-casual slop bowl. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Let's grab lunch — my treat. Anywhere you want, as long as it's not Chipotle, Cava, or Sweetgreen. You expect me to pay $25 for … that? They've been dubbed "slop bowls," those mounds of vegetables, grains, and a protein or two. They were all the rage in the 2010s. Now, they could be why some fast casual chains are losing out, BI's Emily Stewart writes. The complaints are piling up: warm, weird salads; ingredients combined in the wrong way; portions so small, customers are filming employees just to try and get more food. And for the privilege? A price tag that makes you want to hurl. "Value is front of mind for nearly every consumer right now, and I think these restaurants just don't have a sharp enough value proposition," says Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. So consumers appear to be going elsewhere, to places where, if they're spending that kind of money, they can sit down and get a better experience. Places that feel more affordable, more satisfying. Places like Chili's. Chili's has been on a hot streak. In its most recent earnings report, the CEO of Chili's parent company, Brinker, took a victory lap, declaring: "Chili's is officially back, baby back." The chain posted impressive sales growth, pushing Brinker's revenue past Wall Street's expectations to $1.46 billion. Alex Fasciano, a senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research, noted that Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden) and The Cheesecake Factory have also had a strong year. Part of that growth may come from value-conscious diners tired of paying more for less. "Why am I paying $25 for a burrito and chips and guac when I could pay maybe a little bit more and have full service?" Fasciano says. With more of us heading back into the office, many are only just realising how expensive these slop bowls have gotten. What started as a slightly more expensive, healthier alternative to fast food now feels overpriced and underwhelming. As America's slop bowl moment fades, the next big thing might just be a full plate and a fair price. 1. Trump has bought $100 million in bonds since starting his second term. That's according to a new filing from the Office of Government Ethics. The president's bond purchases could stand to benefit if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, which Trump has been pressuring the central bank to do for months. 2. Behind Palantir's bad month. The tech titan's stock was flying high in 2025, reaching a record high in mid-August before shares fell 17%. Investors are feeling hesitant about Palantir's stock for three reasons, but optimism remains strong around its long-term trajectory. 3. Sydney Sweeney can't keep American Eagle's stock afloat. Bank of America analysts cut their rating on the stock to "underperform," citing the negative impact of tariffs. Any positive impact from Sweeney's jeans ad, including its rise to meme stock fame last month, will get canceled out, the firm said. 1. How Hollywood is using AI on the hush. Entertainment giants like Netflix and Lionsgate have recently touted their embrace of AI, but the tech still has a stigma among the creative community. Five Hollywood insiders told BI they dread being associated with AI, and those who are using it are doing so in secret. 2. Meta continues to poach AI talent for its superintelligence team. Meta has recruited at least 10 previously unreported researchers from Google's DeepMind since July, according to LinkedIn data reviewed by BI. The tech giant has also targeted Scale AI, with six of its AI researchers announcing their departures to join Meta in recent weeks. 3. OpenAI ramps up its healthcare push with a new hire. The company has tapped Doximity cofounder Nate Gross to lead its growing healthcare business. OpenAI aims to sell directly to healthcare customers rather than power other companies' products, reflecting a larger pivot: it wants to own not just foundation models, but AI infrastructure and applications, too. 1. Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. The popular dolls are on track to do $1 billion in sales this year, according to EMARKETER. And although they are no Beanie Babies, it's hard to imagine that Labubus will still be popular years from now, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 2. Burning Man kicks up business deals, too. Tech moguls, celebrities, and models flock to the Black Rock Desert every year for the Burning Man festival. But they do more than just party: Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg, are among the leaders who have made key business decisions amid the dusty festivities. 3. Why this app's CEO will cancel a user's $25K subscription. Dorsia lets its users snag reservations at top restaurants for either $175, $5,175, or $25,175 a year. CEO Marc Lotenberg says he's kicked several users off the platform since its launch in 2022, and told BI "being rude to servers" is a bannable offense. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI models to securely access external data and tools. Let us delve into understanding how to secure Spring AI MCP Servers with OAuth2. Spring AI is an extension of the popular Spring Boot framework that allows developers to integrate large language models (LLMs) and AI capabilities directly into their applications. It simplifies building intelligent features such as chatbots, recommendation engines, and natural language understanding within Spring-based systems. OAuth2 is an open-standard authorization framework that allows applications to securely access resources on behalf of a user. In the context of Spring AI MCP servers, OAuth2 ensures that only authorized clients can interact with AI services, protecting sensitive data and AI endpoints. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications connect LLMs to data and tools, like how USB-C connects devices to peripherals. It enables building agents and complex workflows by linking models with the world. Learn more about MCP here. Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Spring applications. In the context of MCP servers, it ensures that only authorized clients can access AI model endpoints, protecting sensitive data and services. Key features of Spring Security for MCP servers: Using Spring Security, developers can: Overall, Spring Security provides the backbone for safely exposing AI model endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized clients can interact with the MCP server. Add these dependencies to your pom.xml: Define a controller that provides realistic stock data in MCP format. In production, you could fetch real stock data from APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. This Spring Boot controller, annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping("/stocks"), provides a simple API to fetch stock information. It stores stock symbols and their prices in an immutable Map called stockPrices. The @GetMapping("/{symbol}") method takes a stock symbol as a path variable, looks up the price, and if not found, throws a ResponseStatusException with a 404 status. If the stock exists, it creates a Map containing the symbol, price, currency (“USD”), company name (determined by the private getCompanyName method using a switch expression), and the current timestamp. The resulting map is returned as JSON when the API endpoint is called. Enable OAuth2 security for your MCP server: This Spring configuration class, annotated with @Configuration, sets up security for the application using Spring Security. It defines a SecurityFilterChain bean that customizes HTTP security. CSRF protection is disabled with csrf().disable() and CORS support is enabled using cors(). The configuration requires that any request to endpoints under /stocks/** must be authenticated. Finally, it configures the application as an OAuth2 resource server using JWT tokens (oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()), ensuring that only requests with valid JWTs can access the secured stock endpoints. To enable your MCP server to authenticate and authorize clients using OAuth2, you need to configure a client in application.properties. This configuration registers a client with the authorization server, specifying the client ID, secret, authentication method, and allowed grant types. With this configuration, your MCP server can request JWT tokens from the authorization server and include them in requests to secured endpoints. This setup ensures that only authorized clients can access your stock data API. For this tutorial, we will use Keycloak as the authorization server to register the client. The focus is on the MCP server, so Keycloak setup is not covered here. Note: Before configuring the OAuth2 client, you need to register your MCP server as a client in Keycloak. Create a new client, set the client ID (e.g., stocks-client), configure the client secret, and enable the client_credentials grant type. This allows your MCP server to obtain access tokens to secure its endpoints. After adding the dependencies, creating the controller, and configuring security, you can run your MCP server as a standard Spring Boot application. Use your IDE or execute mvn spring-boot:run from the command line in the project directory. Once the application starts, it will listen on the default port 8080. Obtain an access token using the client_credentials grant: Use the token to query stock information. Please note localhost:8080 will act as the mcp.example.com. The server will return a JSON response like: Unauthorized requests will be rejected with a 401 error. This setup ensures that only authenticated clients can access stock data, making the MCP server production-ready and secure. We created a Stocks Info MCP Server with Spring AI and secured it using OAuth2. The server returns stock data only to authorized clients, ensuring secure access while keeping the setup simple and easy to use. We will contact you soon. Δ Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels. Second quarter Revenue estimate: $46.23 billion Third quarter Full year 2026 Source: Bloomberg Correction, Wednesday, August 27 — An earlier version of this post incorrectly presented previous remarks from Nvidia's Q1 analyst call as being said on the Q2 call — those quotes have been removed.

Title: RKLB Stock To $85?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) has shown exceptional growth in 2025, with its stock climbing nearly 90% year-to-date. This surge has been driven by the company’s recent successful rocket launches and its ability to secure major new contracts, particularly related to its upcoming Neutron rocket program. But what could drive another sharp rally from current levels to targets above $85? The following analysis explores the main factors that could fuel such significant upside over the next three years. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – UNH Stock To $600? Rocket Lab’s revenue outlook points to substantial expansion. With last-twelve-month revenues of $504 million, the company could more than double its revenue base to around $1.2 billion by 2027. This growth is supported by several drivers: Rocket Lab’s valuation multiple highlights its trajectory. Trading at nearly 50 times trailing revenues, RKLB reflects the premium placed on high-growth space companies. Yet, multiple compression suggests strong upside: If revenues double in three years while the stock price holds steady, the revenue multiple would fall to 25x. Given the company’s growth and positioning, a more realistic scenario is a multiple near 35x by 2027. At that multiple applied to expected 2027 revenues above $1.2 billion, the implied share price is about $85—nearly 80% higher than today. This reflects Rocket Lab’s growth story and the valuation premium typically afforded to leading space firms. Several catalysts could accelerate Rocket Lab’s trajectory: Potential challenges could slow this trajectory: This analysis outlines an upside case for Rocket Lab based on its growth and positioning. While a move to $85+ offers attractive potential, investors must weigh these gains against real risks. The 2022 correction, when RKLB lost 83% of its value, underscored the volatility inherent in space investments. This bullish case depends on successful execution in Neutron development, contract wins, and global expansion. Investors should size positions carefully, recognizing both the large upside and the risks tied to this high-growth sector. As always, investing in just one or a few stocks carries risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a diversified collection of 30 stocks that has consistently beaten the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? Because HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with less risk, offering smoother performance, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. This reinforces the value of diversification, particularly when considering high-growth but volatile names like RKLB.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

(NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

ByWes Moss, Contributor. Is one of the most popular investing strategies quietly distorting the stock market? As index funds attract trillions, several outlets—including Barron’s and Harper’s Magazine—have voiced concern that a passive investing bubble could be forming. The core argument is that too much money is chasing too few stocks. Passive investing—through index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—has become so dominant that it funnels an enormous volume of investor capital into a shrinking pool of mega-cap names such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, for example, which often sit at the top of major index fund holdings. Because these funds are market-cap weighted, larger stocks attract proportionally more capital. That can create a feedback loop, where rising stock prices trigger more buying, which in turn pushes prices higher. Critics, such as Michael Green of Simplify Asset Management, warn that this dynamic may warp prices and inflate a bubble that could burst if flows reverse. They also worry that because index funds are essentially buy-and-hold vehicles, they don’t actively contribute to price discovery—the process that determines what a stock is truly worth based on supply and demand. Yet others push back. Steve Johnson at Financial Times, for instance, notes new research suggesting the “…surge in passive money has made equity markets more efficient, contradicting some previous research that has found the opposite.” Zooming out provides more perspective. According to Boston Consulting Group, global assets under management (AUM) hit $128 trillion by the end of 2024. Passive strategies grew to 20% of total global AUM by the end of 2024. There’s no doubt these figures are substantial, but they are far from overwhelming. While recent estimates indicate that systematic and passive strategies combined make up more than 60% of daily U.S. equity trading volume, pure passive index-tracking flows appear to represent a much smaller portion. In Q1 2023, ETFs—including both passive and active funds—comprised 32% of U.S. equity trading volume, according to the ICI 2024 Fact Book (p. 61). Even at the end of 2023, passive index-tracking mutual funds and ETFs accounted for just 18% of total U.S. stock market ownership—a figure that may rise to 30–35% when including other passive strategies—keeping in mind that while ownership data helps gauge influence, it doesn’t directly reflect how often positions are traded. This highlights a key point: truly passive flows are only a subset of ETF activity and likely make up a modest portion of total market turnover. Passive investing began gaining traction in 1976, when Vanguard founder Jack Bogle launched the first retail index mutual fund. Since then, index-based strategies have become a cornerstone of modern portfolio construction. By offering typically lower costs, broad market exposure, and built-in diversification, passive investing has attracted significant inflows from investors seeking long-term, market-matching performance. And despite concerns to the contrary, price discovery still occurs. Even when passive holds a sizable chunk of assets, active traders can still dictate equity and bond values. Hedge funds, portfolio managers, and individual investors continue to trade billions of dollars daily based on earnings reports, valuations, and other market signals. This activity helps play a critical role in maintaining market efficiency. Morningstar's March 2024 U.S. Active/Passive Barometer analyzed over 9,000 unique U.S. funds representing $23 trillion in assets—about 68% of the U.S. fund market. Yes, passive funds have attracted more inflows for nine straight years, but active funds still account for more than half of total U.S. assets. So, while passive investing is significant—and growing—it doesn’t appear to be the all-consuming force some critics make it out to be. Regardless of the rise in passive allocation, active investing is anticipated to continue playing a vital role for many reasons. Individuals pursue hands-on strategies in an attempt to beat the market, to invest in their values, to take activist positions, or even because they think they can outsmart their peers. In short, investors generally do continue to care about their money, suggesting active management is likely to remain relevant. The real surprise? Active managers outperformed passive funds far more often than headlines might suggest. Referring back to Morningstar’s March 2024 Active/Passive Barometer: As long as active funds are beating their benchmarks, market dynamics reasonably imply continued participation from investors, portfolio managers, and institutions actively trading, researching, and trying to outperform. For those concerned that algorithmic or computer-driven trading may fuel a passive bubble, it’s worth noting that these technologies have been embedded in market operations for decades. Rather than introducing a new risk, they’ve long been a foundational part of how modern markets function. While vigilance is warranted, the evidence suggests that market concentration risks are manageable. Passive investing does come with its own set of risks, as does any strategy. But data and market history indicate abundant competition from active investors, which doesn’t support the idea that current trends are inflating a bubble. There is clearly still sustained interest in active investing, which suggests a low probability of the market losing its ability to function properly. The fact that 42% of active funds beat their passive peers in all categories in 2024, and even more so in real estate and bonds, underscores how active management remains a key force in price discovery, even as passive strategies grow. Investors are expected to continue utilizing passive strategies as one piece of a thoughtfully constructed portfolio that often includes active avenues as well. Passive investing isn’t perfect, but the data fail to support the argument that it poses an imminent systemic risk. By focusing on controllable factors such as diversification and costs, investors may better position themselves to grow wealth steadily over time as part of a disciplined, long-term retirement strategy.

Title: OpenAI taps Instagram and Doximity execs to lead its next AI healthcare push
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-taps-doximity-cofounder-to-lead-its-next-healthcare-push-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-26T09:00:01Z

OpenAI is ramping up its push into healthcare with two high-profile new hires. The AI powerhouse has tapped Nate Gross, the cofounder and former chief strategy officer of Doximity, and Ashley Alexander, former co-head of product at Instagram, to lead the next phase of its healthcare business. Gross joined OpenAI in June, while Alexander assumed her role on Tuesday, according to their LinkedIn profiles. An OpenAI spokesperson said Gross will lead OpenAI's healthcare strategy, with early goals including co-creating new healthcare technologies with clinicians and researchers. Alexander will be a vice president of product in OpenAI's health business, building tech for individual consumers and clinicians, the spokesperson said. Until now, OpenAI has mostly powered other companies' products and partnered on medical AI research, rather than competing directly with its own healthcare tech. But the company has been telegraphing its expanding healthcare ambitions for months. CEO Sam Altman spotlighted ChatGPT's healthcare skills during the August launch of GPT-5, calling the model "a legitimate Ph.D. expert." "It can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey," Altman said, adding that GPT-5 performed "exceptionally well" on health-related questions. That performance was validated by HealthBench, OpenAI's first stand-alone healthcare tool, released in May. The open-source benchmark lets health systems, startups, and tech firms evaluate the accuracy and safety of health AI applications. OpenAI's healthcare ambitions reflect a larger pivot: OpenAI wants to own not just foundation models but also the infrastructure and AI applications built on top of them. In education, it launched Study Mode, a ChatGPT spinoff for students, in July to compete with Google's Gemini for Education. It demoed an AI sales agent in February, and rolled out an agentic tool that books reservations and shops for users in July. Healthcare AI is already crowded with tech giants. Palantir began developing AI for hospitals in 2021. Microsoft launched cloud-based clinician tools in 2020 and has since deepened ties with medical-records giant Epic to use AI in notetaking. Gross and Alexander's new roles at OpenAI aim to help the AI juggernaut pick up the pace. The OpenAI spokesperson said the company thinks "improving human health will be one of the defining impacts of AGI." Gross has deep roots in digital health. He cofounded Doximity 15 years ago as a "LinkedIn for doctors." In 2023, Doximity launched Doximity GPT, built on OpenAI tech, to help physicians with administrative tasks. So far this year, Doximity has acquired AI clinical evidence company Pathway Medical for $63 million and launched its own free AI scribe to compete with the likes of Microsoft and $5.3 billion startup Abridge. Doximity is one of the few healthcare companies that went public in 2021's IPO frenzy that isn't currently in the red. Despite significant share price fluctuations in the past four years, Doximity's stock is up over 60% above its opening price at IPO. Gross is also the cofounder of digital health investment and research firm Rock Health. Alexander worked at Meta for 12 years, 11 of which she spent on Instagram's product team, building out many of the app's features for advertising, creator monetization, and video content. OpenAI's health AI research to date has been spearheaded by Karan Singal, a former Google researcher who helped lead the development of the tech giant's medical LLM Med-PaLM. Singal will continue to run OpenAI's healthcare AI research, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI is hiring for at least two other roles in its health business. Its careers page lists openings for a health AI research scientist and a healthcare software engineer. Despite its plans to compete more directly with health startups, OpenAI isn't ditching its partnerships. The company most recently announced a collaboration with Kenyan primary care provider Penda Health in July to assess Penda Health's AI clinical copilot built on OpenAI's GPT-4o. It also continues to power the technology behind companies like pediatric care startup Summer Health and health insurtech Oscar Health. Jump to

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Anne Laurie| August 25, 20256:53 pm| 11 Comments This post is in: Excellent Links, Grifters Gonna Grift, Science & Technology, Trump Crime Cartel Palantir has been getting a huge number of deals like this, in what is extremely obviously self-dealing. [image or embed] — Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@reichlinmelnick.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 2:47 PM === I mean, when you wear the VP on your arm like the skin-puppet he is, why wouldn't you capitalize on that? — David (@dkboyd.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 3:27 PM I’ve been curious, and I thought y’all might be too. From Wired, “What Does Palantir Actually Do?”: Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance. But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it’s a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist… The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It’s really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it’s hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?” Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is… Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.” Xia calls Foundry, one of Palantir’s flagship software platforms, “a collection of different applications” that customers use to “operationalize data.” A fourth ex-employee dubbed Foundry a “super-charged filing cabinet.” While all of these descriptions are technically accurate, they could also apply to products from hundreds of other tech companies. So what sets Palantir apart? Part of the answer may lie in Palantir’s marketing strategy. Pinto says he believes that the company, which recently began using the tagline “software that dominates,” has cultivated its mysterious public image on purpose. Unlike consumer-facing startups that need to clearly explain their products to everyday users, Palantir’s main audience is sprawling government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. What it’s ultimately selling them is not just software, but the idea of a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems. To do that, Palantir often uses the language and aesthetics of warfare, painting itself as a powerful, quasi-military intelligence partner. “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world,” Palantir CEO Alexander Karp says in a February 2025 earnings call, “And when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”… Underneath the jargon and marketing, Palantir sells tools that its customers—corporations, nonprofits, government agencies—use to sort through data. What makes Palantir different from other tech companies is the scale and scope of its products. Its pitch to potential customers is that they can buy one system and use it to replace perhaps a dozen other dashboards and programs, according to a 2022 analysis of Palantir’s offerings published by blogger and data engineer Ben Rogojan. Crucially, Palantir doesn’t reorganize a company’s bins and pipes, so to speak, meaning it doesn’t change how data is collected or how it moves through the guts of an organization. Instead, its software sits on top of a customer’s messy systems and allows them to integrate and analyze data without needing to fix the underlying architecture. In some ways, it’s a technical band-aid. In theory, this makes Palantir particularly well suited for government agencies that may use state-of-the-art software cobbled together with programming languages dating back to the 1960s. Palantir began gaining steam in the 2010s, a decade when corporate business discourse was dominated by the rise of “Big Data.” Hundreds of tech startups popped up promising to disrupt the market by leveraging information that was now readily available thanks to smartphones and internet-connected sensors, including everything from global shipping patterns to the social media habits of college students. The hype around Big Data put pressure on companies, especially legacy brands without sophisticated technical know-how, to upgrade their software, or else risk looking like dinosaurs to their customers and investors… Palantir’s software is designed with nontechnical users in mind. Rather than relying on specialized technical teams to parse and analyze data, Palantir allows people across an organization to get insights, sometimes without writing a single line of code. All they need to do is log into one of Palantir’s two primary platforms: Foundry, for commercial users, or Gotham, for law enforcement and government users. Foundry focuses on helping businesses use data to do things like manage inventory, monitor factory lines, and track orders. Gotham, meanwhile, is an investigative tool specifically for police and government clients, designed to connect people, places, and events of interest to law enforcement. There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, a suite of AI-powered tools that can be integrated into Gotham or Foundry. Foundry and Gotham are similar: Both ingest data and give people a neat platform to work with it. The main difference between them is what data they’re ingesting. Gotham takes any data that government or law enforcement customers may have, including things like crime reports, booking logs, or information they collected by subpoenaing a social media company. Gotham then extracts every person, place, and detail that might be relevant. Customers need to already have the data they want to work with—Palantir itself does not provide any. A former Palantir staffer who has used Gotham says that, in just minutes, a law enforcement official or government analyst can map out who may be in a person’s network and see documents that link them together. They can also centralize everything an agency knows about a person in one place, including their eye color from their driver’s license, or their license plate from a traffic ticket—making it easy to build a detailed intelligence report. They can also use Gotham to search for a person based on a characteristic, like their immigration status, what state they live in, or whether they have tattoos… In some ways, Palantir can be seen as an amplifier of people’s intentions and biases. It helps them make evermore precise and intentional decisions, for better or for worse. But this may not always be obvious to Palantir’s users. They may only experience a sophisticated platform, sold to them using the vocabulary of warfare and hegemony. It may feel as if objective conclusions are flowing naturally from the data. When Gotham users connect disparate pieces of information about a person, it could seem like they are reading their whole life story, rather than just a slice of it. “It’s a really powerful tool,” says one former Palantir employee. “And when it’s in the wrong hands, it can be really dangerous. And I think people should be really scared about it.” ****** I quite enjoyed the Economist's article on Palantir: "Palantir might be the most overvalued firm of all time What would make it worth buying?" So sad to see the bubble bursting at bit. So very sad. www.economist.com/finance-and-… [image or embed] — notsewmot.bsky.social (@notsewmot.bsky.social) August 20, 2025 at 6:34 PM The Economist asks, “What Would Make It Worth Buying?” … No one can accuse Palantir, a data-analysis outfit and the most searingly hot stock of 2025, of unspectacular growth. It reported revenue of $1bn for the second quarter of this year, 48% higher than for the second quarter of 2024 and quadruple the figure for the same period in 2020. Silicon Valley types seek out companies satisfying the “rule of 40”, meaning that the sum of their operating margin and year-on-year sales growth, both expressed in percentage points, is higher than 40. Palantir’s score on that measure is 94: higher than any other enterprise-software firm with equivalent or greater sales. Among the world’s 25 biggest companies by market value—of which Palantir is one—only Nvidia, with its near-monopoly on artificial-intelligence chips, scores higher. Any investor would want a piece of that. The trouble is that Palantir’s market value has already soared to $430bn (see chart 1), more than 600 times its past year’s earnings and nearly triple the equivalent multiple for Cisco (or, indeed, Nvidia) at its peak. Software firms often prefer to express their valuation in terms of underlying sales, which puts Palantir’s multiple at around 120. For comparison, in 2005, the year before the Oxford English Dictionary added the verb “Google”, Google’s price-to-sales ratio peaked at 22. You need not look far to explain why Adam Parker of Trivariate Research, an investment firm, has published a note entitled “Could Palantir be the best short idea?” Writing in late May, he examined the ratio of enterprise value (which adjusts market value to account for debt and cash on the balance-sheet) to forecast sales for the coming year. On this measure Palantir then scored 73 and now scores 104. Mr Parker looked for other listed companies that had hit a multiple of 70 since 2000. Excluding financial firms and those with annual revenue of less than $50m, he found 14, the largest of which has a market value around a quarter of Palantir’s. That was Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a firm that sells some software but pitches itself to investors as a “bitcoin treasury company”, with a value derived from its cryptocurrency holdings rather than its sales… What, then, would it take to make Palantir’s shares worth buying? The firm helps everyone from spooks to fast-food chains analyse their data better and thereby improve their operations. Its blistering recent growth comes, in large part, from enthusiasm over adopting AI for such purposes. Palantir’s competitive advantage derives not just from its software and clever engineers, but from a high-level security clearance allowing it to process classified information from America’s defence and intelligence agencies. This gives it a “moat” with which to fend off competitors… Sustained revenue growth of that magnitude or more is possible, even at Palantir’s scale: Google (now called Alphabet), Meta and Nvidia have all managed it. Yet none was priced to do so in advance—and they are, after all, among the most successful firms in history. On a call with analysts and investors after announcing Palantir’s most recent results, Alex Karp, the chief executive (pictured), admitted that “this is a once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter.” The remarkable thing is that shareholders need the company’s revenue to continue to grow at a similar rate just to have a good chance of breaking even. There is no allowance for an upstart competitor, a scandal that makes clients wary or even a mere slowdown. If any of those strike, Cisco will need to make way for a new cautionary tale. Once we turf out the current batch of malefactors, could an honest administration pull Palantir’s vaunted security clearance, possibly while Peter Thiel stands before a Truth & Reconciliation Commission? ****** Fairness requirement: Strenuous argument against Palantir’s whole existence: Palantir: the world’s most evil company open.substack.com/pub/politica… [image or embed] — Ck (@ck-100.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 6:40 PM Filter No commenters available.

Old School August 25, 2025 at 7:05 pm I’m unclear as to whether Palantir is actually capable of producing the Navy and Air Force projects. Or is completion not really a deciding factor here? bbleh August 25, 2025 at 7:08 pm @Old School: this being the Trump era (see also Musk, Elon), I’m guessing that actually DOING things as opposed simply to talking about them and scooping up money from the gullible is … not a priority.

Dorothy A. Winsor August 25, 2025 at 7:35 pm I saw the headline and thought “the palantir is a communication device.” But no. Wrong universe. Martin August 25, 2025 at 7:54 pm @Old School: Hard to tell without more details. But Palantir basically specializes in recognizing a companies technical debt, and rather than helping a company solve it, just layer a new system on top that uses AI, etc. to try and replicate what your system ought to be doing, but in a different way. For instance in my career I was fairly notorious for building tools that could solve problems that the maintainers of the data couldn’t do. Their systems were collect information on students, or research expenditures, or payroll, etc but the tools weren’t designed to give broad insights on what was happening in those areas. They were useful for tracking A student, or A grant, or AN employee, but not seeing larger patterns. One way to solve that problem is to rework your tools so they are capable of doing that, but these tools are generally designed to enforce processes, and as such they are the laws of your organization in code, and reworking them can be very expensive, because any departures from how they worked before are effectively rewriting the laws of your organization. When I wasn’t part of the group responsible for the tool, but was tasked with providing the insight, rewriting the tools wasn’t an option – I didn’t own that system. Instead, I’d scrape that system in one way or another – pull from their dataset if I could get that permission, but as a last resort simply build a tool that emulated an employee accessing their tool and just scrape records from their UI. And from their data build a new tool that was designed to give the insight we needed – focusing on groups of students, demographics, categories of research or faculty, etc. You don’t need to rewrite the tool this way. It’s a way for an organization to neglect their technical debt a while longer but also can help an organization see the need to abstract their policy enforcement through code from their data from their code analysis. This is kind of what the microservices design pattern seeks to do as well. It’s not a bad approach, though if you are using it to neglect your technical debt it’s bad. Palantir does two things, from what I understand: Marc August 25, 2025 at 8:32 pm A year or so after 9/11 I was working on code with the PhD students for an “NSF” grant (we used to go to the sponsor’s meetings at the Ft Meade Travelodge) to look at communications flow between teams of workers on massive construction projects (nuclear plants, transit systems, etc.). This involved collecting massive amounts of metadata (no content) associated with email, CAD file updates, project change orders, and milestone completions. With some statistical analysis that could converted into an abstract model of the actual (as opposed to formal) organizational structure that would drive a simulation. Then we’d run the simulation thousands of times using genetic and ML algorithms to determine the “optimal” organizational structures for cost/schedule on future similar projects. Or, you could also figure out whom to remove to ensure that a project would never reach completion. That, among other things, is what Palantir does. JaneE August 26, 2025 at 12:33 am I don’t understand how Palantir could “overhaul antiquated human resources systems” if all it does is extract the old data from the existing antiquated system and give the users tools to generate analyses and give them better access to the old data. It would be a band-aid for the old system to let the users have better data until the system were overhauled. At that point the users would have the choice of whatever the newer system offered or let Palantir hoover up the new data to generate their analyses and reports. How does Palantir add new information if they don’t actually change the old system? I worked on those antiquated systems when they were new. Unless they actually have been updated to the newer languages and database structures getting information out is limited by what can be put in in the first place. If they already have all the data they need and just want to get additional views of the information without the time of programming it this might be a good solution, but that doesn’t sound like what the scrapped project was doing. Even if the Palantir solution is a good fit for what they want(ed) to do, this scrapping 12 years (and who knows how many man-years) of work because they want a specific (well connected politically) company to be given a chance to bid sounds like a totally corrupt deal. They didn’t bid 12 years ago – for whatever reason – so scrapping the current contractor really is nothing but political. Do the procurement regulations allow that type of patronage contracting? Aaron August 27, 2025 at 1:12 am @JaneE: Sounds like a good time to be wrapping up a boatload of acquisition deregulation, doesn’t it? Your email address will not be published.

Title: 350,000 Black Women Were Ousted From The Workforce—For Millennials, Where Are They Going Next?

ByJasmine Browley, Contributor. As I’ve stated time and time again, millennials know how to hustle. From the time we reached our formative years, our identities were melded into our professions. So imagine what happens when our merit is systemically attacked at a government level. When the most recent jobs report revealed that 350,000 Black women had left the labor force, I resisted the instinct to call those exits voluntary. “I personally term that as being ousted,” I told the experts I interviewed, “because a lot of those exits were not optional.” Behind that staggering number are women who are losing not only paychecks but also the stability, health access, and professional pathways that keep families and communities afloat. What happens next for them? Some are rebuilding through entrepreneurship, others are demanding systemic reforms, and all are navigating the intersection of workforce inequity and personal resilience. “Job loss directly translates into reduced income and potentially a loss of health insurance,” explained Fade Adetosoye, who helped lead a recent McKinsey study on Black maternal health and workforce participation. “That makes it harder for women to afford prenatal and postpartum care, medications, and services for conditions like gestational diabetes or hypertension—things that disproportionately impact Black women.” The ripple effects are profound. McKinsey’s research estimates that addressing the Black maternal health gap could add $25 billion to the U.S. economy annually and save $385 billion in healthcare costs. Without intervention, Black mothers lose an average of 14–15 healthy days per year for the rest of their lives due to childbirth-related conditions. “We’re talking 350,000 healthy years lost that women could be spending participating in the economy, investing in their families and communities,” Adetosoye told me. Her conclusion is stark: “The gold standard for birthing people should not be survival. It should be thriving. And there is absolutely a tie between Black maternal health disparities and economic mobility.” For Michelda Castro, the ousting wasn’t theoretical. She had climbed through finance and government program management roles, even overseeing a $69 million loan fund for underserved communities. But repeated experiences with bias, systemic barriers, and finally, layoffs tied to shifting federal priorities, left her searching for something more sustainable. “I was stressed, having panic attacks at work, working 60, 70 hours a week,” she recounted to me. “They told me I was doing a great job, but when the director role opened up—the one I’d been running for nine months—they didn’t even give me an interview. Then they asked me to train the white man they hired instead.” After another corporate stint ended in layoffs due to federal grant cuts handed down by the Trump administration, Castro leaned fully into entrepreneurship. More than a decade ago, she founded Versatile Image, a nonprofit that hosts the Unity Block Party in Utah, an annual cultural and economic festival that now generates over $100,000 in revenue. With the layoff, she focused renewed energy and focus into making the once side hustle into her full-time career. Still, she says the uphill climb is relentless: federal grants have been slashed and are continuing to be so, corporate sponsors have pulled out due to DEI alignment concerns, and banks remain reluctant to extend capital. “If I were a white man, the struggle would be glamorized—like starting Amazon in a garage,” she said. “But when it’s a Black woman, people call it complaining.” The broader context, says Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families and co-leader of the 75 Million Campaign, is that today’s job losses are less about performance and more about politics. “When you lose a job not because of your work but because of a political agenda, it can feel demoralizing,” Frye told me. “And for Black women, particularly Black mothers—more than 80% of whom are the primary breadwinners—it threatens the stability of entire families.” She points to the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as both a cause and a consequence. “This administration has deployed a different narrative, but the purpose is the same as always: to erode the pathways that allowed Black women even a chance at the middle class,” Frye told me. Her call to action: don’t internalize the systemic failures. “This is not about individual deficiencies. It’s an ideological agenda. And we must push back—not only to protect jobs, but to protect the progress that got us here in the first place.” Despite the structural barriers, Black women continue to lead in entrepreneurship. According to American Express data, Black women are the fastest-growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the U.S., a trend likely to accelerate as traditional pathways constrict. “I don’t want to just survive pregnancy, or layoffs, or discrimination,” Adetosoye told me. “I want to thrive. And thriving means being able to build wealth, plan estates, and contribute fully to the economy.” Castro echoed the same sentiment, this time through the lens of her community. “When I couldn’t find joy in corporate America, I built it myself. That’s what the Unity Block Party is—it’s our refusal to be erased.” This year, she was sure to lean in on the joy element by tapping headliner Durand Bernard, a popular singer that often weaves messages of self-care in his songs. “I am so excited‚” Castro told me. “We need this happiness more than ever.” The exodus of 350,000 Black women from the labor force is more than a statistic—it’s a referendum on whether the U.S. economy values their contributions. For Adetosoye, Castro, and Frye, the answer is to build new systems: of care, of capital, of narrative. “Black women, especially younger generations, like millennials, are resilient,” Frye said. “But resilience should not be the requirement for survival in this economy. We deserve systems that work for us, not against us.”

August 25, 2025 17:54 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=163051&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Can Meta Platforms Stock Hit $800 By The End Of 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/can-meta-platforms-stock-hit-800-by-end-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T19:51:08Z
Full Content:
ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Given Meta Platform’s strong Q2 performance, modest valuation compared to Google and Microsoft, and optimistic growth forecasts, Meta stock is likely to top $800 within weeks. Whether the stock continues to rise depends on whether the company reports Q3 results that beat expectations and raises its forecasts for Q4 growth and profitability. If Meta falls short on Q3 growth or Q4 guidance, the stock could tumble way below $800 by the end of 2025. Read on for a discussion of how much Meta’s stock has risen so far this year, the forces propelling and impeding the company’s growth, how the Facebook parent’s valuation compares to rivals and where analysts see the stock going in the next year. Meta stock has been on a roll. In 2024, shares of the Facebook parent increased 69% – rising from $354 to $600 a share. As of August 25, Meta shares had risen another 26% to $755. With a mere 3% more to rise to reach $800 a share, Meta appears more likely than not to surpass that target by the end of 2025. Meta's strategic focus on artificial intelligence and its strong core advertising business, coupled with a vast user base, present significant growth opportunities for the company. Meta's core ad business remains robust, with strong revenue growth in 2025 driven by AI-enhanced ad targeting, increased advertiser adoption of AI tools and higher engagement across platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Threads. AI integration has led to increased conversion rates for ads, particularly on Reels, according to AInvest. Meta continues to see growth in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads with daily active users growing 6% to 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. Improved content recommendation algorithms and features like Reels contribute to increased time spent on the platforms, further enhancing the advertising opportunity, Zacks noted. Meta's aggressive investments in AI infrastructure, including data centers and AI models like Llama 4, could help the company’s business lines grow. The Meta AI chatbot and assistant are gaining traction, nearing one billion monthly active users, suggesting potential for AI-driven experiences and new revenue streams. Meta's AI strategy also includes AI-powered glasses and potential enterprise applications for businesses, SeekingAlpha wrote. Meta posted 22% revenue growth in the second quarter, showing its core ad business remains strong at a time when the company is investing billions of dollars into AI. The results show the extent to which Meta’s advertising business will continue to pay for its outsize AI ambitions, as well as how the AI tools are contributing to its strength, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meta beat analyst expectations and increased guidance. Sales came in at $47.5 billion, ahead of analyst expectations. Net income for the second quarter was $18.3 billion, also ahead of market expectations. Cost-cutting measures and a focus on efficiency also contributed to Meta’s healthy financial position, the Journal noted. Meta also said it expects to post between 17% and 24% revenue growth for the current quarter. “The investments it’s making in AI are already paying off in its ads business,” eMarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Journal. Meta also faces hurdles — including regulatory pressures, high capital expenditures for AI and the continued losses in its Reality Labs division. Meta faces intense competition in both the social media and digital advertising sectors from established players like Google and emerging platforms like TikTok, as well as from new entrants in AI. TikTok is a significant threat to Meta's social media dominance and the Facebook parent’s ability to attract advertising. Google and OpenAI are key competitors in the development of AI capabilities, particularly regarding large language models, according to Variety. Meta faces many regulatory challenges, particularly in the European Union and the United States. The European Digital Markets Act could reduce Meta’s European ad revenue in the second half of 2025, according to Team SciDA, while an ongoing FTC antitrust lawsuit poses the risk of forced divestitures of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported Wired. The Reality Labs division, Meta's metaverse and VR/AR segment, continues to operate at a significant loss, raising questions about its long-term viability and return on investment. Meta's Reality Labs division reported $4.53 billion in the second quarter of 2025, despite generating $370 million in revenue, according to Digital Music News. This loss is a result of investments in VR and AR technologies, including the Meta Quest headsets and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Meta's increased capital spending for AI infrastructure (estimated between $64 billion and $72 billion for 2025) could pressure margins and profitability in the short term, according to InvestorsObserver. It remains to be seen whether these large capital investments will result in a better return on investment than has the company’s investments in the metaverse — which prompted the company’s name change from Facebook. While sporting a moderate valuation compared to peers, Meta’s stock price, revenue growth, and net margin have outpaced those of Google and Microsoft. Here are the details: Based on short-term price targets offered by 52 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $866.92. The forecasts range from a low of $658.00 to a high of $1,086.00. The average price target represents an increase of 10.84% from the last closing price of $782.13, according to Zacks Research. One analyst was impressed with Meta’s Q2 report – raising his high price target to $900. "What was that? WOW," Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said in a client note featured by Investor’s Business Daily. "Meta destroyed expectations with perhaps one of the biggest prints in their history." Wedbush's Meta stock analyst Scott Devitt raised his price target from $750 to $920, reported IBD. Meta stock needs to rise 3% more to top $800 by the end of 2025. It is likely that will happen as long as Meta beats growth expectations and raises guidance when it presents its next earnings report.

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results.

Title: Nvidia Stock May See Its Biggest Post-Earnings Move in a Year This Week

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong.

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

NVDA earnings date: Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, is set to release its quarterly earnings, influencing Wall Street sentiment significantly.

August 25, 2025 10:53 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025.

August 25, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: CrowdStrike: Buy Or Sell CRWD Stock Ahead of Its Upcoming Earnings?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cybersecurity firm, is slated to release earnings on Wednesday, August 27, 2025. For event-driven traders, reviewing how the stock has behaved around prior earnings announcements can offer useful perspective. Over the past five years, CrowdStrike’s one-day move after earnings has been evenly split between gains and losses. In 50% of instances, the stock posted a positive one-day return with a median gain of 9.8%. In the remaining 50%, it recorded a negative one-day return with a median decline of -5.6%. Although the actual results and management guidance typically drive the largest moves, these historical tendencies can still inform positioning. Given the equal split between positive and negative one-day outcomes, trading solely on the event is challenging. Traders might weigh two broad approaches: While earnings can introduce volatility, the longer-term picture has favored investors: since early January 2021, CrowdStrike has advanced about 100%, rising from roughly $210 to $420, far outpacing the S&P 500’s approximately 70% increase over the same span. Analysts currently expect earnings of $0.83 per share on revenue of $1.15 billion for the latest quarter, versus $1.04 per share on revenue of $964 million a year ago. From a fundamentals angle, CrowdStrike’s market capitalization stands at $104 billion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $4.1 billion in revenue but was not operationally profitable, with operating losses of $252 million and a net loss of $172 million. That being said, if you prefer upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception.

See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk tactic (though not helpful if correlations are weak) is to study relationships between short-term and medium-term moves after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and trade accordingly. For example, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest link, a trader could lean “long” for the following 5 days when the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data using a 5-year history and a more recent 3-year window. Here, 1D_5D denotes the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. At times, peer outcomes can influence post-earnings reactions—sometimes even before the report as expectations get priced in. The chart below compares CrowdStrike’s past post-earnings one-day (1D) returns with peers that reported just ahead of CrowdStrike. Peer returns also reflect post-earnings 1D moves for a fair comparison. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like CrowdStrike, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception.
