We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss. According to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years. “Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. One of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date. In light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper. Moreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis. Intelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars. “What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses artificial intelligence for everything from reinventing shopping experiences to automated ad creatives, streamlining healthcare access, and more with generative AI powered by Amazon Web Services. In its latest step in advancing its reach towards AI, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has struck a five-year deal with startup Databricks, a data and artificial intelligence company. This deal can potentially help businesses looking to cut costs when building their own artificial intelligence capabilities by developing custom generative AI models built with Databricks Mosaic AI on AWS. Databricks will be using Amazon’s Trainium AI chips for powering the training and serving of their large language models, providing joint customers with unmatched scale, performance, and cost-efficiency for their generative AI applications. While many tech analysts and business leaders don’t consider Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a leader in AI innovation, its AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, are helping it change the narrative and that too, cost-efficiently. “Generative AI is disrupting every industry and a company’s data will ultimately be its competitive advantage. Strengthening our collaboration with AWS allows us to provide customers with unmatched scale and price-performance so they can bring their own generative AI applications to market more rapidly”. -Ali Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO at Databricks. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st among the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The company has integrated AI-powered capabilities across many of its products, introduced a $1 billion fund earlier this year to invest in AI startups, and even maintains a strong foothold in cybersecurity, offering AI-powered security tools, and much more. On Wednesday, October 16, Citigroup analysts upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Neutral” and raised the price target to $62 from $52 per share. This reflects an estimated 15% upside from Tuesday’s close. According to Citi analysts, investors shouldn’t overlook the artificial intelligence potential of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The upgrade in the networking company’s shares by analyst Atif Malik highlights a narrowing valuation gap relative to peers, as well as a rapidly expanding AI Ethernet total addressable market that is projected to reach $10 billion by 2025. “While AI is currently a small piece of the biz (~2% of revs), we see the potential for a stronger contribution,” he wrote. “With more AI coming, we are incrementally more constructive on the group and expect continued investor rotation out of semis/hardware into networking equipment to benefit group valuation.” Furthermore, the addition of the company’s products in Meta Platforms’ AI hardware comes as a “positive validation of CSCO’s technology.” With at least three major hyperscalers already using its tools in their backend networks, Malik believes that the company’s $9 billion 2027 hyperscaler AI opportunity forecast may be “potentially understated”. The analyst has also increased his earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 2% and 5%, respectively. “We believe shares warrant a sizable discount to networking peer valuation to reflect lingering share loss concerns, somewhat tempered by growing AI opportunities.

This increase follows a five-year low of 3.65% in August. 2)The food inflation, which accounts for around half of the overall CPI basket, jumped to 9.24 per cent in September from 5.66 per cent in the previous month, the data showed. The inflation rate for vegetables grew 35.99 per cent in August as against 10.71 per cent in the previous month, while pulses & products inflation eased to 9.81 per cent as against 13.6 per cent in August. 3)Rural inflation quickened to 5.87 per cent as against 4.16 per cent in August, whereas urban inflation accelerated to 5.05 per cent as compared to 3.14 per cent in the previous month. 4)India’s wholesale inflation rose to 1.84% in September from 1.31% in August, driven by changes in the Wholesale Price Index covering primary articles, fuel, and manufactured products. The RBI’s MPC retained the repo rate and adjusted inflation projections, maintaining a neutral stance amidst varied inflation and growth trends. 5)India’s forex reserves contracted by $10.7 billion to $690 billion as of October 11, with foreign currency assets reducing by $10.5 billion to $602 billion. Gold reserves and SDRs also saw a dip, while the RBI continues managing market volatility to prevent steep rupee depreciation. 6)India’s merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a five-month low of $20.78 billion in September as imports grew at the slowest pace in six months and exports rose marginally after two months of decline, the official data showed. The trade deficit, or the gap between imports and exports, had widened to a 10-month high of $29.65 billion in August. Goods worth $55.36 billion were imported last month, up 1.62 per cent compared to the year-ago period, amid softening global petroleum prices. In September, exports rose by 0.5 per cent to $34.58 billion due to muted global demand amid geopolitical challenges, according to the data. 7)According to Primedatabase, in H1FY25, funds raised by NBFCs from debt capital markets totaled to Rs 3.23 trillion, up 3.11 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) during the same period last year. In 2024 so far (upto September), this number adds up to Rs 5.09 trillion, up almost 4 per cent Y-o-Y. 8)India’s GDP is expected to grow at 6.95% in the current financial year, which is about 25 basis points (bps) lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forecast, according to a note by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). 9)At the India Credit Forum hosted by Bloomberg, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das addressed key economic concerns, stating that inflation in October is expected to remain sticky but may ease in November and December, although upside risks persist. He emphasized that the RBI is not behind the curve on policy rates and the upcoming December decision will hinge on the inflation outlook rather than external factors like U.S. elections. Das clarified that the RBI doesn’t manage exchange rates but responds to market demand and supply, countering market assumptions. Regarding growth, he highlighted that India, as a large economy, must rely on multiple growth levers, not solely manufacturing or services. He also noted the need for more institutional investors, especially Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), in India’s bond markets, where only 15% of the allocated space is currently utilized. However, FIIs’ biggest hurdle remains the complex KYC process and UBO declarations, which are constrained by FATF regulations. 10)The mutual fund industry AUM hit an all-time high of Rs 67.90 lakh crore in September, led by net inflows across open-ended categories and mark-to-market (MTM) gains in the equity market. The industry’s AUM increased from Rs 66.70 lakh crore in August, reflecting growth of Rs 0.39 lakh crore or 0.58% over the previous month, according to a monthly note by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). WORLD 1)OPEC said in its monthly report that the world oil demand will rise by 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 -106,000 barrels per day less previously estimated, or the growth of 2.03 million bpd it expected last month. 2)As of October 17, 2024, the US initial jobless claims were 241,000, which is a 7.31% decrease from the previous week and a 14.22% increase from one year ago. 3)The price index for US exports fell 2.1% year-on-year in September, the largest 12-month decrease since January 2024. This was due to lower prices for nonagricultural exports, which more than offset higher agricultural export prices. The price index for US imports fell 0.1% year-on-year in September. This was due to cheaper energy products. 4)Retail Sales in the United States increased 1.7% year-on-year in September 2024, the smallest yearly gain since January, following an upwardly revised 2.2% rise in August. Retail Sales YoY in the United States averaged 4.74 percent from 1993 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 52.50 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -19.90 percent in April of 2020. 5)Industrial Production in the United States decreased 0.6% year-on-year in September 2024, the biggest decline in five months, following a downwardly revised 0.2% fall in August. Mining sank 2.2% and manufacturing contracted 0.5% while production of utilities increased 0.6%. 6)The United States saw a 0.5% year-on-year decline in manufacturing production in September 2024, following a downwardly revised flat reading in August. Over the long term, U.S. manufacturing production has averaged 3.56% from 1920 to 2024, with an all-time high of 67.90% in July 1933 and a record low of -39.40% in February 1946. 7)The United Kingdom’s (UK) ILO Unemployment Rate eased to 4.0% in the three months to August, following July’s 4.1% reading, the data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Additional details of the report showed that the number of people claiming jobless benefits increased by 27.9K in September, compared with a gain of 23.7K in August, missing the expected 20.2K print. 8)The annual inflation rate in the UK fell to 1.7% in September 2024, the lowest reading since April 2021 and driven down by lower airfare and petrol prices, compared to 2.2% in each of the previous two months and forecasts of 1.9%. Meanwhile the core inflation rate fell to 3.2% from 3.6% in the previous months. 9)In the UK, producer input prices fell by 2.3% in September 2024, further declining from a revised decrease of 1.0% in August, while producer output (factory gate) prices dropped by 0.7%, down from a revised increase of 0.3% in the previous month. On a monthly basis, input prices decreased by 1.0%, and output prices fell by 0.5% in September 2024. In contrast, UK services producer prices rose by 3.3% in the year to Quarter 3 (July to September) 2024, slightly up from a revised increase of 3.2% in Quarter 2 (April to June). 10)The Retail Price Index in the United Kingdom advanced by 2.7% year-on-year in September 2024, easing from a 3.5% rise in the previous month and below market expectations of a 3.1% gain. On a monthly basis, the RPI fell by 0.3%, reversing from a 0.6% increase in the prior period and compared to market forecasts of a 0.1% rise. 11)The Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be decreased to 3.25%, 3.40% and 3.65% respectively, with effect from 23 October 2024. 12)The euro area annual inflation rate was 1.7% in September 2024, down from 2.2% in August. A year earlier, the rate was 4.3%. European Union annual inflation was 2.1% in September 2024, down from 2.4% in August. The core inflation rate in the Eurozone was 2.7% in September 2024, down from 2.8% in August 2024. 13)The Euro Area recorded a trade surplus of 4583.60 EUR Million in August of 2024. Balance of Trade in Euro Area averaged 5584.95 EUR Million from 1999 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 29946.10 EUR Million in July of 2015 and a record low of -55033.30 EUR Million in August of 2022. 14)Japan’s trade balance shifted to a deficit of JPY 294.24 billion in September 2024 from a surplus of JPY 60.56 billion in the same month a year earlier. It was the third straight month of a trade gap, coming in worse than market forecast of a shortfall of JPY 237.6 billion, with exports unexpectedly shrinking while imports grew. Sales declined by 1.7% to JPY 9,038.20 billion, marking the first drop since November 2023 and missing consensus of a 0.5% rise. Meantime, imports rose 2.1% to JPY 9,332.55 billion, pointing to the sixth straight month of expansion but falling short of estimates of 3.2%. 15)Japanese inflation slowed in September with prices up 2.4 percent on-year, not including volatile fresh food, official data showed Friday. The core Consumer Price Index eased from 2.8 percent to 2.4% percent in August as the pace of increase in electricity and gas prices relented, the internal affairs ministry said. 16)China’s debt-to-GDP ratio hit a jaw-dropping 366% in Q1 2024, a new all-time high. Since the 2008 Financial Crisis, the ratio has doubled. To put this differently, for 1 unit of GDP, the Chinese economy has produced 3.66 units of debt burden. 17)China recorded a trade surplus of 81.71 USD Billion in September of 2024. Balance of Trade in China averaged 16.08 USD Billion from 1981 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 125.16 USD Billion in February of 2024 and a record low of -61.99 USD Billion in February of 2020. 18)The Chinese economy expanded 4.6% yoy in Q3 of 2024, compared with market forecasts of 4.5% and a 4.7% rise in Q2. It marked the slowest annual growth rate since Q1 2023, amid persistent property weakness, shaky domestic demand, deflation risks, and trade frictions with the West. 19)China’s retail sales climbed by 3.2% year-on-year in September 2024 from 2.1% gain in the previous month, easily beating market estimates of 2.5% rise. 20)In September 2024, China’s industrial production increased by 5.4% year-on-year, which was higher than the 4.6% market forecast and the 4.5% increase in August. This was the fastest expansion in industrial output since May and the first acceleration in five months. 21)China’s surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in September 2024, compared to market estimates and August’s reading of 5.3%. This marks the lowest reading in three months. The jobless rate for locally registered residents decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 5.2%, at which non-local registrants had a rate of 4.8%, while the rate for non-local agricultural registrants stood at 4.6%. In 31 major cities, the urban unemployment rate was also 5.1%. 22)The Philippine central bank reduced its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday for a second meeting and left the door open to further cuts with medium-term inflation expected to stay within its 2%-4% target range.

and Sensex clocked new peaks in September, with the former crossing the psychological 26,000 mark. A bumper rate cut by the US Fed and a resilient American economy bolstered investors’ confidence. FIIs remained net sellers in domestic equities for the fourth consecutive month. Yet, the markets had a hard landing as they set foot into October, facing the sharpest decline since June. Rising tensions in the Middle East and a fresh set of derivative norms did dent sentiments. But the key trigger for correction was the huge selling pressure by FIIs in early October. The massive stimulus by the Chinese government created an opportunity for hot money to look for tactical trade in terms of buying China at the expense of other emerging markets. In fact, the selloffs from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) amounted to Rs. 27,142 crore in just the first three days of October, leading to a decline of 5-5.5% in the Nifty from its recent peak. Fortunately, the BJP pulled off a miraculous victory in Haryana state elections that suddenly changed the mood in the Indian equity markets. The opposition had the advantage of a two-term incumbency against the ruling party, BJP, along with some other crucial factors. However, the BJP has romped home with a comfortable majority which is far ahead of even the most optimistic expectations. The victory in Haryana would boost confidence of their cadre in Delhi and Maharashtra – the two states scheduled to go for elections soon. In terms of events ahead, the market has to deal with Q2 results season, which is likely to turn out to be another quarter of muted growth in Nifty earnings. The consensus is building 4-4.5% growth in the Nifty earnings due to high base effect, pressure on margins and moderation in earnings growth in heavyweight sectors such as banking and energy. Globally, there are elections scheduled in the US. Also, the market would want to watch for progress in the rate cut cycle along with impact of the intensifying Middle East crisis on the crude oil and commodity prices. Given the macro environment and valuation concerns post the rally in post couple of months, it would be healthy if the markets take a breather and consolidate in a range. Moreover, the stock-specific volatility could rise in the Q2 result season as some of the pockets of stocks in the broader market do look overheated with little valuation comfort at the current level. The consolidation phase could offer an opportunity for investors to accumulate good quality stocks at prices that are 10-25% lower than their recent peak. Do keep the big picture in mind. The Indian economy is on a multi-year upcycle with all engines of growth firing like rising infrastructure spending, real estate upturn and beginning of a new privatesector capex cycle.

BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, accumulated about 5,805 BTC tokens within 24 hours, with its inflows exceeding $393 million. Following BlackRock’s IBIT’s impressive performance, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs have hit net inflows of over 20 billion since their launch. Meanwhile, Quantity Funds launched its STKD Bitcoin and Gold ETF, BTGD, due to the increasing demand for these assets. BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has recorded a new milestone: It accumulated 5,805 BTC, with about $393.4 million in net inflows. This feat demonstrates IBIT’s dominance in the ETF market. IBIT now leads the market by 50% in value to its immediate follow-up fund, Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $10.24 billion in net inflows. IBIT has amassed over $22.49 billion in net inflows since its debut, according to data from Farside Investors. Also, Wednesday proved to be a fruitful day as most Bitcoin ETFs posted impressive positive flows. The spot BTC ETFs scooped about $458.5 million in net inflows, and no ETF posted negative net flows for the day. Fidelity’s FBTC closed the day with net inflows of $14.8 million, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $12.9 million in net inflows. ARK Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB and Franklin’s EXBC amassed about $11.5 million and $11.8 million in net inflows, respectively. Meanwhile, Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO, VanEck’s HODL, and Valkyrie’s BRRR recorded $6.8 million, $5.5 million, and $1.9 million in net inflows, respectively. However, the remaining three ETFs, including Grayscale’s GBTC, saw zero daily net flows. On Wednesday, the daily trading volume of all the spot Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $1.58 billion, a 48.1% decrease from the previous day’s trade volume of $3.05 billion. Following the impressive trading day on Wednesday, the spot BTC ETFs have net inflows of $20.19 billion since their launch. The ETF market has recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin and Gold ETFs. This trend prompted the emergence of the STKD Bitcoin & Gold ETF, a fund that offers exposure to both. Quantity Funds partnered with Return Stacked to launch STKD Bitcoin & Gold ETF. According to the announcement, STKD offers protection against inflation and currency debasement. Further, Quantity Funds revealed that its Bitcoin & Gold ETF will trade with the ticker BTGD. The ETF will expose investors to BTC and Gold via BTC futures, gold futures, and their related ETFs. Moreover, retail investors will gain 100% exposure to the ETF’s joint Bitcoin and Gold strategy for each $1 invested. The firm stated: “The bitcoin strategy seeks to capture the price return of bitcoin, investing in BTC futures and ETPs, while the gold strategy similarly seeks to capture the price return of gold via investments in gold futures and gold ETPs.” Your email address will not be published.

Title: Should you buy Nvidia stock now? It may be a once-in-a-generation opportunity

Nvidia has been one of the most hyped and closely followed stocks in recent memory as the fortunes of the broader market increasingly hinge on the AI chip leader. At one point this year, the stock accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains, and some investors even held watch parties for Nvidia’s earnings release. Nvidia’s astronomical run to a $3 trillion company has also been somewhat divisive as many on Wall Street have doubted that the stock can sustain further gains while others see the AI boom fueling more upside. That’s left investors asking, “Should I buy Nvidia stock right now, or sell it?” Analysts at Bank of America have an answer: In a note on Thursday, they reiterated their buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised their price target to $190 from $165, implying it could soar 38% higher from Friday’s closing price. At $190 a share, Nvidia’s market cap would also explode to $4.7 trillion, from $3.4 trillion today. In fact, BofA is so bullish on Nvidia stock that analysts called it a “generational opportunity,” estimating a total addressable market of more than $400 billion for AI accelerators. “AI models (demand) continue to evolve, with the cadence of new LLM model launches now increased to 3-5 times/yr per developer (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), and each new major generation requiring 10-20x compute requirement to train,” analysts said. Their confidence in Nvidia has been boosted by others in the chip sector like Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML, which both recently signaled strong AI demand. BofA’s meetings with executives at Broadcom and Micron as well as comments from AMD have yielded similar indications. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also touted huge demand for the company’s next-generation AI chip. “Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,” he told CNBC earlier this month. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.” Adding to BofA’s bullish case for Nvidia is its underappreciated enterprise partnerships with the likes of Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft, and others as well as its software products that help reinforce Nvidia’s dominance in hardware. They combine to create a deeper overall Nvidia ecosystem for AI. Plus, Nvidia could generate more than $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, rivaling even Apple, BofA estimated. Earnings reports later this month from tech giants that are developing AI technologies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, should provide more insight into demand. And Nvidia is due to report Nov. 20. While some on Wall Street have expressed skepticism on whether massive investments in AI are translating to the bottom line, the tech sector is locked in a cutthroat race to be first on the scene with the latest advances in AI. “We continue to see the pace of new model development increase,” BofA said. “LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

U.Today - Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly reached highs of $69,000 before retreating. In Friday's trading session, the largest cryptocurrency reached a high of $69,000, its highest level since July 29, when Bitcoin last traded at $70,000. At the time of writing, BTC was up 0.17% in the last 24 hours to $68,277 and up 9% weekly. Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing price comeback might have prompted global investors to seek exposure to exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to the leading cryptocurrency as seen in a remarkable increase in inflows. In particular, U.S.-listed spot ETFs have seen a strong uptake, pulling in $2 billion in investor money in the week just concluded, according to Arkham Intelligence. In a major milestone, On Oct. 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized applications from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to list the much-awaited options for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is the largest ETF week since March, indicating a revived interest and confidence in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs were initially approved in the United States in January. The top contributors to this large inflow include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, ARK Invest and Bitwise. BlackRock led the push in Bitcoin acquisitions, adding a staggering $1.14 billion to its holdings. Other significant players in the ETF space also ramped up their Bitcoin acquisitions: Fidelity boosted its holdings by $319 million; ARK Invest added $306 million while Bitwise increased its Bitcoin portfolio by $150 million. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,797 in March after soaring for weeks amid optimism on demand for Bitcoin ETFs. The price then fell by more than 30% by early August, before commencing on the present bull market run. This article was originally published on U.Today

Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at Blackrock, walks in Times ... [+] Square after ringing the opening bell as Bitcoin Spot ETF's are launched on the Nasdaq Exchange. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted approval to Nasdaq ISE to list and trade options on Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), marking a significant step toward bringing regulated bitcoin options to the U.S. market. Although most retail investors who own bitcoin will not utilize this financial instrument, its availability in the U.S. may impact the adoption, liquidity, and volatility of bitcoin. This development promises to further ingrain bitcoin into the global financial system and support continued growth of the bitcoin network – and will forever change the way bitcoin is utilized as a part of an overall investment portfolio. Similar financial instruments have been available for a while, but until now they have only available on platforms outside the U.S., like Deribit. However, the approval from the SEC for IBIT options means that investors in the U.S. will have access to these contracts within a regulated framework. The U.S. has long been considered the leader in global finance, boasting the largest and most liquid equity and debt markets, with a wide range of financial instruments and a diverse investor base. By approving bitcoin ETF options in these markets, regulators will allow bitcoin investors unprecedented access to robust financial tools to manage risk and exposure. And, as institutional players like hedge funds and pension funds begin using bitcoin options, liquidity in the market will naturally increase, making it easier for large-scale trades to occur without destabilizing the asset’s price. Bitcoin options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell bitcoin at a predetermined price within a certain time frame. For institutional investors, these options provide a means to hedge against price volatility or to speculate on market movements without needing to hold the underlying asset. With options trading, investors can now hedge their bitcoin exposure more effectively or amplify potential returns through leverage. This flexibility may attract a wider variety of participants, offering new ways to approach bitcoin price exposure without directly buying the asset itself. In the future, regulated bitcoin options in the U.S. may lead to significant growth in its synthetic notional value, which refers to the total value of outstanding derivative contracts in the market. As options trading expands, the notional value tied to bitcoin could increase substantially, without requiring physical bitcoin to be bought or sold. This opens up a new avenue for market engagement while amplifying bitcoin’s influence in the global economy. IBIT options will be subject to existing ETF option trading rules, including criteria around listing, margin requirements, and trading halts, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into the broader financial system. The approved rule includes strict position and exercise limits, capping positions at 25,000 contracts. This limit is notably conservative compared to other ETFs – some of which have limits as high as 250,000 contracts – and was designed to minimize the risk of market manipulation. Additionally, the SEC and Nasdaq ISE have implemented robust surveillance and reporting mechanisms, ensuring that trades are carefully monitored for any signs of fraud or manipulation. The regulatory framework also includes access to surveillance from the CME’s bitcoin futures market, providing real-time oversight that tracks both the futures and spot markets, which are highly correlated. These options will be physically settled and follow the American-style exercise method, meaning they can be exercised at any point before their expiration. Bitcoin options offer a sophisticated way to manage risk and hedge exposure to its volatility. A common hedging strategy involves purchasing put options, which give you the right to sell bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a specific time frame. This allows you to protect against a potential decline in bitcoin’s price. For example, if you hold a significant amount of bitcoin and grow concerned about a short-term price drop, you could buy a put option. If bitcoin's price falls below the strike price, the put option can be exercised, letting you sell the bitcoin at the higher strike price and limiting your losses. On the other hand, call options are used to hedge missed opportunities or upside potential. By buying a call option, you secure the right to buy bitcoin at a specified price if its market value rises, allowing you to participate in gains without fully exposing yourself to the asset’s volatility upfront. Both of these strategies allow you to manage your bitcoin positions more precisely, without being forced to sell the underlying asset in a downturn or miss out on potential profits during upward trends. Improved liquidity resulting from the introduction of bitcoin ETF options will have an effect on the volatility of its price. When a market has higher liquidity, larger trades can occur without significantly affecting the price of the asset. This is because more liquidity means there are more buyers and sellers available at any given time, which dampens the effect of any single transaction on the overall market. In the context of bitcoin, options provide institutional investors with tools to hedge their positions or take on exposure in a controlled manner, leading to more frequent but less disruptive trading activity. Additionally, the presence of options increases the number of market participants, each utilizing different strategies, from hedging to speculation, which adds layers of complexity to price discovery. As a result, liquidity is more evenly distributed across the market, reducing sharp price swings driven by low-volume trades. The SEC’s approval of bitcoin ETF options is a signal that bitcoin is gaining traction within the regulated financial system. As institutions gain more access to regulated financial products that include bitcoin, it will continue to mature and integrate into the financial system. With institutional adoption ramping up, the path forward for bitcoin looks bright. As more funds and institutional players enter the options market, bitcoin’s liquidity and market stability will likely improve, making it a more attractive asset for conservative investors. This will amplify the influx of institutional capital, further smoothing out bitcoin’s historically wild price swings, encouraging even greater participation. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Cork SHC Final: Imokilly’s final-quarter blitz ends Sarsfields stay as champions

There was a brief yahoo from the stands at the final whistle, but no pitch invasion or dam burst of emotion. Imokilly, a powerful divisional team composed of junior and intermediate players from east Cork, have many admirers but not many invested followers. With a clinical second-half performance they won their sixth county title, dethroning last year’s winners Sars, and dominating the final just as they had lorded the knock-out phase of the championship in recent weeks. Playing with the gale, Imokilly rattled off 10 points without reply in the final quarter, crushing what remained of Sars’ resistance. The defending champions led by just six points at half-time, and even if it was impossible to estimate how much the gale was worth, six points felt like a cocktail umbrella in a storm. In the event they were on the sharp end of a 15-point swing. As a divisional team Imokilly cannot represent Cork in the Munster club championship, and in recent weeks a debate about the continued desirability of divisional teams in the Cork championship has surfaced again. At the moment Imokilly are incredibly powerful with an array of players with intercounty pedigree, past and present. Ciarán Joyce, Cork’s brilliant centre back, was imperious in the Imokilly half-back line. Séamus Harnedy, who had a resurgent season with Cork, thundered into the game in the second half. Elsewhere on the field were Bill Cooper, Brian Lawton and John Cronin, all of whom had played senior championship for Cork. The heart and lungs of the team, though, are seven or eight young players who had won Under-20 All-Irelands with Cork in recent years. Among them was the man of the match, Jack Leahy, who was terrific in the corner and racked up 11 points, three from play. Outside him, Diarmuid Leahy is an emerging player who will surely play for Cork in the National League in the new year. For a divisional team, though, the unity in the group is undeniable. “People are saying all year, ye’re only a division,” said Joyce afterwards, “but literally, tonight, when we’re going out we’re like a club, we all get on very well. Even at half-time we were only saying to ourselves how great we get on. It showed in the second half there, we were fighting for every ball like we’re a club.” In the end, Sars couldn’t hold back the tide. Their half-time lead was wiped out 10 minutes into the second half, and they did exceptionally well to still be level 10 minutes later. Imokilly’s goal, though, three minutes into the second half, changed the tone of the game. Daniel Kearney was dispossessed by Cooper, 30 yards from his own goal, and with no covering defenders in his path, Adam Murphy had an unimpeded run. His finish was high and fierce. Overall, the conditions were a menace. A gale blew towards the Blackrock end, extending the scoring zone to about 100 metres. Eoin Davis, the Imokilly goalkeeper, had a wide from a puck-out in the second half, and shortly afterwards landed a free from just outside the D. The uprights at both ends swayed like backing singers. There must have been a strong case for postponement, but that decision would have been complicated by the significant number of Imokilly players still involved in unfinished championships with their clubs. One of the original selling points for the split season was that the latter stages of county championships would be played out in kinder weather, but October has turned into a treacherous month, and county finals all over the country are routinely stalked by the colour card of weather warnings now. Sars played with the elements in the first half, but they struggled to get into a rhythm with their shooting and reached half-time with more wides, 12, than points, 11. Conor O’Sullivan and Paul Leopold, their two corner backs, both scored without having to stray far from home. Sars had eight different scorers in the first half, but they failed to threaten a goal when they really needed something to give an adrenaline shot to their scoring rate. Having won the toss Imokilly decided to play against the gale in the first half, and trailing by just 0-11 to 0-5 at the break, that gambit had paid off. “It was fairly manageable with that wind,” said Joyce. “Obviously we knew the quality we had in the dressingroom. We’re star-studded at the moment so we knew we’d get over the line. It’s all about confidence, these type of games.” Sars failed to score for 13 minutes in the final quarter, and in that time Imokilly put the game to bed. Shane Hegarty scored twice inside a minute to give Imokilly the lead for just the second time with 10 minutes left and from there they took flight. IMOKILLY: E Davis (0-1, f); C O’Brien, M Russell, T Wilk; D O’Leary, C Joyce, J Cronin; S Hegarty (0-3), B Cooper; D Healy (0-1), S Harnedy (0-2), Brian Lawton; A Murphy (1-0), S Desmond (0-3), J Leahy (0-11, 7f, 1 65).

Title: NVIDIA (NVDA): Among the Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks. In an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop. He also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market. Regarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform. Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data. Lee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction. Regarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins. While some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 10-Year Net Income CAGR: 58.47% TTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and a pioneer in AI, gaming, and data center technology. The company’s GPUs are widely utilized in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have been adopted across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and finance. Notable customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is positioned for ongoing growth, driven by its strong presence in the data center market and the upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is highly sought after by companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, who are building AI data centers to support their products. The Blackwell GPUs, priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, are already being distributed to data centers and industrial customers for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025. In a CNBC interview, CEO Jensen Huang remarked that "Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane," adding, "Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first." NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in accelerated computing and generative AI is also a key factor in its growth outlook. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to benefit from the expanding enterprise AI market, along with growing opportunities in the automotive and healthcare sectors, as its products and solutions gain traction in these areas. In Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure rose by 19% year-over-year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend approximately $160 billion on AI infrastructure in 2024. With its robust position in the data center market and emerging opportunities in various industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth. Analysts estimate that the company’s earnings will grow by 81.88% this year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $148.53, which represents a 12.08% upside potential from its current level. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin Dominance Overshadows Several Important Crypto Trends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/20/bitcoin-dominance-overshadows-several-important-crypto-trends/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T17:45:44Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's market dominance is at the highest levels in years Bitcoin continues to march toward all-time-highs that were only reached earlier in 2024, although the volatility that the token has experienced in the run-up to the U.S. Presidential election has been elevated when compared to prior periods in the year. Regardless of the volatile rise, the fact remains that the price of bitcoin and bitcoin interest continues to move in positive directions in spite of short-term setbacks. Alongside the growing interest and investment into the crypto sector by both major political parties the crypto sector has experienced an upswing in price, trading volume, and investor sentiment. As has occurred during previous bull markets, a rising tide in the crypto sector at large has led to a re-establishment of bitcoin dominance and leadership. Specifically, the share of total market capitalization captured by bitcoin, used to determine the dominance of bitcoin has risen to approximately 60% as of October 2024 which is the highest level since April of 2022. Following the declines in crypto prices overall in 2022 – and bottoming out with the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the market share of bitcoin has continued to steadily increase since those events. In addition to the market capitalization aspect of market leadership it is worth pointing out that the institutional inflows and interest coming into crypto have continued to be centered around bitcoin. For example, while both bitcoin and ether have spot ETFs products at this point, the bitcoin ETFs have attracted $18.9 billion while ether ETFs have attracted a substantially lower amount. Given all of that investors might be surprised to learn about several other major developments in the crypto sector. Let’s take a look at a few of the headlines that market watchers might have overlooked. With the rising price of bitcoin, the steady inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, and the fact that legislation has been put forward advocating for a strategic bitcoin reserve it would be relatively straightforward for investors and policymakers to relegate stablecoins to the back burner. Doing so, however, would be ignoring a slice of the cryptoasset sector that continues to not only grow in market capitalization, but also would ignore a potential on-ramp for millions of new crypto users. USDT and USDC continue to dominate the stablecoin sector, with the former retaining its position as the largest and most commonly used stablecoin and the latter continuing to rank among the most trusted cryptoasset by the TradFi community. Despite doubts connected to business models, the ability to the issuing institutions to weather higher interest rates, and the looming potential of a CBDC stablecoins continue to represent the crypto of choice for users seeking to utilize crypto as a medium of exchange, as on on-ramp to crypto for non-expert investors, and as the crypto of choice for TradFi institutions looking for exposure in the crypto space. These facts exclude the reality that PayPal, a payment processor with household name recognition in the U.S. and abroad, has launched a stablecoin and is allowing individuals and merchants to buy, sell, and hold cryptoassets, including PYUSD. Spot crypto ETFs were a goal that crypto advocates, investors, and entrepreneurs and the approval of both bitcoin and ether ETFs in the same calendar year was – justifiably so – seen as a major victory for the crypto sector. That said, bitcoin spot ETFs introduce several tax considerations unique to cryptocurrency and its classification by tax authorities. With a Bitcoin spot ETF, investors may face capital gains taxes when they sell shares, similar to other ETFs. However, since the ETF holds actual Bitcoin, additional complexity arises regarding cost basis tracking for the fund's transactions, specifically as the coming changes to the IRS code make crypto tax reporting and compliance both more complicated and costly. Another challenge is the taxation of in-kind redemptions, where Bitcoin might be delivered directly to investors, triggering taxable events. Moreover, the frequent fluctuations in Bitcoin prices can lead to short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates than long-term gains. In addition, investors should take into account the implications of international tax laws if the ETF is traded abroad, as crypto regulations and tax treatments vary by country. One of the most under-discussed trends of the recent crypto bull market has been how the centralization of crypto, and bitcoin specifically, has continued unabated and how it has accelerated in many cases. Even as the announcements and launches of bitcoin related or even bitcoin adjacent products and services propel the price per token to higher levels, the reality is the supply of bitcoin, bitcoin sentiment, and the crypto market overall continue to become centralized. Punctuating this reality are the actions taken by nation states such as El Salvador and Bhutan, which are both accumulating strategic reserves of bitcoin, the moves by global financial services leaders such as Blackrock and Fidelity into the bitcoin space, and the appetite that bitcoin tradeable products has fulfilled for investors. Centralization was always going to be a component of mass market adoption, but proponents of nation-state strategies for bitcoin should be wary of undermining one of the core tenets and appeals of the asset. Bitcoin has reestablished itself as the leading cryptoasset, but these dominance levels can overshadow important trends for crypto investors. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Clontarf’s unbeaten AIL run ends with defeat to dominant Terenure

And then there were none. The last unbeaten record in Division 1A of the Energia AIL ended when Clontarf were beaten 28-10 at Castle Avenue by a dominant Terenure. In another meeting between the big four of the last few seasons, Lansdowne beat champions Cork Con 27-10. Harrison Brewer, Adam Melia and Jordan Coughlan, as usual, revelling on home turf, were at their best as Terenure roared into an 18-0 lead thanks to tries by Henry McErlean and Chris Cosgrave before coughing up an intercept try. Winger Craig Adams finished a superb strike move from a scrum on their own 22 instigated by the footwork and offload of Leinster’s Austrian academy out-half Casper Gabriel and another try-scoring assist by Adam La Grue. The visitors were disappointed not to add a bonus point try in the last half-hour, meaning Clontarf stayed top by a point. A feature of the day was the contributions of so many players returning from the Emerging Ireland tour, for example, the Charlie Tector show at the Aviva backpitch. Although reinventing himself as a centre with Leinster, the ex-Ireland under-20 outhalf enjoyed his return to 10, scoring 22 points with two tries and five kicks from five. Yet Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley was man of the match for the way he controlled the match. Captain Jack Cooke also scored as they roared into a 17-3 interval lead and as their excellent defence kept Con at arm’s length they were also a little disappointed not to register a bonus point. The other three games were all decided by kicks in the last minute. Conor Rankin held his nerve to convert a second maul try by Clayton Mulligan to seal Ballynahinch’s 26-25 win away to Young Munster while the St Mary’s centre Mick O’Gara and UCD outhalf and captain James Tarrant earned 25-22 wins at home to Garryowen and away to City of Armagh. The top-of-the-table 1B clash enabled Old Belvedere to move top with a 32-31 win at newly promoted Nenagh Ormond. Corinthians’ amalgam of recent and prospective under-20 internationals were at their free-flowing best as they, Cashel and Instonians maintained their perfect records in 2A. Orin Burke finished off two of Corinthians’ four first-half tries after flurries of offloads and sidestepping before 6ft 10in lock Bryan Walsh beat five defenders in a barnstorming 35-minute charge to score their sixth of seven. Next Saturday Corinthians host Instonians, who have won 38 of their last 40 AIL matches, one of the two exceptions being in Corinthian Park last season.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other IoT stocks. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion. The rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers. IoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments. IoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.

Wi-Fi accounts for 31% of all IoT connections. On the other hand, Bluetooth is used by 25% of connected IoT devices, and cellular IoT, including 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, accounts for nearly 21% of global IoT connections. A key trend in the IoT market for 2024 is the integration of AI technologies, including generative AI and edge AI, into IoT devices. Edge AI, in particular, is transforming the IoT landscape. By allowing IoT devices to process and store data locally, edge AI reduces lag and allows real-time responses. Incorporating AI into IoT devices within industries offers numerous benefits, including improved operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. It plays an important role in predictive maintenance and supply chain management. The future of IoT looks promising. Businesses and investors can expect significant returns as the technology continues to evolve. Keeping this context in mind, let’s take a look at the best IoT stocks to buy now. To create our list of the 10 best IoT stocks to buy, we focused on companies that offer IoT solutions or products, including firms involved in manufacturing IoT devices and hardware. The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds. The best IoT stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the tech giant formerly known as Facebook, has been taking significant steps to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its social media platforms. The company's recent introduction of AI-powered image editing tools and new chat stickers on Instagram is a prime example of this strategy. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive financial performance over the past decade, with a compound annual revenue growth rate of 29.7%. As the global digital ad market is going to expand significantly, reaching over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has maintained an average operating margin of 34.8% in the past five years. These strong financials are fueled by cost-cutting measures and a focus on operational efficiency. Meta's substantial cash reserves of $58.1 billion and free cash flow generation of $10.9 billion reported during the most recent quarter enable it to invest aggressively in AI initiatives. The stock has received a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from analysts. Here’s what Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns. Overall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best IoT stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The US Consumer Is Healthy And This 10% Dividend Will Profit
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/10/20/the-us-consumer-is-healthy-and-this-10-dividend-will-profit/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T13:59:00Z
Full Content:
Strengthening and building your savings Last year, the White House published a blog post titled “As the US Consumer Goes, So Goes the US Economy.” No matter what your politics are, I think we can all agree that America’s economy depends on consumers buying things. For us income investors, then, the consumer’s health is a key thing to watch, as it ultimately sets the direction of stocks. So how healthy is the US consumer today, and can we confidently buy stocks—and better still, high-yielding CEFs like the one we’ll talk about below (current yield: 10%)? Often, the signals are murky. America is, after all, a big country with a lot of people in it, and some of those people are obviously doing better than others, so it’s tricky to zero in on the overall health of consumers. Still, there are some things every consumer is sensitive to and, ultimately, will affect everyone’s spending. The biggest variable, as you can likely guess, is inflation. Inflation/SPY In 2021, as we all know well, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (in orange above) started climbing. That caused stocks to tank in 2022, as spiraling prices of everyday things forced pretty well everyone, no matter how rich, to cut back to varying degrees. But see how the orange line kept going down? The CPI is now back around pre-pandemic levels. With that in mind, you’d expect US consumers to boost their spending again. And they have. Fun Spending This is an obscure metric, but it’s important: how much Americans spend on recreation services (think movie tickets, concerts, hotels, amusement parks and such). After the pandemic slump, inflation slowed the recovery to the pre-pandemic trendline in 2021 and 2022. Growth recovered in 2023 and has kept strengthening so far in 2024. In short, Americans have more money to spend on fun because 2022’s inflationary pressures have started to ebb. Here’s another interesting chart on the health of the consumer: Household Debt/Income What this shows us is that, if you take the average US household and count up its debt, the total amounts to less than 100% of their disposable (or after-tax) income. In other words, putting 100% of that income toward their debt could erase their borrowings in less than a year (which is obviously impossible but useful for context here). Contrast that with other wealthy nations, like Canada and Australia, where households would need a year and 10 months. Combine healthy US household balance sheets and higher spending on recreation and it’s hard to conclude that, generally speaking, the US consumer is anything but healthy. A strong consumer means a strong economy and strong corporate earnings. That, in turn, translates to larger returns to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In 2023, S&P 500 firms spent over $800 billion buying back shares from investors, while giving them over $500 billion in cash dividends. You can be one of the people getting a “paycheck” from companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V) when you invest in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ). But don’t expect that to turn into a big cash flow overnight. With SPY yielding just 1.2%, even a million dollars in this fund won’t replace more than $1,000 per month in income—hardly a living wage! But we can speed that up without sacrificing quality if we instead buy a fund like the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), one of my favorite closed-end funds (CEFs). USA invests in US mid-cap and large-cap firms: Its portfolio holds Apple, Microsoft, Visa and many other top S&P 500 names. While its holdings resemble those of SPY, its dividend does not. USA turns gains and dividends from the stocks it holds into an income stream for investors, which is how it can pay out a far bigger dividend than SPY: 10%, to be exact. Based on USA’s yield (note that its payout does fluctuate a bit, based on the fund’s portfolio returns), a million-dollar portfolio now pays $8,333 averaged out on a monthly basis—higher than the average American’s paycheck. But will the income stream hold? A 10% yield seems unrealistically high, which is why a lot of people scoff when I show them facts like these. So let’s look at history. USA Dividend USA’s payout has steadily risen with the stock market over the last decade. As long as consumers have money to spend, giving companies revenue they can translate into profits for their shareholders, USA will be able to pump that dividend number up further. Finally, let’s talk about USA’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio). As I write this, the fund trades just a hair over par. While we prefer discounted CEFs, that’s reasonable for USA, given its strong management and outsized yield. We’ve also seen the fund trade at healthy premiums (north of 4%) as recently as July 2023. Nonetheless, if you prefer to buy at a discount, I get it. In that case, go ahead and put USA on your watch list. Given the fund’s very slight premium, it wouldn’t take much to push it back into discount territory. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Report: Donald Trump Puts Migration First in Final Days of 2024 Campaign
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/10/20/donald-trump-leads-with-migration-in-final-days-of-2024-campaign/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T13:09:14Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump is taking a political risk by centering migration — not the nation’s economy — in his two-week dash to the ballot box, says the New York Times. “In the final weeks of a campaign …. Mr. Trump is going with his gut, doubling down on the rhetoric that he believes won him the 2016 election and using immigration and the border to form the core of his closing message to voters,” the newspaper reported October 19. Migration ‘“beats out the economy” with voters, Donald Trump told his October 15 rally, the newspaper said. “It’s not even close.” Immigration and the economy are wrapped together, Trump’s campaign told the newspaper: Asked to explain Mr. Trump’s focus in the closing days of the race, a Trump spokesman, Brian Hughes, said: “President Trump rightfully recognizes that Kamala Harris’s porous border is at the heart of so many issues, whether it is high housing prices, low wages or overwhelmed hospitals and schools. An open border means that taxpayer dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants, instead of benefiting citizens. President Trump’s closing message is all about putting Americans first and restoring prosperity.” The Times reporters did not mention that Kamala Harris’ 2024 economic platform requires a huge inflow of migrants. A Democratic-leaning advocacy group, for example, predicted she will import 12.3 million migrants during the next four years. Amazingly, Harris has not tried to revive her campaign with a promise to reduce the inflow of economic migrants, despite her promising to upgrade border security many times. RELATED — CNN’s Zakaria: Biden Should Go Back to Trump’s Immigration Policies A growing number of GOP leaders — including Trump’s pick for Vice President, JD Vance — recognize that the federal migration policy imposes huge pocketbook and civic costs on ordinary Americans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), for example, wrote an October 17 article for CompactMag.com, showing that migration has damaged ordinary Americans: … immigration remained within sustainable limits through most of the 1970s and ’80s, and it remained within most Americans’ grasp to make ends meet. My own parents, themselves immigrants from Cuba, earned enough to buy a home and raise four children on the salaries of a hotel bartender and stay-at-home mom who occasionally worked as a maid. As recently as 1985, meanwhile, the average US-born man could afford a middle-class lifestyle for a family of four on about 40 weeks of wages (compared with about 62 weeks today). In other words, the American Dream was alive and well, for immigrants and natives alike. But Washington, DC, changed the rules for ordinary Americans by supercharging global trade and migration, Rubio wrote: The consequences of this for US-born men have been catastrophic. The percentage of prime-age men now working or looking for work is close to what it was in 1940, in the throes of the Great Depression. Meanwhile, one economist estimates that by 2016, immigrants had “increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent.” The Biden-Harris administration has only compounded the problem. By one government count, the administration has admitted at least 6.5 million more illegal migrants since then—and that doesn’t include an estimated 1.5 million “gotaways.” Some Wall Street investors are touting an alternative, low-migration strategy that would expand economic growth and prosperity. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme. Breitbart News has closely c0vered the federal government’s post-1990 use of migration to boost the U.S. consumer economy by extracting cheap workers, government-aided consumers, and apartment-sharing renters from poor countries. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages, subsidizing low-productivity companies, boosting rents, and spiking real estate prices. The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout, slowed high-tech innovation, shrunk trade, crippled civic solidarity, and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded, low-status Americans. Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom. The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants, including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama.

Investors seeking sustainable returns will need to look for companies with solid long-term growth potential. To this end, top Wall Street analysts, with their expertise, can help investors understand the key drivers that could support a company's long-term growth and pick stocks that are likely to deliver lucrative returns. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is cybersecurity company Fortinet (FTNT). The company aims to become a leader in the secure access service edge space. Fortinet leverages machine learning and AI technologies to offer cybersecurity solutions. Recently, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reaffirmed a buy rating on Fortinet stock and raised the price target to $90 from $75. The analyst stated that channel checks and discussions with industry participants indicate continued recovery in FTNT's business and healthy demand across the company's broad product portfolio. In fact, channel checks suggest that Fortinet's third-quarter revenue and billings will reach the top end of the company's outlook, with the possibility of a modest upside. Also, the analyst is confident about his Q4 revenue growth estimate of 12%, given "healthy closure rates and further pipeline building into a seasonally strong 4Q24." Eyal also noted that one of the key drivers supporting Fortinet's ongoing recovery is the solid traction in the company's operational technology products, backed by a long-term replacement cycle that will replace legacy OT systems. The analyst added that FTNT is also gaining from the adoption of AI-led networks and the company's growing focus on cloud security, which was bolstered by the recent acquisition of Lacework. Eyal ranks No. 12 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. (See Fortinet Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks) We move on to GitLab (GTLB), an AI-powered, cloud-based software company that helps organizations enhance developer productivity, improve operational efficiency, and reduce security and compliance risks. Following meetings with the company's management, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated a buy rating on GitLab stock with a price target of $62. The analyst noted that management is highly confident about capturing further opportunities in the $40 billion total addressable market. Currently, the two vendors, GitLab and Microsoft's GitHub, together account for just about 5% of the market share in the software development life cycle space. In particular, management expects the momentum for GitLab's Duo Pro product to pick up in 2025, fueled by the generative AI wave. The analyst also highlighted the company's optimism about the GitLab Dedicated offering, which is witnessing better-than-anticipated customer interest and driving higher average revenue per unit. Overall, Moskowitz remains "constructive on GTLB's ability to execute and grow at a high level over the medium-to-longer term, due in large part to multiple upside levers that include seat expansion, price increases, and upsell potential." Moskowitz ranks No. 321 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. (See GitLab's Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) Finally, let's look at semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA). The company has been seeing stellar revenue growth rates, driven by robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) in building artificial intelligence models and applications. Following an investor meeting with Nvidia's management, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock and raised the price target to $150 from $135. The analyst's optimism after the meeting reflects a "better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand." Hari noted Nvidia's confidence about the demand backdrop, given continued spending on accelerated computing and GPUs by data center operators amid the generative AI wave. Management also highlighted the prospects for its Blackwell platform. The analyst thinks that Blackwell's launch and ramp-up are not just near- and medium-term revenue growth drivers, but also key factors that will enhance Nvidia's competitive advantage. Hari increased his revenue estimates for fiscal 2025-2027 to reflect recent industry developments like increased cloud spending, solid order trends at the major AI server original equipment manufacturers like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and an improved chip-on-wafer-on-substrate shipment outlook. Hari ranks No. 32 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%.

Title: Data centers and Crypto: Adapting for the future

Transitioning to spine-leaf architecture ensures blockchain networks maintain reliability and security, surpassing traditional data center designs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. The steady Bitcoin trickle into the mainstream consciousness since 2009 mainnet launch had many cascading effects. First, it served as a revelatory vehicle by exemplifying the nature of money; why it should be outside of central banking, and why fixed supply is important for the valuation of money. Second, Bitcoin sparked an entire crypto industry, further making the case for decentralized financial services that eliminate gatekeepers in favor of smart contracts enforced by blockchain networks. As this $2.2 trillion sector develops, banks are further poised to lose their role as trusted intermediaries. Third, data center infrastructure is becoming more important than ever. Whether home-based or as large mining operations, crypto infrastructure needs reliable high-performance computing resources, storage capacity and memory alongside fast networking to maximally reduce blockchain latency. In fact, data centers are so critical that an entire knowledge field emerged to balance power requirements, cooling solutions, server density and crypto hosting location. When these factors come together, crypto needs to forge an indelible mark on the data center design itself. Let’s explore how. In the early days of the internet, broadband connection was rare. This necessitated local resources within businesses and institutions to be used for data storage and management. By the end of 2000s, broadband infrastructure had become sufficiently ubiquitous to start supporting cloud computing. In other words, data centers were being delocalized into remote, scalable, on-demand server clusters. The ability to eliminate on-premise infrastructure and host data and apps remotely drastically cut upfront capital expenditure. Of course, this ultimately benefited Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as the data center triumvirate that powers the bulk of today’s digital landscape. However, securing blockchain networks exerts an entirely new load layer. Because these digital ledgers facilitate real-time transaction processing, between multiple nodes to verify them, extra CPU, GPU power and RAM is needed to minimize congestion and latency. And if there is a sudden spike in blockchain network traffic, this too requires resource redundancy. This is why both AI and blockchain-oriented data centers have been transitioning from traditional client-to-server architecture (north to south) to spine-and leaf architecture (east to west). The spine-leaf approach makes for a non-hierarchical design that allows data to flow horizontally between servers. This is critical for blockchain networks, as each node directly communicates with other nodes without having to go through a congestible central point. Therefore, a spine-leaf architecture alleviates bottleneck and single point failure potential. Because this mirrors the spirit of crypto decentralization and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, spine-leaf data centers have become the new standard for blockchain reliability and security. As blockchain networks need greater compute power to validate transactions and execute smart contracts, so is there greater need for energy consumption. By 2022, blockchain networks have already carved a significant proportion of data center electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the data sector servicing the crypto industry globally consumed 460 TWh in 2022, which is forecasted to more than double by 2026. For comparison, France consumed 447 TWh annually in 2021. These trends clearly point to a reliable source of power, which is why Microsoft saw fit to make a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to restart Unit 1 nuclear reactor in 2028. In Europe, the European Commission even designated Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as “green” to balance decarbonisation efforts with increased electricity demand. But raw power capacity is only the beginning of scaling. To make crypto-oriented data centers more efficient, they are moving closer to power plants. This is best exemplified by Bitcoin. The primary cryptocurrency uses a proof-of-work algorithm to secure the network, effectively anchoring Bitcoin in the physical world of energy and hardware assets. This is what ultimately gives Bitcoin its value as decentralized money and global transfer of wealth. In essence, Bitcoin represents digital energy. But because power is lost over long distance electrical transmission, due to copper/aluminum resistance, it would be wasteful to erect crypto data centers just anywhere. Rather, they should be as close to power plants as possible to minimize transmission loss. Case in point, the New York state power plant bypasses state level network by directly plugging in thousands of servers. Likewise, Ward Roddam, mayor of Rockdale, Texas, recently made the case that Bitcoin mining can revitalize communities by investing to siphon excess energy and stabilize the electric grid with flexible load demand. “Riot Platforms is building a state-of-the-art facility in Corsicana, which will be one of Navarro County’s largest employers. The mine could bring $1.4 billion in taxable purchases and over $115 million in wages over the next decade.“ Another crypto mining company, TeraWulf, has been building its Nautilus Cryptomine adjacent to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, now in the hands of Talen Energy. This will be the first zero-carbon, nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility. With a 200 MW capacity, this would be the equivalent to ~160,000 US households’ energy consumption annually. In addition to spatial proximity to reduce transmission loss, data centers servicing blockchain networks need particular mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) requirements. As every PC owner knows, the source of such requirements at large scale comes from heat management. Continuous solving of cryptography puzzles requires great computing power which generates heat. For many years, air cooling has been the go-to solution to prolong hardware longevity and dissipate heat. Unfortunately, cooling also draws significant energy on top of computing itself. This is why there is a new trend to rely more on direct-to-chip liquid cooling (immersion cooling) which cuts down on power usage. ₿𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚: 33,000 new immersion-cooled #bitcoin mining computers connect online today. This 100 megawatt facility is now the largest electricity user in Sadersville, Georgia. pic.twitter.com/5TzqF9f3IT — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) February 13, 2024 But even so, these types of data centers need advanced HVAC control systems and capacity to handle thermal loads. Equally so, high-power-density clusters, at 20 – 40 kW per rack, require larger power transformers, backup systems and high-capacity power distribution units (PDUs). For example, Crypto Minotaur PDU can handle up to 92.4kW worth of power density. Lastly, to ensure continuous blockchain workloads, such data centers typically rely on backup redundancy via natural gas or diesel power generators coupled with automatic transfer switches (ATS). Those familiar with the inner workings of Bitcoin code know that its security is derived from the concept of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). In short, even if multiple network nodes fail, the consensus on the current state of the ledger is still achieved. In data center design, this means that blockchain miners have to account for redundancy tiers according to the Uptime Institute: Of course, as each tier increases redundancy, so does it increases the cost. Large companies with deep pockets can afford such scaling and then attract smaller businesses into their cloud computing ecosystems. Case in point, Microsoft Azure’s data center infrastructure is certified as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and NIST SP 800-53 for network security and reliability, which is the prerequisite to achieve Tier IV level of fault tolerance. However, such redundancy is not strictly necessary for Bitcoin needs, as other nodes around the globe can take up the slack. Bitcoin’s 10-minute block confirmation interval was intentionally picked by Satoshi Nakamoto to inject inherent redundancy in the network. Nonetheless, this may not apply to blockchain networks like Solana (SOL) or Avalanche (AVAX) with near-instant settlements that aim to supplant Visa-like money transfer systems. For activities like day trading, they would require maximum uptime provided by Tier IV data centers. To that end, Solana Foundation formed the Solana Server Program. Its flexible month-to-month contracts rely on data center providers like Edgevana. Ethereum and Avalanche typically use AWS, Google Cloud and Tencent Cloud for the bulk of their server needs. After the 4th Bitcoin halving in April, miners’ rewards were cut in half, from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. At the same time, Bitcoin network difficulty increased from 86.3886 T to present 88.4044 T. It is further estimated that the next Bitcoin difficulty adjustment will increase by 3.81% on October 9th. This translates to fewer payments for the same amount of computational exertion and energy consumption. Yet, this would exert a negative impact, to the point of bankruptcy, only if Bitcoin price were to fall under $40k, according to CoinShares’ report. Taking into account the spectrum of initial capital expenditures, this translates to different cost runways for different mining companies. Analyze the return on investment for crypto mining operations, particularly in light of recent reductions in Bitcoin mining rewards. Consider the potential for additional revenue streams, such as converting facilities for heat reuse. But with major selling pressures out of the way, in particular from the German government and Mt. Gox payments, it is more likely that BTC price will go up rather than drop. Historically, BTC price achieves a new all-time high within ~18 months following the halving event. Moreso, the USG’s uncontrollable spending is likely to further cement Bitcoin’s case for sound money as the dollar’s value continues to gradually erode. Lastly, Bitcoin mining efficiency continues to improve, as noted by aforementioned cooling immersion and upgrades to newer ASIC machines such as Antminer S21. For an electric grid to remain stable (and usable) it has to balance periods of high and low demand. The Bitcoin network is ideally suited for this task as Bitcoin miners can adjust usage on the fly. After Texas legislatures passed House Bill 591, Bitcoin data centers have a further role to play in energy sustainability. The bill allows oil and gas operators to sell vented/flared gas to on-site mobile data centers. This gas would otherwise be wasted as a byproduct of extraction. Such redirection is estimated to reduce their carbon footprint by up to 63%. On top of this, Bitcoin data centers using immersion cooling can use that energy to heat water. Using this approach Canadian crypto miner startup MintGreen has been deploying Digital Boilers in Vancouver. 500 kVA for in-house Digital Boiler testing ♨️🌱 pic.twitter.com/KMhlgbFbej — MintGreen (@MintGreenHQ) March 19, 2024 Excess data center heat could also be used to heat greenhouses, as showcased in the Netherlands by BloemBitcoin. 🌷 💨 pic.twitter.com/uEemmptSGg — BitcoinBloem (@BloemBitcoin) March 4, 2023 If Bitcoin price gains new high ground in 2025 and beyond, it is not difficult to see greater mainstream acceptance of such innovative solutions. Crypto mining first brought into focus large scale high-performance computing (HPC). For the longest time, this was met with hostility, often painted as wasteful. After BlackRock’s successful integration of Bitcoin via its IBIT ETF, such concerns have largely disappeared. Yes, this was the same BlackRock that pushed the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework in the finance sector. Crypto mining is now set to be overshadowed by generative AI infrastructure, benefiting from years of lessons learned in large scale data center deployment. Moreover, even crypto mining companies like Core Scientific and Iris Energy are adopting a hybrid approach by hosting both GPU servers for AI and ASIC machines for Bitcoin mining. In the end, crypto data centers have proven to be anything but wasteful.

Title: Ciarán Frawley’s availability for Ireland’s clash with All Blacks in doubt
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/20/ciaran-frawleys-availability-for-irelands-clash-with-all-blacks-in-doubt/

Full Content:
Leinster are expected to give an update on the injury which forced Ciarán Frawley in the 17th minute of their 33-12 win over Connacht in the Sportsground in their weekly Monday bulletin. The Ireland international limped off gingerly after being tackled by David Hawkshaw in the build-up to Leinster’s second try by Liam Turner when his foot was momentarily trapped under the Connacht centre. “I don’t know, is it his foot or ankle. I’m not 100 per cent sure yet,” admitted Leo Cullen. “The two new caps were taking centre stage in the dressingroom, so we’ll find out and will know more on Monday,” added the Leinster head coach in reference to their two debutants, 20-year-old hooker Stephen Smyth and 21-year-old centre Hugh Cooney. Frawley was replaced by Ross Byrne, who steered Leinster to their fifth bonus point in five games to lead the BKT URC table by seven points, 10 points clear of Ulster, a dozen ahead of Connacht and 14 clear of Munster after their error-strewn 34-19 loss to the Stormers in Cape Town. Frawley was unlikely to feature next Saturday at the Aviva Stadium against the Lions, who sit in second place with the only other unbeaten record and a game in hand on Leinster, when Sam Prendergast is likely to return. But after his match-winning drop goals in Ireland’s last outing against the Springboks in Durban, Frawley’s anticipated presence in the Irish matchday squad against New Zealand in their opening Autumn Nations Series game at the Aviva Stadium on Friday, November 8th must be in doubt. “We’re delighted with the win,” said Cullen on a blustery night in Galway, after Leinster stormed into a 21-5 lead by half-time with three first-half tries and completed another bonus point within six minutes of the restart. “It’s bloody tough coming here. Conditions were tricky as well out there. I thought we started the game well again, that’s a few weeks in a row we’ve started the game well. “We got in for two good tries and probably had another couple of opportunities we didn’t take. Connacht came back into the game and had to play into the wind, it was very difficult to kick into the wind. “They got in for a good try and you’re thinking, ‘this is probably not going to be a big enough lead’. We did well to score on half-time, which gives us a bit of scoreboard separation. “We started the second half well and got in, but Connacht were challenging us the whole time. Then they eventually got in for a good try, and it was going to be a tight 15 minutes, and then Ross kicks off and then Andrew Osborne gobbles the ball out of the air and scores an incredible try, which probably just took the sting out of Connacht a little bit. “Overall, we’re delighted, with five academy players in the 23, two guys making their debuts. There’s lots of positives in that.” It’s already becoming hard to credit that Gus McCarthy is still one of the those five academy players. The 21-year-old hooker, who captained Blackrock College to the Leinster Schools Senior Cup and the Ireland Under-20s to a Six Nations title and World Cup final two seasons ago, was making his third start of the season for Leinster in addition to Emerging Ireland’s win over Western Force, after which he was called home to play the second half of last week’s win over Munster in Croke Park. This was in light of Rónan Kelleher joining long-term casualty Dan Sheahan on the casualty list after an ankle procedure which will sideline him for the New Zealand game and beyond. With the Ulster pair of Rob Herring and Tom Stewart yet to feature this season, the in-form Dave Heffernan looks favourite to start against the All Blacks but although it’s probably too early for McCarthy, who caught the eye at the Dexcom Stadium with three clean breaks, he is nonetheless putting himself in the conversation. “Yeah, he’s been fantastic, Gus,” said Cullen. “He had lots of big moments in the game today. I talked about him last week, we were talking about the hookers, the three guys we had during pre-season. “Stephen [Smyth] was away with the 20s, so it’s good to see him come off the bench today and make his debut which is fantastic. He’s definitely one for the future as well. “With Gus, he was fighting it out with John [McKee] and Lee [Barron] over the course of pre-season and he did well. He got a start in that first game against Edinburgh, had a quick trip to South Africa and played two games while we played one, and straight into Croke Park last week. “It’s been a fantastic first five rounds, which has included a trip to South Africa, a brilliant experience for him.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Details Better Than The Headline This Earnings Season
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/20/details-better-than-the-headline-this-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T11:00:00Z

The blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter, but 79% ... [+] of S&P 500 firms have reported better-than-expected earnings this season. Within the S&P 500, 42 companies reported earnings last week. 79% of S&P 500 firms have reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The third-quarter earnings season enters its second busiest reporting week, with 112 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Among the companies scheduled include Coca-Cola (KO), Tesla (TSLA), Union Pacific (UNP), 3M (MMM), and Honeywell (HON). A more detailed preview of the earnings season is available here. S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose by 0.9% for the week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a gain of 0.7%. Interestingly, despite the S&P 500 setting a new all-time closing high on Friday, the Magnificent 7 remains about 5% below its July high. However, the Magnificent 7 still dominates the year-to-date performance. Stock Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical outperformed, the less economically exposed defensive stocks. The spike in cyclical outperformance followed the much better-than-expected monthly jobs report, which removed the short-term fear of recession. The outperformance of smaller-capitalization stocks is another sign that markets are becoming less concerned about the risk of recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The financials sector was the most significant contributor to earnings growth, led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Progressive (PGR), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS), according to FactSet. Conversely, the energy, healthcare, and industrials sectors have been the most significant detractors of S&P 500 earnings growth. Earnings estimates for energy companies, including Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), were cut, sending the energy sector estimates to -26.0% year-over-year after expecting a -19.1% at the start of the earnings season. Boeing (BA) announced much worse than expected preliminary results last week, which caused analysts to slash earnings estimates, sending the industrials sector estimates to -8.4% year-over-year versus 1.3% growth at the start of the earnings season. Boeing is scheduled to make its official earnings report on Wednesday. Healthcare sector earnings, expected to be a bright spot this quarter, have fallen to an expected 5.7% growth rate compared to 11.2% year-over-year at the end of the quarter. The primary culprit was Eli Lilly (LLY), which saw earnings estimates revised lower after an announcement that acquisition-related charges for in-process research and development (IPR&D) would lower profits by approximately $2.83 billion or $3.08 per share. 3Q 2024 Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. With nominal GDP growth likely solid year-over-year for the first quarter, topline revenue growth for companies should have a tailwind. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has matched expectations. 3Q 2024 Sales Growth By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +3.4% year-over-year, below the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Based on the better-than-expected consumer spending data last week, the Atlanta Fed estimates 3.4% 3Q GDP growth. The hurricanes and the threatened dock worker strike complicate the analysis of economic data since the more robust retail sales could have been driven by pulling forward demand, which will then be a headwind for upcoming consumer spending data. In any case, the economy remains resilient; it is just a matter of how strong the normalized growth is. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate The additional rate cuts expected in 2024 are two successive 25 basis point (0.25%) cuts in November and December. While the probability, based on the pricing of Fed Fund futures, remains high, they have fallen from even higher conviction levels as recent economic data has been robust. Federal Reserve Expected Rate Cuts The heart of earnings season kicks off this week with the laggard of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), reporting earnings. Even though the current estimated third-quarter earnings growth doesn’t reflect it yet, almost eighty percent of companies have outperformed earnings forecasts. Forward guidance remains critical, with less fear of an economic downturn and consensus estimates calling for double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and 2025.

The bitcoin price, which soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin in recent weeks thanks to BlackRock and China, has stalled after Tesla's $750 million worth of bitcoin moved to new addresses following two years of dormancy, sparking speculation Tesla may have sold off its remaining bitcoin. Now, as billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller issues a serious Federal Reserve warning, Elon Musk has repeated a warning that the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has repeatedly warned the U.S. is headed for "bankruptcy"—while the ... [+] bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin. "Excess government spending is driving America to bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter. Musk's post quoted an anonymous finance account that had said "$500 billion was added to the national debt in just the last 3 weeks," adding: "The government is out of control." Meanwhile, speaking during a town hall meeting in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Musk warned inflation could again spiral out of control as a result of "crazy" government spending. "The Federal government is spending America into bankruptcy ... and that's what really leads to inflation ... when the government spends more than it brings in," Musk said, calling it a "pernicious" tax. "We have to radically reduce the amount of government spending so we don't rack up a government debt that's impossible to repay and we don't drive the country to bankruptcy," Musk said. 10/20 update: Elon Musk has continued to warn that U.S. spending is spiraling out of control, posting to X that "this needs to stop." "The U.S. Treasury—your tax dollars—are being wasted at a staggering rate," Musk posted, quoting a post by a political action committee (PAC) founded by Musk that claimed "half a trillion dollars has been added to the National Debt in the past three weeks." "Wasteful spending is out of control in this country," the America PAC posted, adding "a Department of Government Efficiency is desperately needed." Musk has agreed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that has been suggested by former U.S. president and Republican candidate Donald Trump, calling it Doge—a reference to the meme that's also the basis of the dogecoin cryptocurrency. The dogecoin cryptocurrency, a tongue-in-cheek rival to bitcoin that's been semi-adopted by Musk over recent years, has seen its price soar 25% this last week on the back of Musk's Doge department comments—which caused billionaire Mark Cuban to joke that Musk could put "dogecoin in the U.S. Treasury," if Donald Trump retakes the White House next month. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024.

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by "persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar," according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade. "Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin," JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Sunday, 20 Oct 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The right to speak and the freedom of our people must be preserved and defended, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong. "I'm puzzled, why today the government seems to be trying to restrict the people's freedom of speech, when before it was proclaimed that 'the voice of the people is the voice of God'," the MCA president said. Addressing a gathering that also included Barisan Nasional chairman Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Dr Wee expressed concern over apparent attempts to restrict the people's freedom of expression. "In this hall (San Choon Hall), there are many whose videos have been taken down from social media, such as secretary-general Datuk Chong Sin Woon. "How many videos have been affected, deleted, removed?" he said at the 71st MCA annual general meeting held at Wisma MCA on Sunday (Oct 20). Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching had earlier stated that social media platforms independently remove content based on their assessments and user abuse reports, not just government requests via the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). While the Government Takedown Request Report indicates TikTok received 1,862 requests from the Malaysian government, it also highlights that there were 6,231 total requests for content removal. Muar MP Syed Saddiq claimed that the government sought the removal of TikTok videos uploaded by former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin. These videos addressed the privatisation of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) and mentioned American company BlackRock, which is purportedly linked to Israel. However, Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil later clarified that neither his ministry nor the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) were involved in the removal of these videos.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. MUMBAI : While parenthood is a very special feeling, it demands a lot of financial adjustments. However meticulously one plans, there are always surprises when one becomes a parent. Mint spoke to some young families to find out how they deal with the various costs associated with parenthood. The Google familyGoogle Llc employee Aman Narang and his wife Isha Aggarwal are parents to a 14-month-old son. While now in Gurugram, the couple was in Bengaluru during their son's birth. The couple had an interesting start to spending on baby care as their parents were based in North India (Delhi and Haryana). “Initially, for support, we used to fly down our parents to Bengaluru," Narang said. Credit card saves the dayCredit card points helped the family save money on these frequent and often last-minute flight bookings, as the couple didn’t have any close relatives in Bengaluru for support. “I used points on my Axis Magnus credit card to book 12-13 flight tickets during that initial period of five months. If not for the card, we would've spent close to ₹1 lakh on just getting our parents to fly down here. We shelled out just ₹15,000, charged as processing fees, on this unexpected expense," he said. “There were also some last-minute cancellations, but as these tickets were booked on points, a small point-based penalty was charged, but most of the points were credited back to the account," he added. Also Read: Diapers, doctors, schooling: know the costs of raising a child in India The domestic help cum nannyAfter their son turned five months old, the couple got external help. “We hired a domestic help cum nanny when we moved to Gurugram for a monthly salary of ₹20,000, who gives us 10-11 hours a day," Isha said. The couple moved to Gurugram to be close to their parents, Aman’s job offer and Isha's transfer to the company’s (BlackRock Inc.) head office. The baby car seatThe couple also tried to save by getting hand-me-downs from their friends and relatives. “I got a car seat from my sister-in-law as she is in the US and there it is mandatory to have a baby car seat. She gave most of the essentials that helped manage costs, e.g., booster seat, high chair, baby monitor, clothes, etc. We got a cot from another friend as a gift. Our families also ensured that they kept our preferences in mind while getting gifts for the baby because of which we could save a lot on essentials like a stroller, baby rocker, play gyms, developmental toys, etc.," Narang said. The couple follows an interesting practice when managing their household expenses. They have a separate joint bank account, which acts like their spending account. “Monthly spending for all non-savings items happens through this account," Narang said. The spending accountIn the run-up to the pregnancy, the couple had added a buffer to this spending account, expecting a higher outgo. “We added ₹15,000 every month into this account. However, this largely got used for the delivery costs, which exceeded the insurance cover, and the cord blood preservation, which was also quite expensive," he said. The employer benefitThe couple plans to put their son in daycare in the next few months. Here, Narang will benefit from his employer’s collaboration with daycare providers. “So, we should get discounts on the daycare costs," he said. The couple is planning a 5-6 hour daycare, which would otherwise cost ₹20,000 per month. However, the couple may need to pay only ₹5,000-6,000 per month. Also read: Opinion | Know the cost of raising a child to plan in advanceTotal first-year costThe couple’s monthly expenditure on clothes worked out to be ₹3,000, diapers ₹3,300, infant formula (5th to 11th month) ₹1,750 per month and nanny (from 5th month onwards) ₹20,000 per month, paediatrician visits ₹900 per month and vaccines ₹3,500 per two months during the first year. The couple spent a total of ₹3.17 lakh in the first year. Besides this, they celebrated their son's first birthday with a resort stay, costing ₹30,000 for the family. The traditional familyMumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added. Also Read: Children abroad? Why parents need a power of attorneyThe couple has also taken the membership of a toy library, which costs ₹600 per month. As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added. Also Read: What it costs to care for aged parents in India todayOverall costsOn average, the couple has spent ₹1,500 per month on baby clothes in the first year, ₹2,000 on baby formula, ₹3,500 on diapers, ₹8,000 per month on baby massage, etc. Overall, the couple has spent ₹2.34 lakh on the baby’s first year. The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. Google Llc employee Aman Narang and his wife Isha Aggarwal are parents to a 14-month-old son. While now in Gurugram, the couple was in Bengaluru during their son's birth.

The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding.

Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. Credit card points helped the family save money on these frequent and often last-minute flight bookings, as the couple didn’t have any close relatives in Bengaluru for support. “I used points on my Axis Magnus credit card to book 12-13 flight tickets during that initial period of five months. If not for the card, we would've spent close to ₹1 lakh on just getting our parents to fly down here. We shelled out just ₹15,000, charged as processing fees, on this unexpected expense," he said. “There were also some last-minute cancellations, but as these tickets were booked on points, a small point-based penalty was charged, but most of the points were credited back to the account," he added.

The couple moved to Gurugram to be close to their parents, Aman’s job offer and Isha's transfer to the company’s (BlackRock Inc.) head office. The baby car seatThe couple also tried to save by getting hand-me-downs from their friends and relatives. “I got a car seat from my sister-in-law as she is in the US and there it is mandatory to have a baby car seat. She gave most of the essentials that helped manage costs, e.g., booster seat, high chair, baby monitor, clothes, etc. We got a cot from another friend as a gift. Our families also ensured that they kept our preferences in mind while getting gifts for the baby because of which we could save a lot on essentials like a stroller, baby rocker, play gyms, developmental toys, etc.," Narang said. The couple follows an interesting practice when managing their household expenses. They have a separate joint bank account, which acts like their spending account. “Monthly spending for all non-savings items happens through this account," Narang said. The spending accountIn the run-up to the pregnancy, the couple had added a buffer to this spending account, expecting a higher outgo. “We added ₹15,000 every month into this account. However, this largely got used for the delivery costs, which exceeded the insurance cover, and the cord blood preservation, which was also quite expensive," he said. The employer benefitThe couple plans to put their son in daycare in the next few months. Here, Narang will benefit from his employer’s collaboration with daycare providers. “So, we should get discounts on the daycare costs," he said. The couple is planning a 5-6 hour daycare, which would otherwise cost ₹20,000 per month. However, the couple may need to pay only ₹5,000-6,000 per month. Also read: Opinion | Know the cost of raising a child to plan in advanceTotal first-year costThe couple’s monthly expenditure on clothes worked out to be ₹3,000, diapers ₹3,300, infant formula (5th to 11th month) ₹1,750 per month and nanny (from 5th month onwards) ₹20,000 per month, paediatrician visits ₹900 per month and vaccines ₹3,500 per two months during the first year. The couple spent a total of ₹3.17 lakh in the first year. Besides this, they celebrated their son's first birthday with a resort stay, costing ₹30,000 for the family. The traditional familyMumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added.

As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said.

But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding.

Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. In the run-up to the pregnancy, the couple had added a buffer to this spending account, expecting a higher outgo. “We added ₹15,000 every month into this account. However, this largely got used for the delivery costs, which exceeded the insurance cover, and the cord blood preservation, which was also quite expensive," he said. The employer benefitThe couple plans to put their son in daycare in the next few months. Here, Narang will benefit from his employer’s collaboration with daycare providers. “So, we should get discounts on the daycare costs," he said. The couple is planning a 5-6 hour daycare, which would otherwise cost ₹20,000 per month. However, the couple may need to pay only ₹5,000-6,000 per month.

The couple spent a total of ₹3.17 lakh in the first year. Besides this, they celebrated their son's first birthday with a resort stay, costing ₹30,000 for the family. The traditional familyMumbai-based Mayank Doshi, technology manager at Bank of America, and his wife Pankita, associate manager at Accenture, saved on costs by sticking to cloth diapers, getting their baby vaccinated at government centres, and thanks to gifting traditions in their family. The couple spent ₹2.29 lakh in their first year as parents to a 13-month-old baby girl. Pocket-friendlyDoshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added. Also Read: Children abroad? Why parents need a power of attorneyThe couple has also taken the membership of a toy library, which costs ₹600 per month. As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby. They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added.

They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost. Doshi said he had been lucky with costs. “My daughter breastfed for 10 months. Then, we gradually introduced her to normal buffalo milk. So, we never had to give her any formula," he said. The couple also used cloth diapers largely instead of disposable diapers. These also helped save on costs as cloth diapers can be reused. “We use regular diapers (not cloth) during the night to ensure she sleeps well. We also use them when we travel with the baby. We use regular diapers after the oil massage, as the baby is tired after the massage and needs good sleep," Pankita said. “The other advantage of cloth diapers is that it is said to be better against a baby’s skin," she added.

As far as vaccination is concerned, the family went to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) centres, where vaccines are given for free. To be sure, the couple went to a private hospital for a few vaccines, which were unavailable at BMC centres. “We have also been lucky as there is a tradition of gifting in our family and extended family. So, we received a lot of gifts for our baby like clothes, toys, baby cot, crib, sleeping cot, stroller, etc.," Doshi added. For the baby’s first-year birthday anniversary, the couple had a small family get-together at home, which cost ₹7,000. Work set-upBoth Doshi and Pankita work in hybrid mode. This flexibility allows the couple to look after the baby. Though the family has employed a nanny, the couple said they needed to keep a watch to ensure the baby’s routine was followed. The nanny is paid ₹15,000 per month for ten hours. “My mother is also at home, but having a nanny allows everyone else to follow their own routine," he said. The self-employed parentsFor Shravan Suratwala and Divya, a Pune-based self-employed couple, the expenses of raising a child started right from Day 1 as they didn’t have maternity insurance coverage from an employer like most salaried individuals. “We had a personal insurance cover, but the waiting time on the maternity benefit was much longer," Suratwala, a chartered accountant, said. The couple spent ₹1.3 lakh in delivery costs. Suratwala said that diligently maintaining a contingency fund helped deal with these costs. “I usually keep around ₹4-5 lakh in savings, roughly five months’ worth of expenses and investments. Before delivery, I ensured it was around ₹6.5 lakh," he added. Nanny troublesSuratwala said Divya, a company secretary, largely took care of the baby during the initial months. “As we are self-employed, there was no pressure to resume work in six months. So, she was able to be with the baby for longer. It was when my wife wanted to get back to routine, we tried to work with a nanny. Our son was nine months old when we first tried one," he said. The monthly cost of getting the nanny was ₹10,000 for eight hours daily (10am-6pm). However, the couple decided to do without a nanny after trying two in two months. “We were not happy with how the nannies handled our baby.

They were not open to following instructions; there was a lot of resistance to learning our ways. Also, they were not very reliable considering a proper schedule needs to be followed when a baby is around to ensure the baby’s feed timing and sleep timings don’t get disturbed," Divya said. “We decided that we need to put our son in daycare. So, when he turned one year old, we put him in daycare close to our house as it would help us get back to our routine and also help the kid be socially active and be around kids his age rather than being stuck with a nanny," he added. The couple pays ₹13,000 monthly for the daycare (10am to 6pm). The couple stays with Suratwala’s parents. However, both sets of grandparents are also pursuing their professions and businesses. In fact, Suratwala’s father is a practising chartered accountant, and the couple is working with him to expand the practice. Indirect costs of daycarePutting their son in daycare has led to some indirect healthcare costs. “We have seen our son falling sick many times after joining the daycare because kids quickly catch stuff from other kids. Nothing major, though," he said. Still, Suratwala added that they find daycare more convenient than keeping a nanny. “We get time to do our work, and the kid is not stuck with the nanny. Also, keeping just a nanny is not enough, as someone has to be around the nanny to monitor how the child is being cared for. So, the entire point of getting back to routine is defeated," he said. Second-hand baby stuffThe couple has tried to save costs where they can. “We found a platform that sold rarely-used strollers at 50% of the original cost. It’s unpredictable whether the baby will sit in the stroller and for how long. So, buying an expensive stroller did not make sense," he said. “We are also fortunate to be around people who have gifted us useful things. We got a travel stroller as a gift from our friends as we were planning an international trip with the baby," he added.

The first birthday party cost another ₹1 lakh. Needing a villageAs they say, you need a village to raise a child. Bengaluru-based Gunjan Vijayvargiya and Bharat Vijayvargiya had actually set up a village in their house after their baby boy’s delivery. “We had everyone at home initially: my mother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and her husband. So, we had a lot of support," Gunjan said. However, she said their household budget sky-rocketed during this period to about 2.5X. “But the family support ensured the transition was very smooth for me," she added. The search for a massage ladyWhile Gunjan doesn’t intend to keep a nanny, she has a massage lady. “Earlier, the massage lady charged us ₹3,000 per month for the baby's massage and bath. But after I went to visit my parents in Bhopal, she got other clients, and now she doesn’t have any free slots. So, she just comes to give a bath to the baby, and I do the oil massage. The lady charges us ₹1,500 per month for this," Gunjan said. She pointed out a supply-demand mismatch for massage ladies in her neighbourhood. “The massage lady we actually wanted charges ₹9,000 per month, but her slots are just unavailable," Gunjan added. Clothes and diapersGunjan said they are spending ₹5,000 on baby clothes per month. They aren't spending anything on baby formula right now, as their six-month-old baby is breastfeeding. Also Read: What parents of specially abled children must know about insurance, taxesTheir diaper costs are ₹2,000 per month. “A lot of clothes buying is impulse-driven as you always look for clothes that will look good on the baby," she added. Costly vaccinesVaccines have also been costly for the family. She said each dose so far has cost ₹9,100, with the pediatric consultation costing another ₹900 every time the vaccine is given. The doses are typically once every two months. She wants to avoid getting a nanny, as she is not comfortable with having one. "We hope my in-laws will stay with us till our son turns one year or year-and-a-half old. Then, we will see if we need to put him in daycare or playgroup," she said. Overall, if their current costs are annualized, the family is expecting to spend at least ₹2 lakh in the first year as parents. Indirect costsApart from the direct costs, the couple also spent ₹50,000 on their parents' flight tickets. When the baby turns one year old, the couple also plans to keep a small event, which would be an additional cost.

Title: Street calls of the week

Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! What happened? On Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to Underweight with a $332 price target. *TLDR: Morgan Stanley sees mounting pressures and potential de-stocking downturn for CAT’s Construction Industries. Analysts predict 2025 EPS 10% below consensus, suggesting negative risk-reward for CAT shares. What’s the full story? Morgan Stanley analysts see mounting pressures for Caterpillar’s Construction Industries segment. They have been cautious about US Non-Residential construction activity and CAT earnings throughout the year. Now, they observe rising evidence of a potential de-stocking downturn for US construction equipment. Factors such as optimistic expectations of non-residential growth driven by near-shoring, a normalizing supply chain, an increasingly competitive market, and deteriorating used equipment markets have led to bloated channel inventories that need to be de-stocked. As a result, the analysts foresee increased risk of downward earnings revisions for CAT, with their 2025 EPS estimate now 10% below consensus. Combined with CAT shares’ year-to-date outperformance and a valuation that places an above mid-cycle multiple on what they believe are closer to peak earnings, the analysts suggest a negative risk-reward scenario. Underweight at Morgan Stanley means “The stock's total return is expected to be below the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.” What happened? On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) to Sell with a $45 price target. *TLDR: Goldman Sachs issues Sell rating for Etsy due to persistent GMS declines and low growth visibility. Analysts foresee further negative revisions and unfavorable risk/reward despite Etsy’s YTD underperformance. What’s the full story? Goldman Sachs has issued a Sell rating for Etsy, citing three main concerns. Firstly, the bank notes that Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) declines have persisted longer than expected, with low visibility on a return to positive growth, contrary to the Street’s 2025 GMS forecast of +3% year-over-year. Secondly, Goldman Sachs expects Etsy to continue losing market share in global eCommerce (excluding China) due to muted active buyer growth and an increasingly competitive market. Lastly, the bank warns that Street Adjusted EBITDA estimates could be revised lower if GMS declines persist or if Etsy increases growth investments, which would reduce valuation support for the shares. Despite Etsy’s 39% year-to-date stock underperformance, Goldman Sachs sees an unfavorable risk/reward scenario due to the potential for further negative revisions to medium-term consensus estimates. Sell at Goldman Sachs means “Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage universe.” What happened? On Wednesday, HSBC downgraded Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) to Hold with a $100 price target. *TLDR: EL’s restructuring affects staff morale and risks losing quality managers. Internal candidates likely to replace CEO Freda; future management should influence restructuring. What’s the full story? HSBC is not expecting the shake-up it believes is necessary. As the restructuring progresses, it comes with collateral damage, affecting staff morale and potentially leading to the loss of quality managers who may find it difficult to trust their career paths within the firm. HSBC now views the implementation of the cost-cutting program as an indication that the replacement of CEO Freda will likely be an internal candidate. Given the length of non-compete clauses in the sector, if an external candidate had been secured, the market would have likely heard about it by now. Future management should have a say in what is cut and what is enhanced. Stéphane de la Faverie, executive group president, and Jane Lauder, executive VP of enterprise marketing and chief data officer, are leading the restructuring program together. It would be logical for the group to be led by one or both of them. However, despite their qualities, they are partly responsible for the group’s track record and might find it challenging to implement the type of reset or cultural change that HSBC feels is needed. Hold at HSBC means “… the stock may be classified as a Buy or a Hold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between 5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce…” What happened? On Thursday, B.. Riley upgraded Alcoa (NYSE:AA) to Buy with a $50 price target *TLDR: Alcoa’s Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $455M beat estimates; B. Riley upgrades to Buy. B. Riley raises 2025 EBITDA estimate to $2.4B, citing strong cash flow and alumina prices. What’s the full story? On Wednesday Alcoa reported a third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $455 million, surpassing B. Riley’s estimate of $383 million and the FactSet consensus of $386 million. The brokerage attributed this beat primarily to lower-than-expected intersegment eliminations. As a result, B. Riley has upgraded Alcoa from Neutral to Buy, citing the company’s successful execution of profitability savings programs, the full realization of higher alumina prices, and an increased likelihood of debt paydown, which could ultimately lead to higher shareholder returns. Despite concerns about the sustainability of current alumina prices in the long term, B. Riley believes that Alcoa’s cash flow generation in the medium term will remain robust, bolstered by the timely acquisition of Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Limited. The brokerage has revised its 2025 adjusted EBITDA estimate from $1,764 million to $2,412 million, translating to a 2025 FCFE of $983 million, or a 9% yield. Additionally, B. Riley has adjusted its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA estimate from $413 million to $563 million. Buy at B. Riley means “We generally expect “Buy” rated stocks to have an above-average risk-adjusted total return over the next 12 months. We recommend that investors buy the securities at the current valuation. “ What happened? On Friday, UBS upgraded Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to Buy with a $150 price target. *TLDR: UBS upgrades Datadog to Buy, citing improved spending and strong cloud growth prospects. UBS expects Datadog’s revenue growth to reach 25-30% in 2025-2026, despite premium valuation. What’s the full story? UBS has upgraded Datadog shares to a Buy from a Neutral, following the latest industry checks that indicate potential improvements in second-half spending and strong medium-term growth prospects for the AWS/Azure cloud infrastructure sector. The analysts believe these trends could help Datadog maintain or even modestly accelerate its mid-20% growth rate in the coming quarters. Despite Datadog shares trading at a premium—10 times the estimated 2026 revenues and 34 times the estimated 2026 free cash flow—UBS sees potential upside. This optimism is based on the expectation that revenue growth estimates for 2025 and 2026 could increase to the 25-30% range, up from the current 25-26%, with UBS estimates being approximately 200 basis points higher than consensus. Buy at UBS means “FSR is > 6% above the MRA” where FSR means Forecast Stock Return.

Title: ‘We’re fully booked’: How grind schools became big business

Yvonne O’Toole, principal of the Institute of Education, is standing outside the school’s entrance on Dublin’s Leeson Street as hordes of students pour outside on their lunch break. She’s beaming – and with good reason. The private grinds college, where full-time students pay annual fees of up to €11,000 a year, has enrolled a record 1,650 students this year. There is a long waiting list to gain entry to sixth year, while thousands more students are due to attend its revision courses over the coming months. “We’re officially the largest school in Ireland,” says O’Toole. “I’m very proud of the school, but I’m actually very proud of that fact.” Business is booming in Ireland’s grinds industry, which is estimated to be worth anywhere between €30-40 million a year. The institute, founded more than 50 years ago, was sold to UK-based schools group Dukes Education last year for just under €135 million. Its main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It has about 340 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students and is due to expand next year when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock. The online grinds business is also heating up. A newcomer on the scene is Grinds360, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. The service promises “cutting-edge AI technology” and some of Ireland’s best teachers with a track record of delivering “exceptional student results” for up to 19 subjects for a cost of €999 a year. There are dozens of other online competitors such as Studyclix (up to €75 a year), as well as private grinds offered by individual teachers in almost every town and village across the country (sometimes the same teachers who teach children in class) typically for €50 an hour. There is a growing grinds culture in Ireland, far in excess of many other European countries. Almost 60 per cent of Leaving Cert students are estimated to be availing of grinds, up from below 50 per cent a decade ago, according to a 2022 ESRI study. They are most common among children of well-off professional or managerial parents hoping to give their sons and daughters an edge in the CAO points race. The study’s authors, Prof Selina McCoy and Prof Delma Byrne, found that the grinds culture had become normalised, stemming from the high-stakes nature of the Leaving Cert. They said they were now “an accepted component of examination success for many students”. Since Covid, in particular, many grind schools say demand has “exploded” due to a combination of grade inflation, higher CAO points and a sense that competition for top college courses has grown even fiercer. “It just skyrocketed over the last few years and got crazy with demand for grinds ,” says Rónán Murdock, a former grinds teacher who is now chief executive of Grinds360. The sector has no shortage of critics. The education establishment tends to depict grind schools as military training grounds where students are drilled to produce perfect answers to potential questions based on marking schemes. Others argue that students who leave their regular school to attend full-time grinds lose their social ties with friends and are deprived of a rounded education with access to sport, extracurricular activities and pastoral supports. Campaigners, such as Prof Kathleen Lynch, argue more broadly that grinds contribute to inequality by allowing the most affluent to give their children an advantage to dominate entry to the most elite higher education courses. Naturally, grind schools see things very differently. At the Dublin Academy of Education, the bright classrooms with multicoloured furniture are full to capacity. “We’re an academic school rather than a holistic school,” says Ciarán Hartigan, the school principal. “Our primary focus is on the academics rather than trying to shape the individual as a whole.” Contrary to public perception, he says grind schools are not about cramming, rote learning or teaching to the test, he says. “The idea that a student could just learn off a number of essays and regurgitate them blindly in the exam and get full marks? That day is gone. It hasn’t worked since the ‘90s, and I’m not sure how well it ever worked.” The focus, he says, is on developing an understanding a subject through “great teaching”, as well as how to succeed in the exam. Over at the Institute of Education, O’Toole also says the traditional depiction of a grind school is misplaced. She says her “independent school” now offers sports, extracurricular activities such as debating and robotics, while there is big focus on guidance and wellbeing. It is, however, unashamedly academic in focus. “It’s important to say, this school isn’t for everybody,” O’Toole says. “We interview students coming in here and ask: ‘Is this school right for you?’ You have to be hardworking. You don’t have to be 600 points. You might be heading for 450 – great – but you have to want to work. It’s about that passion of wanting to work.” The school’s intake, she says, includes students from right across the city and wider commuter belt. “Most of our parents struggle to pay the fees. Many of them take out a loan to pay the fees,” she says. “They value education and many of them have saved for many years to send their students to us.” The growth of the grinds industry means there is fierce competition for the best teachers. Those who are textbook authors or State exam markers are in high demand. In some cases, the most highly regarded educators are on hefty six-figure salaries. At Grinds360, Murdock says his service has hired 15 teachers, 11 on a full-time basis. While top teachers can earn considerable sums, he says they are made to work for it. “I was one of those grinds teachers paid a really high salary, but you work incredibly hard; you can be working six days a week, giving up your evenings all the time,” he says. “Yes, the money can be brilliant but the volume of work is huge. If you’re a brilliant economics teacher, you might have 200 students and then 200 projects. A student might send your four or five emails on that project, and suddenly that’s 1,000 emails. You’re looked after, but your workload increases massively.” The popularity of grinds, however, is beginning to raise uncomfortable questions around the quality of teaching in regular schools. Teacher shortages in key subject areas mean many students have either reduced subject choice or may be taught by an unqualified or “out of field” teacher. Parents often are unaware, given that principals fear reputational damage if they highlight these difficulties. Some schools, especially in the south Dublin area, have been losing significant numbers of students to grind schools as a result. Another attraction, say some grind school operators, is the older age profile of students who want more independence and fewer rules. Hartigan, principal of the Dublin Academy, says they offer a “college-lite” atmosphere: there is no uniform, no bell for classes and no parent-teacher meetings. Mobile phones are allowed in common areas, but not in classes or the study hall. “My own experience personally in traditional schools was that with senior students ... they’ve almost outgrown a particular education environment or set of rules which are imposed on them,” he says. For all the cost of grinds, however, the extent to which they boost students’ performance is uncertain. The most recent ESRI study on this area found that private tuition appeared to pay off only for students with lower levels of achievement, with little if any gain for their middle and higher achieving peers. It does raise the question: is this a sector simply feeding into students’ – and parents’ – insecurities about the Leaving Cert? Murdock of Grinds360 says, if anything, they are easing students’ anxieties; additional tuition complements, rather than supplants, what a student learns in their regular school. “They give another perspective to students which can bolster their answers,” he says. “Students are working very hard and there is a lot of pressure to get the course done and pressure on points ... with online videos, they don’t have to worry about missing parts of the course. If anything, this is reducing stress.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Mastercard Incorporated (MA): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds. Wall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead. The broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November. However, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth. She noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month: This Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in. Earlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value. Adam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast. With that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142 Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American payment card services company headquartered in Purchase, New York. It provides financial services to individual consumers, merchants, small and large businesses, and governments by facilitating electronic funds transfers. During the second quarter, the company delivered strong results with net revenues growing 13% to $6.96 billion. Adjusted net income stood at $3.3 billion, expanding 24% from last year, resulting in an EPS of $3.59 which comfortably beat estimates of $3.51 per share. CEO, Michael Miebach, credited the strong performance to healthy consumer spending and cross-border volume growth. Miebach said that the decline in inflation rates, wage growth, and a solid labor market drove increased consumer spending during the quarter. While price levels are still elevated for various key essentials, many central banks have started to ease their policies amid a reduction in interest rates. Cross-border volume climbed 17% which was attributed to an increase in travel demand. According to the United Nations, international tourism is on track to reach pre-pandemic levels this year, which bodes well for Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)’s future outlook. The company also signed several new travel partnerships in Q2. These included a co-brand agreement with Ethiopian Airlines, the largest airline in Africa, and multi-year contracts with Expedia and Wells Fargo to launch two new co-brand cards with a range of unique travel benefits. Switched transactions on Mastercard’s network increased 11% year-over-year in Q2, compared to 12% in Q1, reflecting some deceleration in growth. Despite that, consumer spending remains on solid ground and is on track for growth as international travel continues to rise. As a result, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and have a consensus on its Buy rating. Hedge fund sentiment also remains strong. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, 142 hedge funds had investments in Mastercard, making it one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. Overall MA ranks 10th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wall Street Giant Morgan Stanley Bets Big On Bitcoin ETF: $272 Million Revealed

Last January 10th, 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved the Bitcoin ETF applications of 11 funds, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Blackrock’s IBIT. Within a month, trading volume increased as more banks, funds, and individual traders got a share. One market participant that’s slowly boosting its holdings is Morgan Stanley. In its recent 13F-HR/A filing with the SEC, Morgan Stanley declared $272 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs at the end of the third quarter. Although this seems like a sizeable investment, it only accounts for 2% of the total assets in management, now valued at $1.3 trillion. Massive news! 🚨 Morgan Stanley, a $1.3 trillion asset manager, just disclosed $272 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings. This is a clear sign that institutional adoption is accelerating. As more major players like Morgan Stanley continue buying into Bitcoin, it’s creating… https://t.co/bkCt59bSrD — Jimie (@Your_NLP_Coach) October 18, 2024 Morgan Stanley keeps its holdings in different baskets like a seasoned trader and investor. Many of its holdings are with Blackrock’s iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Management reported that it now owns 5.5 million shares of the BTC ETF, which it bought in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley’s holdings with Blackrock were worth $187.7 million at the time of the transaction but are now worth $209 million, or an increase of 10.2%. The company also shared that it holds a sizable holding with Ark 21 Shares but has reduced its holdings with Grayscale. Initially, Morgan Stanley boasted holdings worth $270 million, but they’re now down to $148,000. Morgan Stanley is one of the top asset managers with a Bitcoin and crypto-friendly strategy. Although the company was late in investing in Bitcoin ETFs, it still managed to build one of the most significant holdings in the United States. In August 2024, the company gave the go-signal to its managers to offer Bitcoin ETFs as an option for its wealthy customers. Considering its huge asset base, this was a significant move for the company. For example, if its manager allocates just 1% of the company’s assets to Bitcoin ETFs, it will create an inflow of $130 billion. The SEC’s approval of spot ETFs was a game-changer for the industry. According to analyst Kripto Mevsimi, Bitcoin is now a more mature asset and is starting to become an integral part of the financial market. The market continues to support Bitcoin ETFs, with impressive net flows in the last four days. Funds bought over $470 million worth of BTC yesterday, an improvement from Wednesday’s inflow. Again, IBIT leads the game with an inflow of $309 million. Also, ARKB notched an impressive day with a $100.2 million inflow. GBTC was also positive, getting $45.7 million yesterday.

Title: Bitcoin Poised To Reshape Global Finance And Public Markets

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Bitcoin has achieved a 1.3 trillion dollar market cap and boasts hundreds of millions of users, but it is still met by some with skepticism, fear, and even disdain. Detractors label it a tool for criminals or speculative gamble with no real future in the global financial system. Even today, remnants of that narrative persist among those who serve as a mouthpiece for big banks and deny its transformative potential. However, over the past 15 years, bitcoin has transitioned from being primarily a grassroots movement among individuals to gaining rapid adoption within institutional finance. Bitcoin's early detractors were not unjustified. In its initial stages, the project could well have failed. However, now that it has demonstrated its staying power, major financial institutions, hedge funds, and even sovereign entities have begun to explore bitcoin as a store of value. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has recently positioned himself as a prominent advocate. Once a skeptic, Fink now believes bitcoin is on the path to becoming a standalone asset class, comparable to other financial innovations that began slowly and later scaled, such as the mortgage and high-yield bond markets. He dismisses the notion that Bbitcoin’s trajectory depends on political outcomes, stating that neither U.S. presidential candidate will significantly alter its growth. This bullish stance is underscored by the success of BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF, which launched in January 2024 and has already amassed over $23 billion in assets. The record-breaking inflows into bitcoin ETFs signal a growing institutional appetite, outpacing even gold-based products in terms of capital inflows. In just ten months, bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $20 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which have only drawn $1.4 billion despite reaching record highs 30 times this year. This divergence highlights bitcoin’s growing recognition as a store of value and hedge against economic instability. As Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, regardless of U.S. election outcomes, it is clear that institutional money is increasingly flowing into Bitcoin, solidifying its role as a financial powerhouse in the global investment landscape. A pivotal moment in this shift occurred when publicly traded companies began accumulating bitcoin on their balance sheets not merely as an investment but as part of a broader treasury strategy. MicroStrategy in particular has become a key player in this trend, demonstrating how bitcoin can serve as a strategic asset in the unusual time period in which we live – when an entirely new form of base money is coming into existence. In 2020, MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, made headlines when the company announced it had converted its cash reserves into bitcoin, citing the long-term devaluation of fiat currencies and the need for a harder asset to preserve wealth. This decision was not just an isolated bet on bitcoin's future value but part of a larger strategy to capitalize on the unique properties of bitcoin as both a store of value and a strategic financial asset. Unpacking MicroStrategy’s bitcoin initiative, which is now colloquially called the “MicroStrategy playbook” and is being copied by other companies such as Metaplanet, will help illustrate why bitcoin is set to disrupt corporate finance. At the core of MicroStrategy’s approach is the use of convertible debt to fund the purchase of bitcoin on an ongoing basis. By issuing convertible notes at low interest rates and using the proceeds to buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has effectively become long on “global carry” – borrowing at low interest rates while investing in an asset that has the potential to appreciate significantly over time. At the same time, holding bitcoin itself positions the company short on global carry because bitcoin is inherently deflationary – its supply remains predictable as global liquidity increases, leaving only its price to respond to increasing demand. This dual position – being long and short on global carry simultaneously – is unique. It turns MicroStrategy into what could be described as a modern version of a 60/40 portfolio, with the key difference being that both positions (long and short) are embedded within the same asset. Saylor has created a scenario where MicroStrategy is capitalizing on both global liquidity and bitcoin’s scarcity to create what some have dubbed an infinite money glitch. It's a remarkable demonstration of financial engineering that could only happen in these early days of bitcoin’s monetization. For decades, the 60/40 portfolio – a mix of 60% equities and 40% bonds – was the gold standard for conservative investors. The theory behind it was simple: equities would provide growth, while bonds would provide stability and income, balancing risk and reward. However, in an economic environment marked by low interest rates and rampant money printing, this traditional model does not work as well as it used to. Bonds are now risky, and the performance of the stock market is tied to a tiny handful of companies that are monopolistic and highly regulated. The outsized performance of a select few companies – the so-called "Magnificent Seven" – has skewed overall market returns, masking weaker performances elsewhere. By mid-2024, this group, including giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, delivered an average return of 57% over the previous year, more than double the 25% return of the broader S&P 500. Without these seven mega-cap stocks, which now make up 31% of the S&P 500 by weight, the index’s returns would have been significantly weaker. In fact, if they were excluded, the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 18.1% as of July 2024 would be reduced to just 9%. This disparity illustrates how concentrated market performance has become. The decision by companies like MicroStrategy to adopt bitcoin is not simply a bet on price appreciation; it represents a fundamental shift in how businesses view treasury management in an increasingly unstable economic landscape. For decades, corporations have relied on cash reserves, bonds, and other fiat-based assets to manage their balance sheets. However, as central banks and regulators around the world now constantly intervene in the economy to achieve political ends, these traditional assets are losing their ability to preserve value. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers a flexible, low-maintenance store of value that has virtually no maintenance costs, and is immune to inflationary devaluation. Moreover, as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, its liquidity and market infrastructure continue to improve, making it easier for institutions to buy, sell, and hold large quantities without disrupting the market. MicroStrategy’s move to adopt bitcoin as a core treasury asset highlights the growing realization that bitcoin’s potential is far greater than many initially believed. The company’s innovative approach to leveraging both global liquidity and Bitcoin’s scarcity has not only outperformed traditional financial strategies but also demonstrated how Bitcoin can provide a strategic advantage in an inflationary fiat environment. At the time of writing, bitcoin’s market capitalization hovers around $1.3 trillion, roughly a tenth of gold’s $13 trillion. While bitcoin has already proven itself as one of the best-performing assets of the past decade, the potential for future growth is enormous. If bitcoin continues to be adopted by institutions, governments, and corporations, it could easily rival or surpass gold’s market cap, and even one day become a $100 trillion asset class. MicroStrategy’s bold moves are just the beginning of what could be a massive shift in corporate finance. If more companies recognize this unique moment for what it is, they too could take advantage of MicroStrategy’s infinite money glitch. It now appears that the next wave of bitcoin adoption will come by way of corporate balance sheets, marking the beginning of a new chapter in this fascinating story. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Promising Tech Stock Right Now

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other promising tech stocks. Big tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies. Wald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names. Given the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle. Technology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks. Ethridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it. He adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon. Now that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that ranks 10th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection. The company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government, reflecting its strong position in the market. Its AI native cybersecurity platform, Falcon is its primary product, growing at 80% year-over-year, in FQ2 2025. Despite the July 19 incident, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. In the past 40 days, the company closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions. On August 29, Eric Heath, KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his stance on CRWD. He suggested that despite its global outage in July, the long-term opportunity CRWD offers remains intact. He also added that the company is taking corrective action to avoid such incidents in the future and suggested the company has grown since the incident and will continue to do so. As our reliance on software increases so does the need for cybersecurity, which makes CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) an important stakeholder now and in the coming years. That said, according to our Insider Monkey database, 69 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024. Overall CRWD ranks 10th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Stock With the Lowest Short Interest to Buy?

Time Published: 2024-10-19T23:49:02Z
Full Content:
We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks with lowest short interest to buy. A report from S3 Partners revealed that the rally in Chinese stocks as a result of stimulus measures cost traders who were betting against the US-listed shares ~$6.9 billion in mark-to-market losses. Benchmark CSI 300 index saw an increase of more than ~22% over the past month. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon index went up by over ~34% during the same period. Much of these increases were seen off the back of policy-easing measures. S3 Partners went on to say that, before this market rally, short sellers continued to build their positions profitably in the falling market. However, after the rebound, the short selling in the group slowed. Before China announced the stimulus plans, shorting the Chinese stocks was a popular strategy, with several market players going underweight in the sector. S3 Partners reported that short interest in the US/Canada markets went up by $57.9 billion, or 5.1%, to $1.20 trillion in Q2 2024. The increase comprised $73.9 billion of new short selling, which was partially offset by a $16.0 billion fall in the mark-to-market value of shares shorted. During the quarter, the sectors that saw the largest increase in short selling were the IT, Industrials, and Communication Services sectors. On the other hand, the Energy sector was the only sector that saw a decrease in shares shorted (short covering). S&P Global reported that short sellers decided to pull back their bets against consumer staples stocks on the US exchanges during the summer months. This comes amidst the general increase in overall short interest throughout equities. Recent data suggests that the short interest in the consumer staples sector declined to 3.87% at the end of August from 4.16% at the end of May. The decline in short interest against consumer staples stocks might be due to the decline in inflation. On the other hand, short interest in the industrial sector went up by 21 bps from the end of May to the end of August, rose 20 basis points in the healthcare sector, and jumped 19 basis points in the real estate sector, as per the company. With the expectations of further rate cuts, market experts opine that the consumer staples sector might see sustained demand. The consumer spending resulted in solid Q2 2024 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% (annualized), approximately double the rate of Q1 growth, as per the US Bank. After the rate cut in September, market strategists recommended going long on consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. This is because these sectors are expected to receive a boost as declining mortgage rates might benefit spending, reported Reuters. Therefore, with the expectations of lower inflation and interest rates, there can be some revival in consumer confidence. This should result in increased spending on staple goods, which might lead to improved performance in the consumer staple sector. As per Evercore, among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples and consumer discretionary have seen the best average performance, with both sectors gaining ~14% a year after the rate cut.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Stock With the Lowest Short Interest to Buy?

We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks with lowest short interest to buy. A report from S3 Partners revealed that the rally in Chinese stocks as a result of stimulus measures cost traders who were betting against the US-listed shares ~$6.9 billion in mark-to-market losses. Benchmark CSI 300 index saw an increase of more than ~22% over the past month. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon index went up by over ~34% during the same period. Much of these increases were seen off the back of policy-easing measures. S3 Partners went on to say that, before this market rally, short sellers continued to build their positions profitably in the falling market. However, after the rebound, the short selling in the group slowed. Before China announced the stimulus plans, shorting the Chinese stocks was a popular strategy, with several market players going underweight in the sector. S3 Partners reported that short interest in the US/Canada markets went up by $57.9 billion, or 5.1%, to $1.20 trillion in Q2 2024. The increase comprised $73.9 billion of new short selling, which was partially offset by a $16.0 billion fall in the mark-to-market value of shares shorted. During the quarter, the sectors that saw the largest increase in short selling were the IT, Industrials, and Communication Services sectors. On the other hand, the Energy sector was the only sector that saw a decrease in shares shorted (short covering). S&P Global reported that short sellers decided to pull back their bets against consumer staples stocks on the US exchanges during the summer months. This comes amidst the general increase in overall short interest throughout equities. Recent data suggests that the short interest in the consumer staples sector declined to 3.87% at the end of August from 4.16% at the end of May. The decline in short interest against consumer staples stocks might be due to the decline in inflation. On the other hand, short interest in the industrial sector went up by 21 bps from the end of May to the end of August, rose 20 basis points in the healthcare sector, and jumped 19 basis points in the real estate sector, as per the company. With the expectations of further rate cuts, market experts opine that the consumer staples sector might see sustained demand. The consumer spending resulted in solid Q2 2024 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% (annualized), approximately double the rate of Q1 growth, as per the US Bank. After the rate cut in September, market strategists recommended going long on consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. This is because these sectors are expected to receive a boost as declining mortgage rates might benefit spending, reported Reuters. Therefore, with the expectations of lower inflation and interest rates, there can be some revival in consumer confidence. This should result in increased spending on staple goods, which might lead to improved performance in the consumer staple sector. As per Evercore, among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples and consumer discretionary have seen the best average performance, with both sectors gaining ~14% a year after the rate cut.

Title: $33.14 Billion At Risk If The Bitcoin Price Hits $72,462, Here’s Why

Time Published: 2024-10-19T23:00:19Z

Crypto analyst Ash Crypto has alerted the crypto community that $33.14 billion is at risk if the Bitcoin price reaches $72,462. This relates to the short positions that could be liquidated if the flagship crypto hits that price target, a development that will be bullish for BTC. Ash Crypto mentioned the liquidation alert in an X post, revealing that $33.14 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price hits $72,462. These BTC bears are already in danger of getting liquidated, considering that the flagship crypto is fast approaching the $70,000 price level. This could pave the way for an extended rally to this liquidation price and even beyond. The liquidations of these Bitcoin shorts could be bullish for the flagship crypto, leading to an extended rally to new highs, especially with the current ATH of $73,00 being in sight once the price hits $72,462. However, there is also a scenario where the Bitcoin price could correct to flush out overleveraged longs before it continues with its move to the upside. For now, the Bitcoin price undoubtedly boasts a bullish outlook, considering how the flagship crypto has rallied since the start of this week. BTC briefly touched $69,000 on October 18, further providing optimism that the crypto could reach a new ATH soon enough. Standard Chartered recently predicted that it will likely happen before the November 5 US elections. Although that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s demand is again on the rise, which could fuel this rally to a new ATH. Specifically, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which fueled the run to a new ATH earlier in the year, are again actively accumulating. SpotOnChain data shows that these Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $2.13 billion this week. BlackRock, in particular, added $1.14 billion worth of BTC to its holdings. Analyst Justin Bennett, known for bearish analysis, has warned traders to be cautious about trading amid this recent Bitcoin price rally. He stated that things do not add up and that staying cautious during periods like this is the best way to survive. He added that he won’t be making any bold predictions at the moment because the data is conflicting. However, he suggested that market participants shouldn’t be excited about Bitcoin’s breakout from the seven-month range. This followed his statement that the rally was primarily perp-driven and that open interest is back at its late July peak. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, who has been a Bitcoin bear lately, also warned that the Bitcoin price rally is being driven by the perpetuals market. In a recent X post, he noted that open interest has officially surpassed the level it was at before the last BTC drop from $70,000 to $49,000.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-southwest-airlines-co-214300865.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T21:43:00Z

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior manager studying a market index alongside a team of young stock market analysts. Consensus ROE: 49% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 23 Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is one of the biggest airlines in America with 817 aircraft in its fleet. Compared to the S&P’s airline index, which is up by 21% year to date, its stock has gained just 7.15%. This has been because of Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)’s massive 16% share price drop in March, which stemmed from the current turmoil facing the airline industry due to Boeing’s production woes. Back then, it was estimated that Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) would receive 46 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes compared to the earlier estimate of 58 planes. This ‘turbulence’ has shifted the narrative around the airline, with activist investor Elliot Management also disclosing a stake in it in June. Now, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) aims to increase the revenue that it can earn from existing passengers and run redeye flights that target underserved time slots. Consequently, its success in these initiatives will drive the stock’s performance. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV)’s management commented on these initiatives during the Q2 2024 earnings call: “Our research shows that 80% of our customers prefer an assigned seat, and 86% of our potential customers prefer an assigned seat. Further, when a customer defects from Southwest to one of our competitors, our open seating policy is cited as the number one reason why. The answer is clear, there is more demand for Southwest Airlines with an assigned seating model, and there is a significant ability to monetize the cabin more effectively with a premium seating option. By extension, these changes are expected to drive significant value for our shareholders. We feel confident that the solution we are implementing will retain the positive elements of the Southwest Airlines experience and enable us to evolve in a manner that’s consistent with what today’s air traveler is seeking. While specific cabin layouts are still being finalized, we expect roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom. We’re also designing a boarding process that retains the organized com our customers enjoy today, but also complements an assigned seating model. We’ve been studying this in depth to preserve our operational efficiency and how quickly we turn an aircraft. We’ve conducted both live boarding tests to understand passenger movement in a real world environment and also more than 8 million digital simulations to test different boarding options.” Overall LUV ranks 1st on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of LUV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Consensus ROE: 24% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 47 The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is one of the most well known consumer beauty products companies in the world. Since it is a prestige beauty brand company, naturally, the shares do not perform well when inflation is high. This has been the case recently, as The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)’s shares have lost 34.7% and 32.51% year to date and over the past twelve months, respectively. A large portion of this underperformance has been because of the firm’s woes in China where economic troubles have been more severe and longstanding compared to the West. During its fiscal year 2024, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)’s Asia/Pacific sales dropped by 6% annually, and the firm attributed the drop primarily to China. Asia/Pacific accounted for 31% of the firm’s sales in FY24, making the drops hard hitting on its impact statement. Travel retail is another troubled segment for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and a drop in Asia sales further impacted earnings. With the overall sentiment remaining dour, here’s what The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shared for its FY25 outlook during the Q4 FY24 earnings call: “Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 outlook reflects continued declines in the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. While the PRGP, which remains on track relatively to our previously stated goals, enable us to offset the pressure to profitability from declines in areas of our business that have high penetration of skin care, it yields a slower pace of operating margin expansions for fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected when we expanded the PRGP in February. For fiscal year 2025, in the rest of our global business, we are planning to deliver improved performance across both developed and emerging markets. To fuel this, our strategic priorities are reigniting skin care, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrance, moving faster in leveraging winning channels, launching accretive innovation inclusive of new, big opportunities and enhancing our precision marketing capabilities for increased effectiveness and efficiency of our consumer facing investments. The PRGP enables and accelerates these strategy priorities and is the foundation to restore sustainable long-term organic sales growth and to rebuild our operating profitability. We are also creating a faster and leaner organization that will more quickly adapt to market dynamics and be better able to leverage future growth. While our sales and profit outlook for fiscal year 2025 is disappointing, this year we will make important strides as we implement our strategy reset to continue rebalancing regional growth, deliver improved annual profitability, strengthen go-to-market and innovation capabilities to elevate our execution in response to a more competitive market. These efforts will position us to both outperform the prestige beauty industry in fiscal year 2026 and accelerate profitability expansion.” Overall EL ranks 13th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of EL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior manager studying a market index alongside a team of young stock market analysts. Consensus ROE: 24% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 39 Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) is a Texas based natural gas infrastructure company. On the surface, this would imply that the firm has struggled this year as dropping natural gas prices have led to lower gas output and consequently lower demand for natural gas and associated infrastructure. However, in reality, Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)’s shares are up a cool 88% year to date which suggests that something else is brewing under the hood. We don’t have to look too far to find out what this is, as the firm has benefited from its presence in America’s hottest oil producing region, the Permian Basin. Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)’s presence in the Permian has allowed it to benefit from a growth in gas production there. Permian accounted for 5.8% of America’s gas production in 2011, and in 2022, its share jumped to 18.6%. Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) also benefits from the fact that it operates in the gas marketing business. This enables it to avoid supply chain bullwhips to an extent and gauge the demand for gas early on to ensure it does not over or under invest in capacity. Since Permian is quite important to Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)’s operations, here’s what management had to say about it during the Q2 2024 earnings call: “Activity in the Permian remains very strong, supporting our view of continued long-term growth from the basin. Our Permian volumes during the second quarter increased about 275 million cubic feet per day over the first quarter, which is a full plant. And year-over-year, our volumes in the Permian are up more than 600 million cubic feet per day. And currently, our volumes in the Permian are up another 200 million cubic feet per day compared to the second quarter. We expected strong growth from our Permian assets, but the growth we have seen this year has exceeded our expectations. We now expect low double-digit percentage volume growth this year, which sets us up well for meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. This higher growth rate is driving incremental EBITDA and requiring additional growth capital investment. These volumes are core to our business, and we benefit across the integrated NGL value chain, driving higher margins into our downstream business and generating strong ROIC. Given higher-than-anticipated Permian volumes and an outlook for continued strong activity across our Midland and Delaware footprint, we announced our next two plants in the Permian, one in the Midland Basin and another in the Delaware Basin. Some spending for these plans was included in the forecast we provided back in February, but the timing and cadence of spending has accelerated.” Overall TRGP ranks 14th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of TRGP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TRGP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ECB officials urge Bitcoin latecomers, non-holders to oppose Bitcoin and advocate for legislation against it
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-wealth-redistribution-ecb/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T19:54:20Z
Full Content:
Share this article Those who have been late to Bitcoin or don’t own the coin have good reasons to oppose it and advocate legislation to protect themselves from its negative consequences of wealth redistribution, according to a recent analysis authored by ECB officials Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaff. The authors, who said Bitcoin’s February price rally was driven by price manipulation in an earlier report, claim Bitcoin has shifted from its original vision as a decentralized payment system to primarily an investment asset. The argument is backed by the growing support for Bitcoin from high-profile figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink or Galaxy Digital’s founder Mike Novogratz, who view Bitcoin as a pure investment asset. Their perspective is that Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing demand will drive its price up, similar to gold. However, ECB officials assert that Bitcoin’s limited supply doesn’t guarantee sustained price increases, contrary to popular belief among crypto supporters. “There are countless assets on earth with a limited or finite supply, and for none of them the notion that they can sustain an ever-increasing valuation over the long term, regardless of the services or benefits they provide to society, is particularly plausible,” the report states. “Proponents of the Bitcoin investment perspective ignore the fact that “scarcity” describes the relationship between supply and demand. A limited, finite supply does not equate to scarcity. In the context of Bitcoin with its limited and fixed supply the non-economic term “rarity” seems more appropriate. If supply is fixed, the price becomes exclusively dependent on demand. And if the demand were to disappear, the price would be zero,” it says. The authors warn that even in a scenario where Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, it could lead to negative economic consequences if not justified by the underlying fundamentals. They argue that Bitcoin doesn’t enhance the economy’s productive capacity, and any wealth generated by Bitcoin holders comes at the expense of others in society. “This redistribution of wealth and purchasing power is unlikely to occur without detrimental consequences for society,” the report claims. “Early adopters have a vested interest in promoting Bitcoin values to redistribute wealth and consumption from latecomers to themselves, maybe without being conscious of the redistributive nature of their vision,” it states. “In any case current non-holders should realize that they have compelling reasons to oppose Bitcoin and advocate for legislation against it, aiming to prevent Bitcoin prices from rising or to see Bitcoin disappear altogether. Latecomers and non-holders and their political representatives should emphasize that the idea of Bitcoin as an investment relies on redistribution at their expense,” it adds. The authors also warn that failing to do so could lead to electoral outcomes favoring politicians who support pro-Bitcoin policies, which could exacerbate wealth inequality and societal divisions by promoting a system that benefits early adopters while disadvantaging latecomers and non-holders. It’s not the first time ECB officials have shown their skepticism towards Bitcoin. As Crypto Briefing reported, ECB officials previously likened the approval of US Bitcoin ETFs to the ‘Naked Emperor’s New Clothes.’ The ECB faced social backlash as soon as the paper surfaced. Wall Street veteran Max Keiser criticized the paper for making false claims about Bitcoin’s original purpose. The @ecb makes a rookie mistake by claiming Bitcoin originated as a payment means. This is false. The word ‘Cash’ in the White Paper refers to money, as in Gold, not fiat currency. Bitcoin has always been digital Gold. Satoshi makes this clear in subsequent posts & messages. pic.twitter.com/qEMhoNDWpE — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 19, 2024 Blockstream advisor Tuur Demeester, who first brought the paper to public attention, believes the ECB’s paper is “a true declaration of war” and that authorities will use it to justify harsh taxes or bans on Bitcoin. Demeester warns that the paper could have serious consequences for Bitcoin and its supporters, urging holders to take action to protect the rights of individuals to hold Bitcoin. 1/ This new paper is a true declaration of war: the ECB claims that early #bitcoin adopters steal economic value from latecomers. I strongly believe authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans. Check 🧵 for why: pic.twitter.com/qg31YenTSC — Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) October 19, 2024 Following critical remarks by the ECB in February, Bitcoin established a new record high in mid-March. After the rally, Bitcoin experienced price corrections but it remains solid above $45,000. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $68,100, up over 60% year-to-date, per TradingView.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is an American multinational corporation operating as a semiconductor company worldwide. The company is trying to establish itself as a key player in AI-powered personal computers (AIPCs), driving innovation in hardware to support advanced, next-generation applications. By integrating technology across CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, it strives to create a strong ecosystem that supports the development of powerful AI applications. AMD held its Advancing AI 2024 event on October 10, 2024. At its AI event in San Francisco, AMD revealed its latest AI data center processors and new PC and server chips. In particular, the MI325X chip, built on the same architecture as the MI300X, incorporates a new memory variant designed to accelerate AI-related tasks. Vendors like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) are expected to begin shipping AMD's new AI chip to customers in Q1 2025. AMD aims to use the chip to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips. AMD also plans to launch its next-gen MI2350 chips that will be more powerful than the MI325 series chips. Regardless, the stock’s share ended the day down by 4% following the AI event. As per Bernstein Research analysts, its GPU faces a “Zero challenge” against Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip. "Even the company's MI350X tease shows raw performance that, while on par with Blackwell on paper, arrives a year later, just in time to compete against Nvidia's next offerings. Hence we do not see even AMD's accelerated road map closing the competitive gap." - Bernstein Research analysts. Vivek Arya, research analyst at Bank of America Securities, further notes how there is "no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic" between the company and its chip rivals. "Training performance seems 1 year behind Blackwell (on par with H200) while inferencing is only slightly better”. -Vivek Arya On the other hand, Jefferies and Bank of America both maintained Buy ratings for the stock as of Friday (October 11), with price targets of $190 and $180, respectively, while 13 of 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha also rated it a "buy," with a consensus target of $192.13. In other news, the US is weighing on capping exports of AI chips from both Nvidia and AMD on a country-specific basis. This move is going to limit some countries’ artificial intelligence capabilities. Officials are particularly focused on Persian Gulf countries, and discussions are still in the early and fluid stages, but interest in the policy has increased recently. Last month, Commerce Department officials introduced these regulations, with more rules expected in the future. Overall AMD ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end.

Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

This company provides the world’s leading chipmakers with the power to mass-produce patterns on silicon, thereby helping them make their chips faster, smaller, and greener. In a recent turn of events, this tech company and key supplier of chip-making equipment accidentally published its Q3 earnings report a day early on Tuesday, October 15th. Following the accidental release, ASML stock plunged 16% on the back of weaker-than-expected bookings as well as a reduced sales forecast for 2025. While the Dutch company posted strong third-quarter results, they were dampened by lower-than-expected net bookings of €2.6 billion, falling short of forecasts that ranged between €4 billion and €6 billion. "ASML's fat finger error isn't cause for concern in itself, but the content of the release didn't make comforting reading for investors”. -Derren Nathan, head of equity research, Hargreaves Lansdown. ASML's reduced 2025 net sales guidance, driven by delays in EUV demand, alarmed investors and shook the market. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover. It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.

Title: SCHD: Split or Not, This Is a Strong Dividend ETF

Time Published: 2024-10-19T18:18:46Z

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market today with a massive $63.7 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund recently made some waves by executing a 3-for-1 split which went into effect on October 10th. We’ll discuss the rationale and details regarding the share split in this article. But more importantly, we’ll evaluate the merits of holding SCHD in an investment portfolio. I’m bullish on this well-known dividend ETF based on the strength of its attractive yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated dividend stocks, and an ultra-low expense ratio. According to fund sponsor Charles Schwab, SCHD’s strategy is simply to invest in an index called the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The index is “focused on the quality and sustainability of dividends.” The fund also “invests in stocks selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.” As one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market, SCHD recently made some waves when it conducted a 3-for-1 stock split that went effective on October 10, 2024. It’s much more common for company stocks to split than ETFs, and here is a rare case where an exchange-traded fund has split. The split doesn’t have any fundamental impact on SCHD’s investment prospects. What’s occurred is that investors now own three shares of SCHD for every one share previously held, while the market price of the ETF is 1/3 the value it would be without the split. A share split has some minor benefits, such as the lower price per share making it easier for smaller investors to establish an investment. A stock split can also enhance liquidity. It may also trigger increased options activity on the ticker (an options contract consists of 100 shares). But with all that said, the outlook for SCHD stock should be no different now than if no split had taken place. Many popular stocks that have engaged in stock splits over the past year, like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), had share prices of well over $1,000 a share, making a split more meaningful. Those splits made it significantly more affordable for investors to buy a share, or one lot (100) of shares. SCHD, on the other hand, was trading at just under $85 per share before the split, so the need for a split seemed less apparent here. The ability to buy fractional shares on brokerages like Robinhood (HOOD) and others also mitigates the need for stock splits to some degree. Regardless, at the end of the day, this is the same solid dividend ETF with the same holdings it had prior to the share split. The SCHD ETF offers sound diversification to investors. It owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 41.0% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of SCHD’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool. As you can see, the fund owns a plethora of well-known dividend stocks, ranging from top holding Home Depot (HD), to BlackRock (BLK), to Lockheed Martin (LMT). In addition to being blue-chip dividend stocks, another thing that these top holdings have in common is that they offer strong Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. The score is data-driven and does not involve any human interpretation. Impressively, eight stocks from SCHD’s top 10 holdings have Smart Scores of eight or better. The Smart Score system also rates SCHD itself favorably, giving it an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8. Beyond being top dividend stocks, another nice thing about SCHD’s holdings is that overall, they are fairly inexpensive. The ETF’s holdings currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6x. This is another reason I’m bullish on the ETF. While a 17.6x P/E ratio isn’t dirt cheap, it’s considerably more affordable than the broader market at a time when the S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7x. This means that SCHD and its holdings probably offer a bit more downside protection than the broader market, and potentially have a bit more room for upside from multiple expansion. The fund also carries a beta of 0.74. This means that SCHD’s share price is only about three-quarters as volatile as the broader market. This adds credence to SCHD’s defensive qualities (as discussed above in the valuation section) which can be attractive for investors seeking to avoid volatility. SCHD has generated solid returns for its shareholders over the years. As of September 30th, the ETF has produced a three-year annualized return of 8.2%, a five-year annualized return of 13.0%, and a 10-year annualized return of 11.7%. It’s worth noting that SCHD has lagged behind broad market funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) over each of these time frames (for reference, VOO has posted an annualized five-year return of 15.9%). That is likely attributable to the growth opportunities many non-dividend paying companies have available. SCHD’s underperformance against the S&P 500 index (SPX), and its tracking ETFs, comes at a time when many large-cap tech stocks with small (or no) dividends have powered the index. If we return to an environment where more value-oriented dividend stocks are favored again, SCHD could outperform the broad market. For example, SCHD has slightly outperformed VOO over the past three months in what has been a volatile time for tech stocks. Regardless of comparisons, double-digit returns over a 10-year time horizon, like SCHD has delivered, are nothing to scoff at. Furthermore, for investors who own a large number of high-flying tech stocks, SCHD could provide worthwhile diversification benefits. The SCHD ETF currently yields 3.4%. This is an attractive yield and more than double the current yield of the S&P 500. That’s pretty attractive. Furthermore, the fund has a track record of dividend consistency. SCHD has paid a dividend for 12 straight years, and increased its payout annually. The dividend payout has been growing at a solid 12% clip over the past five years, so investors can likely expect continued increases in payouts over time. Unless, of course, hard times hit Corporate America, forcing some companies to cut their dividend. SCHD charges a bargain-bin expense ratio of just 0.06%. This means that an investor with $10,000 in the fund will pay just $6 in fees over the course of a year. It’s hard to argue with this expense ratio; it’s less than the price of a fast-food lunch these days. The savings from a low-fee investment fund like SCHD can really add up over time. Assuming that the current expense ratio remains the same, and the fund returns 5% per year on an annualized basis going forward, an investor putting $10,000 into SCHD would pay just $77 in fees over the course of a decade. Turning to Wall Street, SCHD earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 54 Buys, 37 Holds, and 10 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SCHD stock price target of $30.16 implies about 5% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on SCHD based on its attractive 3.4% dividend yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated blue-chip dividend stocks, the relatively inexpensive valuation of these holdings, and the fund’s investor-friendly expense ratio. The recent 3-for-1 split was an interesting development but ultimately doesn’t change much for the ETF or its holders. The one downside of SCHD is that it has lagged the broader market over the years, despite posting respectable double-digit annualized returns. As noted above, some of SCHD’s underperformance versus the S&P 500 is due to the dominant performance of large-cap tech stocks, companies that don’t generally pay attractive dividends. SCHD stock could be serve a valuable purpose in an investor’s portfolio, by delivering strong dividend income and lower volatility. SCHD could also outperform should investors rotate away from growth and back toward value-oriented dividend stocks. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

In addition to being blue-chip dividend stocks, another thing that these top holdings have in common is that they offer strong Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. The score is data-driven and does not involve any human interpretation. Impressively, eight stocks from SCHD’s top 10 holdings have Smart Scores of eight or better. The Smart Score system also rates SCHD itself favorably, giving it an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8. Beyond being top dividend stocks, another nice thing about SCHD’s holdings is that overall, they are fairly inexpensive. The ETF’s holdings currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6x. This is another reason I’m bullish on the ETF. While a 17.6x P/E ratio isn’t dirt cheap, it’s considerably more affordable than the broader market at a time when the S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7x. This means that SCHD and its holdings probably offer a bit more downside protection than the broader market, and potentially have a bit more room for upside from multiple expansion. The fund also carries a beta of 0.74. This means that SCHD’s share price is only about three-quarters as volatile as the broader market. This adds credence to SCHD’s defensive qualities (as discussed above in the valuation section) which can be attractive for investors seeking to avoid volatility. SCHD has generated solid returns for its shareholders over the years. As of September 30th, the ETF has produced a three-year annualized return of 8.2%, a five-year annualized return of 13.0%, and a 10-year annualized return of 11.7%. It’s worth noting that SCHD has lagged behind broad market funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) over each of these time frames (for reference, VOO has posted an annualized five-year return of 15.9%). That is likely attributable to the growth opportunities many non-dividend paying companies have available. SCHD’s underperformance against the S&P 500 index (SPX), and its tracking ETFs, comes at a time when many large-cap tech stocks with small (or no) dividends have powered the index. If we return to an environment where more value-oriented dividend stocks are favored again, SCHD could outperform the broad market. For example, SCHD has slightly outperformed VOO over the past three months in what has been a volatile time for tech stocks. Regardless of comparisons, double-digit returns over a 10-year time horizon, like SCHD has delivered, are nothing to scoff at. Furthermore, for investors who own a large number of high-flying tech stocks, SCHD could provide worthwhile diversification benefits. The SCHD ETF currently yields 3.4%. This is an attractive yield and more than double the current yield of the S&P 500. That’s pretty attractive. Furthermore, the fund has a track record of dividend consistency. SCHD has paid a dividend for 12 straight years, and increased its payout annually. The dividend payout has been growing at a solid 12% clip over the past five years, so investors can likely expect continued increases in payouts over time. Unless, of course, hard times hit Corporate America, forcing some companies to cut their dividend. SCHD charges a bargain-bin expense ratio of just 0.06%. This means that an investor with $10,000 in the fund will pay just $6 in fees over the course of a year. It’s hard to argue with this expense ratio; it’s less than the price of a fast-food lunch these days. The savings from a low-fee investment fund like SCHD can really add up over time. Assuming that the current expense ratio remains the same, and the fund returns 5% per year on an annualized basis going forward, an investor putting $10,000 into SCHD would pay just $77 in fees over the course of a decade. Turning to Wall Street, SCHD earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 54 Buys, 37 Holds, and 10 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SCHD stock price target of $30.16 implies about 5% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on SCHD based on its attractive 3.4% dividend yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated blue-chip dividend stocks, the relatively inexpensive valuation of these holdings, and the fund’s investor-friendly expense ratio. The recent 3-for-1 split was an interesting development but ultimately doesn’t change much for the ETF or its holders. The one downside of SCHD is that it has lagged the broader market over the years, despite posting respectable double-digit annualized returns. As noted above, some of SCHD’s underperformance versus the S&P 500 is due to the dominant performance of large-cap tech stocks, companies that don’t generally pay attractive dividends. SCHD stock could be serve a valuable purpose in an investor’s portfolio, by delivering strong dividend income and lower volatility. SCHD could also outperform should investors rotate away from growth and back toward value-oriented dividend stocks. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: SCHD: Split or Not, This Is a Strong Dividend ETF

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market today with a massive $63.7 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund recently made some waves by executing a 3-for-1 split which went into effect on October 10th. We’ll discuss the rationale and details regarding the share split in this article. But more importantly, we’ll evaluate the merits of holding SCHD in an investment portfolio. I’m bullish on this well-known dividend ETF based on the strength of its attractive yield, its diversified portfolio of highly-rated dividend stocks, and an ultra-low expense ratio. According to fund sponsor Charles Schwab, SCHD’s strategy is simply to invest in an index called the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The index is “focused on the quality and sustainability of dividends.” The fund also “invests in stocks selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.” As one of the most popular dividend ETFs in the market, SCHD recently made some waves when it conducted a 3-for-1 stock split that went effective on October 10, 2024. It’s much more common for company stocks to split than ETFs, and here is a rare case where an exchange-traded fund has split. The split doesn’t have any fundamental impact on SCHD’s investment prospects. What’s occurred is that investors now own three shares of SCHD for every one share previously held, while the market price of the ETF is 1/3 the value it would be without the split. A share split has some minor benefits, such as the lower price per share making it easier for smaller investors to establish an investment. A stock split can also enhance liquidity. It may also trigger increased options activity on the ticker (an options contract consists of 100 shares). But with all that said, the outlook for SCHD stock should be no different now than if no split had taken place. Many popular stocks that have engaged in stock splits over the past year, like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), had share prices of well over $1,000 a share, making a split more meaningful. Those splits made it significantly more affordable for investors to buy a share, or one lot (100) of shares. SCHD, on the other hand, was trading at just under $85 per share before the split, so the need for a split seemed less apparent here. The ability to buy fractional shares on brokerages like Robinhood (HOOD) and others also mitigates the need for stock splits to some degree. Regardless, at the end of the day, this is the same solid dividend ETF with the same holdings it had prior to the share split. The SCHD ETF offers sound diversification to investors. It owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 41.0% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of SCHD’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool. As you can see, the fund owns a plethora of well-known dividend stocks, ranging from top holding Home Depot (HD), to BlackRock (BLK), to Lockheed Martin (LMT).

Title: Analysts Say Apple AI Would Not Be a Catalyst for Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO)

Time Published: 2024-10-19T18:12:53Z

We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Wall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said: “I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.” The analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however. “My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.” For this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a highly advanced mobile device with the company's branding visible. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 37 Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) was recently downgraded by Morgan Stanley. The firm cited “limited upside” and a lack of near-term catalysts for the move. Analyst Joseph Moore explained that weak conditions in the Android supply chain and broader market challenges are limiting the Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO)’s expected gross margin recovery. While maintaining a positive long-term view, Moore sees a balanced risk-reward scenario for the next few quarters. “We see limited upside near term around a weaker Android supply chain and weak broad market conditions, which is limiting the gross margin recovery that we have been looking for,” Moore wrote in a note to clients. “We remain constructive longer term, but see a balanced risk reward over the next couple of quarters.” As a result, Moore downgraded Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO)’s rating from Overweight to Equal-Weight and reduced the price target from $130 to $120. He noted that although artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge could boost the smartphone cycle, Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) is unlikely to be a significant beneficiary at the outset. “Apple Intelligence looks to be the initial Edge AI winner, and our US hardware team has high conviction this will [lead] to a multi-year upgrade cycle,” Moore continued. “While Qorvo is committed to increasing exposure to Apple (AAPL), they are underrepresented in the iOS ecosystem and are still primarily seen as an Android play. Since Edge AI is expected to initially be in the premium tier, where we expect Android to lose share next year, we are less excited about Edge AI as a catalyst for Qorvo.” Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) is a semiconductor and wireless products company. Apple is its biggest customer. Qorvo has made progress on several fronts, such as reducing operational inefficiencies linked to manufacturing smaller wafer diameters and transitioning to larger formats, culminating in the migration to 8-inch BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) technology in FQ1. However, there are many risks to Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO), including its dependence on China.China accounts for about 19% of its revenues. This dependence could become detrimental if 60% tariffs are imposed on Chinese goods after the November U.S. elections, potentially triggering a tit-for-tat response from Beijing that would make Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO)’s products more expensive. Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) is also competing with giants like Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are also integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that produce some of their connectivity chips. This sector has become increasingly commoditized, leading to more price-based competition. Vulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) is a leader in radio frequency (RF) systems and power management solutions for mobile devices, wireless infrastructure, aerospace and defense, the Internet of Things, and various other applications. Qorvo’s chipsets are a small cost but are critical components in modern mobile devices. As data needs increase and telecommunications technology continues to evolve and become more complex, more RF content is needed in each device. The complexity and barriers to entry intensify as content requirements increase and space constraints become more pronounced. Qorvo operates in an oligopoly with only a small number of companies capable of producing these increasingly complex chipsets at scale. Qorvo should also benefit as growth accelerates in adjacent markets and these markets eventually become a larger piece of the business through the adoption of the Internet of Things, satellite, Wi-Fi, and other markets. The company has faced headwinds over the past few years including lower demand in China, excess inventory in the channel, and factory underutilization; but secular tailwinds should drive growth and, in turn, margin expansion.” Overall, Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QRVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Copyright: melpomen / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65 Citi Research predicts that capital expenditures for data centers among the leading four cloud companies will surge by 40% year over year, offering a boost to data center interconnect (DCI) providers. Citi anticipates top tech companies will ramp up their data center investments by 40% to 50% in 2025. Citi analysts, led by Atif Malik, noted in an investor report that “we estimate that the AI networking opportunity is expanding beyond the server connection within a data center to AI platforms connecting multiple data centers through DCI.” The main beneficiaries of this growth are expected to be DCI providers like Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). Malik emphasized the challenges of containing AI model clusters within a single data center as their size approaches 300,000 GPUs by 2025, stating that “containing models in one data center unit will not be sustainable in the long term amid constraints related to power, regulations, among others.” Consequently, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting and planning to expand the use of a multi-data center training approach. Citi highlighted that Google has utilized this multi-data center strategy for training its Gemini 1 Ultra, and that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are also embracing this model. As a result of increased DCI spending, Citi projects that Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET)’s revenue could grow by up to 25% year over year in 2025, primarily driven by Ethernet switching in AI networks. Citi has raised its price target for Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) to $460 from $385 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The Information recently reported that Meta Platforms is preparing a cluster of over 100,000 NVIDIA H-100 GPUs to train the latest version of its Llama language model. Evercore ISI believes Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) is likely to be the networking partner for Meta Platforms’ cluster. Ethernet will handle the networking for the project, as InfiniBand isn’t capable of supporting a cluster of this scale, leading Evercore to believe Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) will supply some of the infrastructure. “Assuming GPU’s represent 80% of total spend on this AI cluster, this would imply total cost of around $2.5B, of which 10% is likely spent on infrastructure,” said Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani, in a note. “This could represent a $250M revenue opportunity for Arista, if they won the business.” Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) has previously worked with Meta, providing switches for a cluster with 24,000 GPUs. Daryanani noted that their strong relationship makes it likely Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) will supply the switches for this new cluster. If successful, this could boost Arista’s $750 million AI revenue target for 2025. Evercore maintains an Outperform rating on Arista with a $400 price target. What makes Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) a promising AI stock? Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) is set to gain amid the AI-driven shift to high-speed networks due to its open Ethernet design and unified Arista EOS. The company’s partnership with Broadcom also created an opportunity for Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) to expand its integrated software and hardware solutions. Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) claims its Ethernet architecture based on merchant silicon allows fast deployment for major hyperscalers and Tier-2 cloud providers. Madison Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “We trimmed our positions in Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) and Carlisle Companies. Both of these companies have witnessed strong multi-year growth in their stock prices, which have resulted in elevated valuations. While we remain confident in the long-term prospects of both of these businesses, we trimmed our holdings to more appropriate position sizes given the risk/reward offered.” Overall, Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: MongoDB, Inc. (MDB) Receives Analyst Upgrades With Increased Price Targets Amid Strong AI and Cloud Software Growth

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:MDB) provides a general-purpose database platform worldwide. It harnesses AI to streamline the building of AI-enriched applications, enhance generative AI deployments, and integrate machine learning models. For instance, MongoDB Atlas, the cloud-based version of MongoDB, helps streamline the building of AI-enriched applications by unifying operational, unstructured, and AI-related data. Following a strong second-quarter performance, MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) has been the focus of several positive analyst reviews. On October 11, DA Davidson analyst Rudy Kessinger maintained a Buy rating on MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) and raised the price target from $330 to $340. Highlighting a recent discussion with the management of MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), DA Davidson highlighted the challenges of holding MongoDB stock for short-term investors due to unpredictable consumption growth trends, yet continues to endorse it for long-term investors. Piper Sandler has also been reinforcing MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) as a worthwhile investment stock in cloud software, alongside two other stocks. "We recommend large-cap growth investors to take on more risk and increase their position in 'MAC' (MAC refers to Adobe, MongoDB, and Salesforce). These are stocks that have underperformed market expectations, with average prices still 26% below their 52-week highs, despite having healthy product and profit catalysts, as well as favorable risk-return profiles”.

Title: SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Trading On NYSE, Cboe – Details

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted a go-ahead to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) to list options trading for several spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development comes amidst the massive inflows recorded by these Bitcoin ETFs in the past week. According to filings by the SEC, NYSE and Cboe have obtained permission to list and trade options on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. Based on NYSE’s proposed rule change, the US securities regulator has allowed the exchange to provide options trading for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Meanwhile, Cboe has been greenlighted to list and trade options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Interestingly, both exchanges gained “accelerated approval” from the Commission which means authorization was granted before the usual 30-day public comment period on the proposed amendments had elapsed according to Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, an accelerated approval usually happens when the Commission decides that waiting for a full 30 days is not necessary for the public protection of market stability or there is a good cause to fast-track the process as in the case of NYSE and Cboe. Commenting on this development, Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchumas has expressed no surprise although applauding the SEC’s decision. Balchunas said: They approved same thing for Nasdaq recently so not a big surprise but still good news as SEC was big hurdle. We hearing good things about the rest of process altho exact timeline for listing date still unclear. Before NYSE and Cboe, the SEC had approved Nasdaq to list and trade options on the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This represents the first approval for spot Bitcoin ETF options trading and came nine months after application with the SEC. Options trading refers to buying and selling contracts that grant traders the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset e.g.ETF at a predetermined price, albeit within a specific time frame. With six of the active spots of Bitcoin ETFs eligible for options trading, investors in these institutional funds are exposed to new trading strategies in terms of hedging against volatility or evening leveraging on Bitcoin’s price movement. Bitwise executive Jeff Park sheds more light on these in what he calls “free leverage”. Park said: ETF options will have cross-margining capabilities in multi-asset portfolios, which single-asset exchanges like Derbit can never provide. Only spot ETF options can leverage your GLD, SPY, HYG ETFs, bonds, and cross-margin to achieve uncharted capital efficiency-the closest thing to free leverage. Ultimately, this will result in increased institutional interest in an already booming spot Bitcoin ETF market which boasts over $65 billion in total net assets in ten months of trading.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

On October 14, Needham analyst James Ricchiuti raised the price target for Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) to $120, up from $84.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-uber-technologies-inc-155809667.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:58:09Z

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE.

Consensus ROE: 45% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 145 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is the largest ride sharing services provider in the US. The firm has leveraged its online platform to provide additional services as well such as food delivery. In fact, along with being the largest ride sharing company, the firm is also the second biggest food delivery company in the US after DoorDash. As a result, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) benefits from earning from multiple businesses. These also enable the firm to target high growth initiatives such as air taxis, autonomous ride sharing vehicles, and dedicated shuttles. Starting from air taxis, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has invested $125 million into Joby Aviation as of 2020. For autonomous vehicles and shuttles, the firm has teamed up with General Motors to create a robotaxi service, and in October, the firm started a pilot program in New York to ferry users between Midtown New York and LaGuardia Airport. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s existing market position means that it remains the preferred partner for autonomous vehicles, which could work in its favor down the road. RiverPark Advisors mentioned Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.4 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.8 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $165 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.” Overall UBER ranks 5th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is the dominant player in the global electric vehicle industry. Along with EVs, the firm also makes other products such as energy storage equipment to enable building owners to rely on solar energy for their power. However, 84% of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s revenue comes from electric vehicles, which makes the stock vulnerable to downswings in the cyclical product category. This has also been the case lately, with the stock down 3% year to date and 8.6% over the past year. The drops are due to a slowdown in the EV industry stemming from high interest rates and weakening demand. Additionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long enjoyed the status of being one of the few large scale EV makers in the world. However, with new companies entering the market, the firm will have to leverage existing economies of scale to compete on the cost front – a strategy that could erode margins and affect profitability. During this critical period, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s scale, as is evident by its 1.85 million EV production capacity in 2023, its sizeable data repository of 1.3 billion miles for training autonomous systems, and a semi diversified business that saw energy storage revenue double to $3 billion in Q2 should come to the firm’s aid. However, Goldman was of mixed mind after Tesla’s We, Robot event as it criticized a lack of detail for business plans but sounded optimistic about the humanoid robot prototype Optimus. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period” Overall TSLA ranks 41st on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Arm Holdings plc (ARM) Teams Up with Industry Leaders to Launch Advanced AI CPU Chiplet Platform for Cloud and HPC Applications

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Title: BlackRock in Talks With Crypto Exchanges About Using Its BUIDL Token As Derivatives Collateral: Report

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly in talks with numerous crypto exchange platforms about using its proprietary token BUIDL as collateral for derivatives contracts. According to a new report by Bloomberg, anonymous people familiar with the matter say the world’s largest asset manager is exploring the idea of utilizing BUIDL – the crypto asset related to the firm’s tokenized mutual fund – as collateral for trading derivatives contracts. BUIDL, which launched in March of this year and stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that offers blue-chip traders yields. Bloomberg says the crypto exchanges BlackRock is in talks with include Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, as well as OKX and Deribit. Previously, it was reported that the fund invests in cash, US Treasury Bills, and repurchase agreements and sends dividends directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens every month. As stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a press release issued by Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, “[BUIDL] is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients.” In April, stablecoin issuer Circle launched a new smart contract function that permits holders of BUIDL to convert their tokens into USDC. At the time, Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire said that the new functionality would allow “investors to move out of tokenized assets at speed, lowering costs and removing friction.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: BlackRock Seeks To Push BUIDL As Derivative Collateral In Crypto Market – Details

Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:00:28Z

The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, aims to expand its foray in the digital asset industry following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024. In a new venture, the American asset manager is attempting to push the adoption of its money-market token BUIDL as a collateral asset in the crypto derivative market. According to a Friday report by Bloomberg, BlackRock has begun marketing BUIDL as collateral in the crypto derivative market. For context, BUIDL – which stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund – is a tokenized fund issued on the Ethereum blockchain offering institutional investors access to achieving US dollar yields. Similar to stablecoins, BUIDL is pegged to a stable value of $1 per unit and invests in assets such as US dollars, US treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Following its launch in March, BUIDL has experienced remarkable growth amassing $550 million in AUM to become the largest tokenized fund in the market. In order to facilitate further growth of BUIDL, Bloomberg states that BlackRock in conjunction with its broker Securitize has begun discussions with major exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit to introduce the money-market token as a collateral asset for derivative trading on their respective platforms. BlackRock will aim to charge traders a management fee of 0.5% in line with its current standard policy. However, the use of BUIDL is only restricted to eligible institutional investors with a minimum investment quota of $5 million. Currently, crypto prime brokers such as FalconX and Hidden Road have already authorized their customers to use BUIDL as a collateral asset for trading. However, a potential entry into the derivatives market of powerhouse exchanges such as Binance and OKX presents a significant opportunity to exponentially increase the market influence of the tokenized find. In launching BUIDL in the crypto derivative trading, BlackRock will experience powerful opposition from Tether’s USDT which ranks as the most common asset for collateral in the crypto derivative market. USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin and third-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $120 billion. At present, there are no confirmative comments from BlackRock or the mentioned crypto exchanges on any planned introduction of BUIDL in crypto derivative trading. However, the successful execution of this initiative would represent another outstanding milestone in the investment firm’s digital asset campaign. BlackRock already presents the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with respective net assets of $25.79 billion and $1.26 billion according to data from SoSoValue. By securing a collateral asset in the crypto derivative market, which produced nearly three-quarters of crypto trading volume in September, BlackRock could expand its reach in the digital asset industry.

Title: Amazon employees gripe about their work culture on social media
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/19/amazon-employees-complaints-work-culture-return-to-office-mandate-andy-jassy/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T14:32:34Z
Full Content:
Amazon.com Inc. workers’ complaints about company culture — a frequent sight on anonymous and internal forums — turned public this week with a popular LinkedIn post that struck a chord with current employees. The post, by former Amazon worker Stephanie Ramos, criticized bureaucracy at the company. “Instead of the exciting, fast-paced environment I remember, I experienced a place bogged down in pointless meetings and middling middle managers,” wrote Ramos, explaining why she quit her job less than three months after being rehired by Amazon. Ramos posted her thoughts Monday afternoon. By the end of the week, more than 100,000 people had viewed it, she said in an interview. Of the more than 200 people who commented on her post, about 20 are currently employed by Amazon in various departments around the world – and many were critical of the company. Some lambasted Amazon’s direction under Andy Jassy, who assumed the chief executive officer role from co-founder Jeff Bezos three years ago. “Love him or hate him, Bezos had courage and a vision — he had real all-hands meetings that weren’t prerecorded with hard questions,” wrote Todd Leonhardt, whose LinkedIn profile describes him as an Amazon Web Services software developer in Virginia. Another person, Laura Barry, whose LinkedIn profile says she’s worked at Amazon for nearly 20 years, wrote that the company today reminded her of a bank. She pointed to the new policy of requiring workers to be in the office five days a week. “I’m waiting for a dress code to be implemented after 5 days a week starts,” she commented on the post. “Hide those tattoos!” Employee complaints are common at any company, but the public forum made this week’s outpouring on LinkedIn unusual. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan declined to address the specific criticisms lobbed by employees. She noted that Amazon ranked second this year in LinkedIn’s Top Companies list, a ranking of the 50 best large workplaces compiled using LinkedIn data on such things as promotions. JPMorgan Chase & Co. topped the list. Jassy’s tenure has been defined by layoffs and cost cutting — moves that pleased Wall Street investors but rankled some staff. The executive also openly criticized the company culture himself in a memo to employees in September, when he announced that the five-day policy would begin in January. Jassy said he intended to cut management layers that were slowing the company down and the return-to-office plan would help Amazon rekindle its defining culture. The announcement prompted backlash, but much of it was contained to anonymous forums such as Blind, where employees can complain under pseudonyms. Ramos, the original poster, previously worked for the company for six years as a logistics project manager before getting laid off in 2023. This year, she was rehired, but decided to quit. She didn’t mind the return to the office, she wrote, but was frustrated by the culture. She was initially nervous about posting her thoughts, but felt a sense of solidarity with her former colleagues when she saw the reactions accumulate, Ramos said. “I’m not alone,” she said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Stock market crash and panic, Of course, we all love it when the stock market soars like it has. But what if stocks pull back? We’ve already seen three big drops this year, so it’s fair to think another one could be lurking around the corner. With that in mind, it makes sense to diversify beyond stocks—especially now. There’s a type of closed-end fund (CEF) out there that’s perfect for this: those that hold municipal bonds, which are issued by state and local governments to fund infrastructure projects. CEFs, as members of my CEF Insider service know, are great buys for income (the average CEF yields around 8% today) and gains: These funds’ discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios) give us price gains as they narrow. Municipal bonds add an ingredient of stability to this gain-and-income recipe, because: Right now, there are two muni-bond CEFs out there that offer a good way to diversify away from stocks. Let’s take a look at both. Our first CEF, the Eaton Vance California Municipal Bond Fund (EVM), yields 5.3% as I write this and, as the name says, has a California-centric approach. This could make it an appealing choice for California residents, as they benefit from both federal and state tax exemptions. The downside? The fund’s focus on the state adds a level of geographic risk—should California face budget constraints or defaults on certain projects, the impact on EVM could be significant. That said, EVM holds California bonds from across various sectors, like education, healthcare and essential services. This makes the portfolio resilient—hospital and school-district bonds, after all, basically never default. Moreover, the fund emphasizes highly rated bonds, lowering credit risk and partly explaining why EVM’s 5.3% yield is a little low for a muni-bond CEF. But this is where those tax breaks make a big difference: If you’re in the highest tax bracket, its 5.3% yield packs a bigger punch than it appears to: a healthy 8.8% on a taxable-equivalent basis: EVM Tax Yield We’ll talk about the fund’s discount in a moment. But before we do that, let’s look at our second muni-bond fund: the Invesco Value Municipal Income Trust (IIM). IIM adds a degree of safety by spreading its holdings across the US muni market. That lets it cherry-pick bonds from states or municipalities offering the best risk-adjusted yields. And unlike EVM, IIM can sidestep any disaster in a specific state. Yet something does seem a bit odd here: Its yield. Because even though IIM seems to offer lower risk than EVM, it yields a much higher 7.3%. For top-bracket taxpayers, that comes out to a massive 12.1% on a taxable-equivalent basis. And that dividend recently saw a big hike after the payout drifted lower in the last few years. IIM Dividend Part of that higher yield is explained by IIM’s dividend history: As you can see above, it cut payouts in 2022 and 2023, as many muni-bond funds did, with the Fed in rate-hiking mode (thereby reducing the value of the bonds these funds hold—the opposite of today’s situation). In fact, IIM had more cuts than EVM. This stems from the “value” in its name. IIM tries to buy oversold munis with potential to rise in value or maintain their payouts more than the market expects. As a result, IIM has a mix of lower-rated bonds, with higher allocations to “revenue bonds” (where the bond’s income is tied to the income produced by an asset built by the bond’s funding, a structure commonly used for things like toll roads). These often carry more yield potential but slightly higher risk, too. This is the real reason for IIM’s bigger yield: it is investing in the riskier end of the muni world, so if you buy into it, you should be compensated for taking on that extra risk. This is where one of the most important features of CEFs comes into play. Discounts to NAV One of the key attractions of both of these CEFs is their discounts to NAV, and EVM—our California-focused fund (in orange above)—trades at a much more generous 8.6% discount as I write this. This means the higher risk from IIM, our “nationwide” fund (in purple), isn’t really being properly compensated for with the CEF’s smaller 6.3% discount, especially since its long-term 10-year average discount is 6.9%. However, EVM’s long-term discount was about 9% over that period, as well, so it doesn’t seem like EVM is unusually oversold now, either. But EVM’s bigger discount, given its lower risk profile, does suggest it’s the better pick of these two funds: While having all its eggs in California’s basket is one risk, it’s unlikely to cause major damage in the short term. Meantime, a selloff of munis more broadly could hit the market pricing of the lower-rated bonds in IIM’s portfolio. For those reasons, EVM makes more sense if you’re worried about short-term risk and want to maintain a strong income stream while you wait for stocks to dip. If you’re a California resident and looking for a conservative municipal-bond CEF with state tax benefits and strong credit quality, EVM is a great choice. Its focused portfolio and modest but solid 5.3% yield offer stability in uncertain times, and it’s probably your best bet if the market takes another tumble. If you’re bearish on the market (and California) longer term, IIM is the better buy. With its 7.2% yield, broader exposure and attractive discount, it offers a compelling combination of high income and upside, thanks to its portfolio’s value focus.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 19 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 19 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street.

The “majority” of 138 children who are currently on an “active” waiting list for spinal surgery will have had their surgery performed or will have a date for their surgery before the end of 2024, according to Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly. A spokeswoman for the health minister said: “The Minister for Health expects the majority of those currently on the active waiting list to have received a date for surgery / have had their surgery before the end of the year.” The Minister’s office was asked to clarify the position following comments made by Limerick Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins, who said that the Minister told him that the waiting list would be reduced by at least 100 patients by the end of this year, leaving 38 patients on the active list. When asked for clarity on the figures Minister Donnelly’s office replied that “as of September 27th, 362 spinal surgeries have been completed this year to date”. It explained that while “there are currently 138 children actively waiting for a date for their surgery”, a total of “38 children are currently confirmed for outsourced initiatives in Ireland and abroad”, which included “16 children (who) have received a date to come in for surgery at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh”. According to CHI newly published figures, there were 248 children on the spinal surgery waiting list as of September 27th, including 138 patients who were ready for surgery and waiting for a date; 18 patients who were assigned a surgery date; 35 patients who had “an initial episode of care” and required a further procedure; and 57 patients who were suspended from the waiting list due to clinical reasons (11 patients), personal reasons (8 patients), or patients who were confirmed to have their surgery in a non CHI hospital under a CHI initiative (38 patients). “A number of international outsourcing initiatives have been finalised for children waiting on spinal surgeries. While this option is not suitable for all children waiting on spinal surgeries, dozens of children and families will be able to avail of the option to get their surgery abroad - They include Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London,” Minister Donnelly’s office. “National outsourcing of spinal patients to Blackrock Clinic and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is already in progress.” The Minister’s office said: “CHI has implemented an extended operating theatre day and a ring-fenced theatre for spinal surgery to increase the number of procedures that are being carried out”. A Paediatric Spinal Taskforce, set up by the health minister, is being chaired by senior counsel Mark Connaughton, and includes patient advocacy groups, representatives from CHI, the HSE, the Ombudsman for Children, and the Department of Health. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Reality bites: Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement?
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/19/generation-x-retirement-denial/75731069007/

Full Content:
Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement? Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980, will be next to retire after the baby boom. It’s a generation largely defined by financial uncertainty: Generation X was the first to cope without ubiquitous workplace pensions, relying instead on a new savings tool called the 401(k). The Great Recession of 2008 stands as the generation’s defining economic event. Now, with the oldest Gen Xers pushing 60, the cohort may not be ready for its next life stage. A Wealth Watch survey from insurer New York Life is one of several recent reports that portray much of Generation X as woefully unprepared for their looming retirement. Fewer than half of Generation X, or 46%, are “actively planning for retirement,” New York Life found, even as they approach the milestone. Most of Generation X, or 70%, think they will retire “later than expected,” the survey found, “or not at all.” Only one-quarter of Gen-Xers believe they will retire on time. The survey, released in September, reached 2,230 adults. “There are a whole lot of Gen Xers who are finding themselves resigned to the fact that they’re basically going to be working forever,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, the personal finance site. Generation X’s retirement fears are not unwarranted. Gen Xers ages 45 to 54 had a median net worth of about $247,000 in 2022, according to the federal Survey of Consumer Finances. That’s less money than baby boomers had at the same age. Boomers in the 45-54 age group had a median net worth of about $265,000 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. The contrast suggests Generation X has struggled more than other age groups to recover from the Great Recession of 2008. “I think there’s this cumulative wear and tear of different circumstances Gen X has had throughout their lives,” said KC Boas, head of retirement thought leadership and marketing at BlackRock, the global investment firm. Many in Generation X entered the workforce around the time of the dot-com bubble, the tech-stock boom that went bust in 2000, sending the stock market tumbling. Several years later, many Gen Xers were in their prime earning years when the Great Recession hit. Every generation suffered in 2008, but economic research suggests Gen X suffered more than most. “Older generations were hit much harder, in some ways, because they had more to lose,” said Catherine Collinson, CEO of the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. Late baby boomers, born between 1960 and 1965, were also in their top earning years when the Great Recession descended. Today, the “Beatlemania boomers” have much less retirement savings than Americans born in the 1950s or earlier. They and Gen X suffered a similar fate. Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, have fared better. The millennial generation is in a stronger financial position now than Gen X was at the same age, according to a new LendingTree analysis. As of 2022, millennials had a median net worth of $84,941, LendingTree reports. Generation X had a lower net worth at the same age: $78,333, after adjusting for inflation. Millennials are also better-off financially than boomers were at the same age. But boomers are much more likely than Gen X or millennials to have workplace pensions, a guaranteed source of retirement income. Generation X entered the workforce as workplace pensions were fading, leaving most workers to build their own retirement savings with 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. But 401(k) plans were few and far between in the early years. Partly for that reason, many Gen Xers got a late start in retirement saving. “This all happened without access to education and guidance,” said Jessica Ruggles, corporate vice president of financial wellness at New York Life. “It wasn’t until much later that we did things like auto-enrollment and auto-contribution,” innovations that encourage higher rates of retirement saving. Schulz, of LendingTree, is 52: a quintessential Gen Xer. He got his first real job around 1995, in his early 20s. “I didn’t even really think of retirement, or anything like that, at that age,” he said. The typical Gen Xer began saving for retirement at age 30, half a decade later than millennials, according to the Transamerica Center. Today, the median Gen X household has $93,000 in retirement savings: Not nearly enough, in the eyes of many retirement planners. As a result, Transamerica found, most Gen Xers plan to keep working in retirement. Those figures come from the 2024 Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, which reached 5,730 workers. Other retirement surveys concur that Generation X faces a unique struggle in preparing for retirement. Only 60% of Gen Xers feel “on track” for retirement, the lowest share of any generation, according to the 2024 BlackRock Read on Retirement report. Three-fifths of Gen Xers worry they will outlive their retirement savings, BlackRock found. Only two-fifths of Gen Xers use a financial adviser, the lowest rate of any generation. Generation X also seems to have a credit card problem. More than one Gen X cardholder in four, or 27%, have maxed out their credit, Bankrate reported on Thursday. Gen-Xers are more likely than millennials or boomers to have exhausted their credit, the survey found. The finding is worrisome, retirement experts say, because consumers should be paying down their debt as they approach retirement, not charging it up. The Bankrate survey covered 3,576 adults. Meet the 'Beatlemania boomers.'They face a looming retirement crisis But here’s some good news, at least from a retirement perspective: Generation X is spending less on discretionary purchases in 2024, Bank of America reports. “Discretionary” is a category that covers non-essentials. And discretionary spending among Gen Xers is down 2% in the year ended August, according to internal Bank of America card data, the biggest drop of any generation. At the same time, Gen X is investing a larger share of its paycheck than other generations, according to a September report from Bank of America Institute. “Bottom line, they’re spending less and they’re investing more,” said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute. “It’s certainly a sign that Gen X is hopeful for the future. They think they will retire, and they think that in the future, those investments are going to pay off.”

Title: Mistral's models, Lightmatter's big raise, and Soniox debuts Omnio: This week in new AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. French AI startup Mistral announced two state-of-the-art edge models this week. Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B, dubbed les Ministraux, are for “on-device computing and at-the-edge use cases,” or devices such as smartphones and laptops. The models were developed “to provide a compute-efficient and low-latency solution” to companies working on applications such as “on-device translation, internet-less smart assistants,” and autonomous robots, Mistral said. Lightmatter, a startup that builds photonic tech for chips used in data centers, announced a $400 million Series D funding round this week that values the company at $4.4 billion. The round, which brings Lightmatter’s total capital raised to $850 million, was led by T. Rowe Price Associates. With the funding, Lightmatter said it plans to deploy its Passage technology to data center partners, “enabling the scaling required for sustained AI innovation.” “We’re not just advancing AI infrastructure — we’re reinventing it,” Lightmatter co-founder and chief executive Nick Harris said in a statement. “With Passage, the world’s fastest photonic engine, we’re setting a new standard for performance and breaking through the barriers that limit AI computing. This funding accelerates our ability to scale, delivering the supercomputers of tomorrow today.” Soniox, a startup focused on voice AI, debuted its multimodal AI model, Omnio, which the company claims can “understand” audio and text inputs. Omnio “excels at identifying speakers, their roles, and even the nuances of their interactions, including emotions, sentiment, and speaking styles,” Soniox said. The startup says its model is “on par” with OpenAI’s GPT-4o and other language models on benchmarks for text. The company was co-founded by Ambroz Bizjak and Klemen Simonic, formerly of Meta. Xscape Photonics, a startup using silicon photonics in data centers, announced a $44 million Series A funding round this week, which included investors such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Cisco (CSCO). The startup plans to use the funding to accelerate development of its ChromX platform, which is used for AI data center fabrics. “Historically, performance and scalability challenges have been addressed by building bigger data centers to train large language models,” Vivek Raghunathan, co-founder and chief executive of Xscape Photonics, said in a statement, adding that the process is unsustainable and leads to issues with cost and energy consumption. “At Xscape Photonics, we are on a mission to help our customers completely reimagine how they solve these challenges,” Raghunathan said. “This funding validates our mission and positions us for future growth to support next-generation AI data centers.” Boston Dynamics (HYMTF) announced a research partnership with Toyota Research Institute (TM) this week to use the institute’s large behavior models to accelerate development of its general-purpose humanoid robots. The robotics company also plans to use its electric Atlas robot to accelerate the humanoids. “There has never been a more exciting time for the robotics industry, and we look forward to working with TRI to accelerate the development of general-purpose humanoids,” Robert Playter, chief executive of Boston Dynamics, said in a statement. “This partnership is an example of two companies with a strong research-and-development foundation coming together to work on many complex challenges and build useful robots that solve real-world problems.” Tako, an AI search engine that visualizes information, announced a $5.75 million seed funding round this week. The startup uses the “world’s most authoritative data sources” to generate visuals that provide factual, up-to-date information, it said. With the funding, Tako aims to expand its tech’s capabilities, as well as “further its mission to combat misinformation and false narratives [...]” “Tako grounds research and storytelling in reality by turning real-time, authoritative data into visual representations of knowledge,” Alex Rosenberg, co-founder and chief executive of Tako, said. “We’re making it easier than ever to access and share reliable information. We’ll use this funding to accelerate our plan to index all the world’s authoritative data and push the boundaries of how factual information can be visualized and persuasively shared.” The startup was integrated into Perplexity’s search engine in May. Articul8, a software company focused on generative AI for enterprises, announced a collaboration with Amazon Web Services to help customers building on the AWS platform develop and deploy their generative AI applications faster. The software company provides a full-stack generative AI platform that helps developers build, deploy, and manage enterprise-grade applications. “Generative AI has the potential to transform entire industries, but its cost, complexity of deployment, and the required expertise around this emerging technology can be intimidating to customers,” Alan Braun, director of technology partnerships at AWS, said. “This Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Articul8 will expand their ability to provide solutions that enable customers to build and deploy enterprise-grade Generative AI applications on AWS and help customers achieve meaningful business outcomes at scale.”

Investing.com -- It was another busy week of market moves. Given earnings season is underway, we can expect it to get even more hectic. Here are Investing.com's stocks of the week: Netflix shares surged on Friday. At the time of writing, it is up more than 9% for the day. The move is, of course, in response to the streaming giant’s latest earnings release, which saw it report Q3 EPS of $5.40, $0.28 better than the analyst estimate of $5.12. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter came in at $9.82 billion, above the consensus estimate of $9.77 billion. The company added 5.07 million subscribers during its third quarter versus 8.76 million net new subscribers in the year-ago period. However, the figure topped Wall Street estimates, helping send shares higher in early US trading. Furthermore, Netflix’s Q4 EPS guide of $4.23 topped the consensus of $3.90, with revenue expected to be $10.13 billion, above the consensus of $10 billion. Following the earnings release, analysts at Piper Sandler said Netflix stock is set up for “another strong year.” Taiwan Semi was another big mover this week. Early on Thursday, the company reported strong earnings and guidance, which resulted in a more than 9% rise. The company’s shares gained over 7% in the week. The semiconductor firm reported Q3 EPS of $1.94, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $1.79, while revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 billion versus the consensus estimate of $23.3 billion. Taiwan Semi sees Q4 2024 revenue between $26.1-26.9 billion, above the consensus of $24.9 billion. Other chip stocks also rose on the back of the company’s earnings. For example, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) tapped a new all-time high in intra-day trading Thursday, with TSM stating in its earnings call that AI demand is “real.” Following the earnings release, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock to NT$1,400 “to reflect TSMC’s stronger 3Q results/4Q guidance, better AI strength, and solid industry leadership.” Nuclear stocks have staged a strong rally in recent weeks. The bullish run began in late September after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a landmark purchase power agreement with Constellation Energy to supply nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers. This week, it was announced that Kairos Power and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have signed a Master Plant Development Agreement to create a path to deploy a U.S. fleet of advanced nuclear power projects totaling 500 MW by 2035. Then two days later, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the latest tech giant to buy into nuclear power after revealing it has signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects—including enabling the construction of several new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). One of those agreements with Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. The news surrounding nuclear has resulted in a boost for stocks in the sector. Here are just some of the big nuclear stock movers in the last week: While LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:LVMH) shares have managed to regain most of their losses, the stock fell sharply on Wednesday after the luxury group posted a 3% slide in third-quarter sales. The company said its third-quarter sales decline arose primarily “from lower growth seen in Japan, essentially due to the stronger yen.” The company also noted that “Hennessy cognac was held back by weak local demand in the Chinese market.” Despite the headwinds, analysts at Stifel believe an improvement for the company could arrive in H2 2025, driven by stimulus measures in China and a recovery in consumer sentiment. ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) was one semiconductor stock that took a hit this week. On Tuesday, it declined over 15% as its latest earnings release disappointed investors. Following the report, which seemed to be released a day early in error, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the price target to EUR 750 from EUR1,000, removing it as a top pick. The firm did, however, maintain an Overweight rating on ASML. “This Q was obviously a disaster given order weakness and cut to the company’s CY25 outlook,” said the firm. “Near term, we view a likely bottom as €600 (25x new mid-point of 2025 target model) — and with shares at €633, we think the sell-off is mostly done. As for positive catalysts, it will take some time.”

Title: ‘Pointless meetings, middling middle managers’: Amazon employees air workplace complaints in viral LinkedIn post

Employee frustrations with Amazon’s culture, usually confined to internal forums, spilled into the public eye this week through a viral LinkedIn post that struck a chord with many current and former employees. Stephanie Ramos, a former Amazon employee, criticised the company’s growing bureaucracy in her post. "Instead of the exciting, fast-paced environment I remember, I experienced a place bogged down in pointless meetings and middling middle managers,” Ramos wrote, explaining why she quit just three months after being rehired. The post, shared on Monday, quickly gained traction. By the end of the week, it had attracted over 100,000 views and more than 200 comments. Around 20 commenters identified as current Amazon employees from various departments, many expressing similar frustrations. Some criticisms were directed at CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021. “Love him or hate him, Bezos had courage and a vision — he had real all-hands meetings that weren’t prerecorded with hard questions,” wrote Todd Leonhardt, an Amazon Web Services developer based in Virginia. Laura Barry, a nearly 20-year Amazon employee, compared the current work environment to that of a bank, citing the new policy requiring employees to return to the office five days a week. “I’m waiting for a dress code to be implemented after 5 days a week starts,” she joked. “Hide those tattoos!," as quoted by Bloomberg. While employee gripes are common at large companies, the public nature of this week’s LinkedIn discussions stood out. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan declined to comment on specific criticisms but noted that Amazon placed second in LinkedIn’s 2024 Top Companies list, trailing JPMorgan Chase, as per a report by Bloomberg. Jassy’s leadership has been marked by cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, which have pleased investors but upset some employees. In a September memo, Jassy himself criticized the company’s structure, saying that additional management layers had slowed progress. He argued that the five-day office return policy, starting in January 2024, would help restore Amazon’s fast-paced culture, the report added. Most employee backlash to the return-to-office mandate had previously remained on anonymous platforms like Blind. Ramos, however, decided to go public. Ramos, who worked at Amazon for six years before being laid off in 2023, was rehired earlier this year but left after finding the culture frustrating. Although she didn’t oppose the return-to-office requirement, the internal environment made her decide to quit, as per the report. Initially hesitant to post her thoughts, Ramos said she felt relieved when others responded to her post. "I’m not alone,” she said.

Title: Decoding Netflix Inc (NFLX): A Strategic SWOT Insight
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-netflix-inc-nflx-strategic-050158579.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T05:01:58Z

Netflix Inc showcases robust subscriber growth and revenue expansion. Strategic ad-supported plans introduced to tap into new revenue streams. Comprehensive SWOT analysis reveals key strengths and potential risks. Financial data indicates solid net income growth amidst competitive market. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), the leading streaming service provider, recently released its 10-Q filing on October 18, 2024, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial performance and strategic positioning. With a subscriber base surpassing 275 million globally, Netflix Inc has demonstrated significant growth, particularly in its net income, which rose to $2.36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.68 million for the same period in the previous year. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions. Global Subscriber Dominance: Netflix Inc's strength lies in its massive subscriber base, which is the largest among television entertainment providers worldwide. The company's consistent focus on expanding its content library with diverse genres and languages has contributed to its global appeal. This strategy has not only solidified its market dominance but also provided a substantial recurring revenue stream, as evidenced by the impressive growth in net income reported in the recent 10-Q filing. Financial Resilience: The financial tables from the 10-Q filing underscore Netflix Inc's robust financial health. The company's strong balance sheet is reflected in its increased net income and comprehensive income, indicating a resilient financial position that supports strategic investments and content development. This financial resilience provides Netflix Inc with the flexibility to navigate market fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities. Content Amortization Costs: Despite its financial strengths, Netflix Inc faces challenges with the high costs associated with content amortization. As the company invests heavily in acquiring, licensing, and producing content to maintain its competitive edge, these costs significantly impact its cost of revenues. The 10-Q filing reveals a $126 million increase in content amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous year, highlighting the need for efficient content cost management. Foreign Currency Exchange Risks: Netflix Inc's international presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange risks, which can affect its revenue and earnings. The 10-Q filing indicates that the company utilizes derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage these risks. However, the complexities of global financial markets mean that Netflix Inc must continuously refine its hedging strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts on its financial performance. Ad-Supported Subscription Plans: The introduction of ad-supported subscription plans represents a significant opportunity for Netflix Inc to diversify its revenue streams. By tapping into the advertising market, the company can attract a broader audience base, particularly price-sensitive consumers, and generate additional income. This strategic move, as highlighted in the company description, aligns with industry trends and opens up new growth avenues for Netflix Inc. Content Innovation: Netflix Inc's commitment to content innovation presents opportunities to capture emerging market segments and trends. The company's investment in original programming, documentaries, and international content has the potential to attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. By continuously evolving its content offerings, Netflix Inc can maintain its market leadership and drive long-term subscriber growth. Intensifying Competition: The streaming industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Companies like Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max are investing heavily in content and marketing, posing a threat to Netflix Inc's subscriber growth and retention. The 10-Q filing emphasizes the need for Netflix Inc to innovate and differentiate its service to stay ahead of the competition. Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Netflix Inc operates in a complex global regulatory environment, which can pose legal and compliance challenges. The company's expansion into new markets may be hindered by local regulations, content restrictions, and tax obligations. As indicated in the 10-Q filing, legal proceedings and non-income tax audits, particularly in jurisdictions like Brazil, could have material impacts on Netflix Inc's operations and financial position. In conclusion, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) displays a strong financial and strategic position, with a dominant global subscriber base and a solid balance sheet. However, the company must navigate the challenges of high content amortization costs and foreign currency exchange risks. Opportunities for growth lie in the newly introduced ad-supported plans and ongoing content innovation. Nevertheless, Netflix Inc must remain vigilant against the threats of intensifying competition and regulatory complexities. This SWOT analysis provides investors with a nuanced understanding of Netflix Inc's potential to sustain its leadership in the streaming industry while highlighting areas for strategic focus.

This is this week’s ForbesWomen newsletter, which every Thursday brings news about the world’s top female entrepreneurs, leaders and investors straight to your inbox. Click here to get on the newsletter list! US President Barack Obama applauds Lilly Ledbetter before signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, January 29, 2009. The wage discrimination bill, which allows employees more time to file a claim, is named after Lilly Ledbetter, a retired worker at a Goodyear factory in Alabama who discovered she was paid less than her male counterparts. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) On Saturday, groundbreaking pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter passed away at the age of 86. Ledbetter never set out to be an activist—she was a factory worker in Alabama who just wanted to do her job and get paid fairly for doing it. But after an anonymous note informed Ledbetter that she was being paid significantly less than all 15 of her male colleagues, including those with less seniority, Ledbetter set out on a path that would ultimately lead to a change in American law. “It’s important to remember that she was a manager in a tire plant in Alabama in the 80s. She was a force in the workplace, a woman ahead of her time,” Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, told me in an interview this week. While it’s hard to calculate the exact number of people who’ve benefited from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act—which President Obama signed in his first act as commander in chief in 2009—Farrell says that Ledbetter’s work touches tens of thousands of pay discrimination cases every year. However, as entrepreneur LIz Elting notes in her remembrance of Ledbetter for ForbesWomen, the future Ledbetter fought for may still be on uncertain ground, with recent research from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) estimating that the gender pay gap may never close. “So many women, this writer included, have Ledbetter to thank for igniting this fight so that we can one day make that future a reality,” Elting says. “In her own words, ‘This fight, which began as my own, is now our fight.’” Cheers to that! P.S.: Nominations for the 4th annual 50 Over 50 Global list are now open! This year’s global list is different from the ones we’ve run in the past, because it is truly global: instead of doing two regional lists in Asia and EMEA, we’re seeking nominations from all continents and countries (other than the U.S.). You see all the nomination details here and a Know Your Value segment about the list here. Getty Images Startups across the reproductive healthcare space have seen their ads about in-vitro fertilization and egg-freezing blocked or restricted across TikTok, Google and Meta, according to leaders of multiple reproductive health companies. “We are literally hitting our heads against a brick wall,” said Dr. Helen O’Neill, a Hertility cofounder and molecular geneticist who’s spent more than a decade researching infertility and embryonic development. GLENDALE, ARIZONA - MARCH 17: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY. NO USE ON COVERS OF PUBLICATIONS. NO BOOK USE) Taylor Swift performs onstage for the opening night of "Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour" at State Farm Stadium on March 17, 2023 in Swift City, ERAzona (Glendale, Arizona). The city of Glendale, Arizona was ceremonially renamed to Swift City for March 17-18 in honor of The Eras Tour. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management) In 2024, concert tickets hit the highest average price ever recorded, at nearly $127 a seat. But who are the artists who’ve had the highest grossing concerts of the year so far? Taylor Swift, P!nk and Madonna are among the top 10, according to a new Forbes analysis. Three years after reaching a confidential divorce settlement with Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates is still receiving Microsoft stock from her former spouse. Last Tuesday, French Gates reported receiving an additional $1.2 billion of public company stock, boosting her fortune to an estimated $30.2 billion and ranking her the 12th richest woman in the world. The Federal Trade Commission will soon implement a rule making it easier for consumers to cancel their subscriptions and memberships, effectively clamping down on companies who complicate the cancellation process and threatening them with civil penalties if they continue to do so. "Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription," FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement Wednesday. Vice President Kamala Harris rolled out new economic proposals Monday aimed at Black men, adding to the economic plans she’s already released as the nominee has already called for an “opportunity economy” focused on the middle class and released proposals that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. There’s a common stereotype in the modern working world that women are less confident than men. It’s sometimes used to excuse gender and pay disparities at the leadership level. But new research suggests that the opposite is true: in 2024, female business leaders are significantly more confident that they have the right skills to be successful at work than their male counterparts. 1. Watch your language. Are the words you use on your resume holding you back? According to new research, “communal” verbiage that indicates relationship-oriented strengths can backfire for women who are applying for roles in traditionally male-dominated fields. 2. “Dry trip” it. As many as 41% of Americans—and more than half of millennials and Gen Zers—are trying to drink less, a significant uptick from even just a few years ago. One area where this trend breaks down, though, is vacation. Meet the entrepreneur trying to bring more spirit-free options to the travel industry. 3. Recover from a business-partner breakup. The emotional (and logistical) turmoil of losing a business partner can mirror the grief cycle we experience for personal losses. Recognizing and managing these stages is crucial to maintaining your venture’s momentum and well-being. An NWSL expansion team is set to bring pro women’s soccer back to Boston for the first time since 2017. But even though its players won’t step onto the pitch until 2026, the team’s debut this week drew immediate criticism. What does the controversy stem from? Check your answer. One Community.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher on the final day of a trading week that included a series of earnings reports from key companies. After major financial firms disclosed mostly upbeat results earlier in the week, Netflix (NFLX) took the spotlight with a strong report that could be a positive signal for the tech and communications giants set to report in the coming weeks. On Friday, the S&P 500 added 0.4% to notch an all-time closing high. The Dow reversed morning losses to end the session nearly 0.1% higher, extending its streak of record closes to three. The Nasdaq was up 0.6%. Netflix shares scored the S&P 500's top daily performance, soaring 11.1% to an all-time high following the video-streaming giant's better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. Although the pace of subscriber additions slowed from the preceding quarters, 14% growth in total active subscribers was enough to edge out estimates. Analysts have indicated that the company's crackdown on password-sharing has helped boost subscriber numbers, but Netflix plans to discontinue the public release of subscriber data starting in 2025. Shares of Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) surged 10.2% after a securities filing confirmed reports that activist investor Jana Partners has acquired a stake of around 5% in the food processing company. Jana reportedly intends to encourage the maker of frozen french fries to consider the possibility of a sale as well as push for changes to its operations and capital allocation strategy. An upbeat earnings report also helped lift shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which jumped 10% after the provider of robotic-assisted systems for minimally invasive medical procedures topped quarterly sales and profit estimates. The company disclosed an 18% uptick in the number of procedures performed using its da Vinci surgical system. In the wake of the strong results, analysts at Piper Sandler lifted their price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to $538 from $495. Agricultural stocks moved lower after Raymond James downgraded Canada-based grain processor Ag Growth International (AGGZF) to "market perform." Analysts said soft crop prices and weak sentiment among farmers amounted to significant headwinds for the global agricultural industry. Shares of fellow grain handler Bunge Global (BG) dropped 6.3%, the steepest decline in the S&P 500 Friday, while peer Archer-Daniels-Midland's (ADM) shares slide 3.8%. Ag Growth International's American depositary receipts (ADRs) were down 10.7%. CVS Health (CVS) shares tumbled 5.2% following the announcement that the pharmacy giant is replacing its chief executive officer (CEO). Company veteran David Joyner, most recently in charge of the firm's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Caremark, is stepping into the top role, effective immediately. CVS also issued a lower-than-expected outlook for its third-quarter profit. The company is set to release its next quarterly results before the opening bell on Nov. 6. SLB (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, reported mixed third-quarter results, topping profit expectations but falling short of revenue forecasts. The company, formerly known as Schlumberger, cautioned that depressed spending by oil producers in the context of a weak oil price environment could restrain its fourth-quarter revenue growth. SLB shares lost 4.7% on Friday.

ERIC KIM Ultimately when people study Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger etc ,,, what all these guys are searching for is wisdom. I think this is good and important because principles wisdom, is resistant to time and technology, but at least for myself, I was born in 1988, searching for practical wisdom has always remained elusive for me. I think difficult thing is that my circumstances were unique. I was born in the states, yet grew up poor; my definition of poor is not being sure whether you would be homeless next month because your dad just gambled away the rent money again, going off to Reno in the middle of the night. I think on two fronts this was useful to me: First, it taught me self independence at a very young age. I knew that if I wanted anything, I had to work for it. This motivated me to pick up lots of part-time jobs when I was like 13, 14 or 15, tutoring English, through my honors program at school, working at the local community center, getting a $200 a month stipend etc. ￼ In fact, my biggest personal pride and joy; essentially, purchasing my first car with my own money! At the age of 15, getting my drivers permit in California, $1000 or maybe $1200 1991 Sentra XE, 5 door sedan, 5 speed manual transmission car — it didn’t even have a tachometer! I learned how to shift gears simply by hearing and feeling the engine? This began my first love affair with manual transmission cars; In fact, another point of pride, every car I have purchased my own money has always been a used manual transmission car, never exceeding $2500 USD. In fact, the last car I purchased one in Providence Rhode Island before Seneca was born was a 2002 Subaru outback, five speed manual transmission, listed on craigslist for 1000 bucks, was able to negotiate down to $900, then $800 in cash! Lying out those eight $100 bills was the most obvious decision I’ve made in my life. ￼￼In terms of my decision-making philosophy, my unorthodox beliefs; obvious decisions are obvious. ￼ What that means is before making any sort of decision life decision etc., you don’t need to think about it too much. Obvious decisions are staring you right at the face, and whenever you have to hesitate before making a certain decision, don’t do it. Why? Your brain is still working out the details, whether or not you should do the thing or not. For example, buying microstrategy stock, MSTR, ￼￼to me is a 100% obvious decision. For the traditional markets, it’s literally the only asset worth purchasing. Why? Essentially they have discovered a free money hack or infinite money hack, which they could leverage their 30-year-old business, which is regulated, and mainstream… And leverage their position, borrowing money at less than one percent to buy bitcoin, which is accretive forever, and continuing the virtuous cycle. Bitcoin is cyber manhattan: 256^3￼ I think the idea of a cyber Manhattan, cyber real estate company is fascinating to me. And the difference between bitcoin, cyber real estate and Cyberman Manhattan is that it is actually backed by real electricity and power. For example, the problems with all these fake virtual worlds is that it is just powered by a computer code, one and zeros, Any nerd can click a button and create a skyscraper in Sim city. But what if, if you wanted to build a skyscraper in Sim city, you actually had to expand $1 billion of real capital in the real world, before transferring it and transporting it to cyberspace? This is the 1000% paradigm shift; The bridge between the physical, embodied reality, ￼ physical world and realm, to the digital cyber realm… Which is still backed with physical electricity? Or it’s a feature, not a bug? I think what a lot of these goody two shoers don’t get or understand is about real life physics in the game, skin in the game, energy in the game. Everyone wants some sort of hidden upside without any real life downside? I’ll give you example, everyone wants to rid the world of suffering pain injustice and the like. However, a life without suffering pain injustice and overcoming is not a life worth living. You cannot have happiness without pain and suffering, nor can you have joy with without sorrow and misery. If we think about this from a Taoist perspective, ￼I think about yin and Yang, you cannot have the good without the bad. You cannot have the virtuous without the evil. For example, obviously being in poor health sucks, and bad weather also sucks. But, when things get much better, you are 1000 times more joyful grateful and happy when things shift! This is why funny enough, I think people on the East Coast, New England, Providence Rhode Island are happier than people in LA because the weather shifts are more extreme. For example, when you’re suffering in the winter time for months on end, no sunshine whatever, and then boom, one day the sun comes out, everyone is overjoyed! It is still 55° and cold, but at least it is sunny; everyone runs out and gets their picnic blankets, And the joy of the sunlight is 1000 times more extreme than in Los Angeles where everyone is trying to hide from the sun, even though they love it? My simple analogy is everyone in LA is like a solid 7.2 out of 10, in terms of happiness, whereas in the East coast, your happiness goes from a -10 to a +500% when the weather is good! ￼ So I suppose, the philosophical question them becomes, is it better or more favorable to have a steady mediocre thing forever, or more extreme highs and lows, which will be a benefit to your happiness? Then a simple thought, the reason why I love bitcoin is because of the extremes; I would prefer an extreme life to a steady and boring one. ￼ I think for me my number one principle in investing ￼￼is yield. I think what a lot of people think is what they’re trying to do with their money is they are trying to securitize it, and make it safe, stored in really really safe assets like treasury bills, bonds, or “safe” investments like Apple Amazon Facebook Google and like. But, my personal thought is life should not be conservative; the point of life isn’t to just conserve your wealth, but rather, to grow it! Even the story of Jesus, you don’t just take your wealth and hide it and bury your talents, your gold talents in the ground because you’re afraid of losing it. No, the virtuous thing is to go out and multiply it! And I also think the same thing is with wealth; the virtuous calling is to multiply it to grow it, not to just bury it, with the fear that it might go down. OK, a lot of these fools, they want quick gains in order to go out and buy the Lamborghini or whatever. But once you find out that only small dick losers drive Lamborghinis, ￼ and also, that the useful lifetime value of a Lamborghini might only be three or four years, that is the point in which the maintenance costs and the insurance costs and fixing it up will destroy the price of it in just three or four years, then it becomes obvious; you wish the Lamborghini onto your worst enemy, you don’t desire one for yourself. ￼ My simple thought is take a stoic spartan approach; essentially live like a super super poor person, the only thing you should ever spend money on is weights barbells and weightlifting equipment, and meet… Everything else should be essentially free. This means, Essentially, the easiest way to become rich is not go broke.￼ So essentially, I’ve literally I think watch every single Michael Saylor interview that he’s ever done everything that he posted to Twitter or YouTube etc. Maybe about 100 of them. Anyways, probably the most fascinating thing that I’ve learned about the value of an asset is the value of an asset is essentially the cost of something or the value is something divided by the maintenance cost. Now I think this is something that people don’t really think about — ￼the maintenance cost. So for example, now that all of my millennial friends are growing up, I’m 36 now, in four years, I’m gonna be 40 years old, everyone’s trying to think about the future buying a single-family home or a condo or property or whatever. And what beguiles a lot of people or shocks people is when they buy a house, all the maintenance costs! Even talking to my friend Anton (congrats on your new kid!) he told me a story while we were in downtown LA about how he bought a house, but the water heater went out, and him having to fix it, and what a nightmare it was. Also simple things that we millennials never think about… You need a new roof and boom, that’s $50,000. That’s $50,000 I would rather put into bitcoin. There are so many things that exist on the planet, in real world, in embody reality which cost a premium in terms of insurance, maintenance, etc. Once again, almost nothing in the physical realm is ever worth it. ￼ If you want a new car, just download some racing game to your iPad, or even PlayStation or whatever; better to spend 50 bucks on a virtual car then drop $50,000 or more on a new one!￼ ￼ Or, just buy an oculus quest, play some racing game, at least this way you want to kill yourself, or another family in a car with two kids or more. –> The worst thing in life isn’t dying or killing yourself, but it is accidentally killing another family, accidentally killing kids in the car seat of another car, and you having to live with the guilt for the rest of your life. ￼￼ Bitcoin is not real, but, if it costs $800 billion to produce, it’s real! Let’s again, things must have a stake in the physical realm, if it doesn’t, it is just air coin, or the foundation is just built on cotton candy. I think we must avoid these fake environmentalists, a bunch of vegan losers. Essentially, if I psychoanalyze a lot of these fake environmentalists; essentially everyone is seeking a new religion, a new godhead which is the “environment“, but ultimately my critical thought is that once again it just comes down to money; For example, Al Gore, I wonder… How much money has he collected from doing his talks on an inconvenient truth, ultimately being funded by taxpayer money? And also, James Cameron, and also Arnold, how much money they have collected from the vegan pea protein powder plant factory, just follow the money. ￼ Much more profitable to sell a $50 container of vegan protein powder, than a meat company to sell beef rib or beef liver. ￼ Also a random aside; if you really wanted to be a real environmentalist, you would actually have a 100% organ meat diet, only beef heart beef liver beef kidneys and intestines, because these parts are typically thrown away. “Being naked is the ultimate sustainable option. We’re number two.” – Reformation marketing copy ￼ The truth is environmentalism is very profitable. For example a lot of these clothing companies, I think also like the new one “Reformation“, a female clothing company, they talk about sustainability and blah blah blah, but once again, is it just another marketing tactic to sell their mediocre clothes. For example, people talk that leather in animal products are evil blah blah blah. Yet the truth is, you’re cheap vegan leather jacket which is made out of petroleum is probably 1 trillion times worse for the planet than a fashionable one made out of 100% real leather. A pleather vegan jacket might only last you a few years, a good leather jacket can you last you 50 or beyond.￼ Because if you critically think about it, things which last, are better for the “environment”. And typically animal products last. I love leather!￼ Also nowadays, people talk about Native Americans and stuff like that, don’t you know that historically the way that natives lived off the land was in harmony with animals, like can you imagine a Native American who didn’t use animal power, ride on horses, or eat meat and bison? Besides maybe virtue signaling America, ￼there is no great civilization that has ever existed without animal products whether food labor etc. ￼ Once again I think the biggest issue is in today’s world, nobody likes risk anymore. Risk is seen as something which is dangerous bad and to be avoided. For example anybody who buys a Mercedes car an Audi, a Porsche a Lamborghini whatever… It is ultimately a risk free option in the sense that no one’s gonna make fun of you for owning those type of cars. So in some ways it is a cowardly act; For example everyone thinks a Porsche 911 is cool, a Lamborghini is cool, a Mercedes or an Audi is cool. Yet ￼ maybe I’m the only one with the big dick in the room, I brag that I drive a Toyota Prius? Everyone is always so shocked and impressed. Real investors and economists must and should drive a Prius! OK, whenever I discover anybody who’s a professor, who teaches in a business school, is an economist, academic or scholar or whatever… Yet just puts all of their money in a boring mutual fund… Or index fund… It is a signal that they are not a real economist, and they are actually not really connected to reality. We need some sort of risk exposure to the real world. For example, easy to be the typical fat American who is drinking beer or wine watching sports and American football, giving their opinion on sports teams and players yet they are not actually exposed to the risk of playing real tackle football? And once again… The more I think about it the more bizarre it is. To watch UFC or mixed martial arts, to watch any sport that you have not yourself played… It kind of like mental masturbation? To sports? Sports is masculine physical sports masturbation pornography? Just think about it the average person eats nachos french fries drink beer or alcohol smoke marijuana before watching the big game. But what a athlete who is actually participating in the sport down a beer really quick before putting on their armor and hitting the field? Obviously not! So why is it that alcohol food beverages is marketed to these individuals, for watching a sport? It is the new risk free premium hedonism; the joy of seeing people get murdered on a field, or in our arena without any real exposure. People are always so surprised that I played real football real American tackle football in high school, they are shocked to hear that I was linebacker, first outside linebacker then inside linebacker. ￼ I think it is actually racism; you never expect an Asian guy to play linebacker because we are not seen as masculine or aggressive enough. But if I were African-American or black, even though I am on the more lean side — you probably would not be shocked, because in America, athletes are always seen as being African-American, never Asian. Even an Asian professional sports athlete is almost seen as a glitch in the system, not the real deal. Even when first deadlifted 465 pounds, sumo style off the floor, and everyone was so shocked, I was talking to my friend Jemal and I asked him — “If I was African-American or black, but people will be asshocked or surprised?” He laughed and said no! So I think the first thing you have to think philosophically is what are you really searching for, and why? My very simple thought is think 300 years ahead, your kids kids kids. The current lifestyle is like the Persian slave lifestyle?￼ I think the issue we are facing today in today’s world is hedonism — the new hedonism. We seek companionship through humans or dogs, yet we don’t want to have children, we want to preserve our freedom travel the world go to Japan eat good sushi whatever. But, your dog cannot inherit your bitcoin. ￼￼ I think maybe in the past life was actually easier and more straightforward people. You got married, you built up a family legacy and empire; this was actually a pretty good strategy in life. And I think people were actually much happier, productive, and joyful! Think about all the modern day melodies of depression anxiety whatever, they are all modern day sociological ills. In fact, the ancient Greeks, thinking about the Iliad; certainly things are natural like courage, cowardice, and fear… But depression anxiety was not. My sociological theory on why so many people are so depressed and anxious is because of YouTube, Spotify, podcast, TikTok Facebook Instagram, Twitter, news, fear porn. ￼ Have a theory; a lot of people are secretly waiting and twiddling their thumbs, they actually want to see the world burn to the floor, to be able to have the indignant feeling; “I told you… I was right all along!” For example, all these people, are during Covid and pre-Covid and post Covid whatever, thought that there was gonna be food riots and blah blah blah, none of it happened. Humans are 1 trillion times more resilient than we make them out to be. ￼This is where also, philosophically I don’t really believe in short selling; even if you could cop a massive profit. For example there are certain things that I am certain which will go down to zero, like Ada Cardano and the like because it is fake. But rather than hoping that something is going to burn the floor, better to just bet on things that you think that will go to Mars! ￼ For example, everyone hates Elon Musk, and they are secretly waiting and plotting for him to fail. Yet doesn’t it take more courage to wish and hope and desire to see people succeed? Even I remember the Tesla model 3; everyone thought it would be impossible, but now, it is certainly the new Ford model T; the coolest, most desirable, most futuristic and affordable car on the road. I personally plan on driving my Toyota Prius until it dies at 1,000,000 miles, but if for one reason or another I was forced to purchase a brand new car, it would definitely be a Tesla, maybe the robotaxi? The reason why I encourage everyone to watch the Robo taxi, Robo van announcement is that it is the ultimate disruptor. For example, the Robo van, the two door coupe, insanely awesome design, with the butterfly McLaren doors… I find like there is no more reason to ever even want to buy a loser Lamborghini, or McLaren or whatever. And I really really love that rose gold, MATTE Rose gold Color on the Robo taxi, and also the rims look awesome! Once again, assuming that you’re a futurist like myself, the trillion dollar questions “why doesn’t the future actually look like the future?“ For example, if you really do believe in the digital transformation of things, like you care about Apple Tesla Amazon Facebook digital media whatever… Why would you ever buy analog property like a single-family home or whatever? Wouldn’t you prefer to buy digital property which is bitcoin? And also, issues with tax, property tax. Also assuming that you’re a libertarian, or some sort of anti-government person, bitcoin makes sense because it is like digital or cyber real estate that can’t be taxed! And I think the truth is that real rich people, know how to do tax deferment, or to avoid taxes, this is a real reason they become and stay rich. “My accountant so good I’m practically living tax-free!” – JAY Z￼￼￼ For example, even if you live in the lowest tax jurisdiction place which is Florida, and nobody wants to live in Florida, still… Under a base case scenario you’re still playing at least 1.1% in taxes. And that means then, the life of your asset is only 70 years; within 70 years Assuming you buy a $1 million property, you’re gonna pay $1 million in taxes in 70 years. Then, if you own a single-family home or whatever, or property the coal is actually trying to rent out your property at a premium, but two people who have never really had experience with property property management… It is a fucking nightmare and headache. Finding good tenants and keeping them; the holy Grail. Too much counterparty risk with properties; people who fuck up your property, end up not paying rent in squatting your place, people who start to grow marijuana inside your property, people who turn your property into a brothel (true story), or just physical wear and tear and decay. Anything in the physical realm in my opinion has too much risk. ￼And this is where still… In my eyes, Tesla is too much of a risk. Why? Having to build all those cyber trucks, Robo taxis, is just in my opinion, too much of a gargantuan physical task. Even if you automate the whole thing with robots, still, extracting lithium from the Earth, making the cars, delivering the cars, my personal estimate is you won’t see Robo taxis on the road for at least another five or seven years? To me that is too long. I think the best investment is something that you have a 100% certainty will go up in 30 years, and you just ignore the volatility and the noise on a day-to-day level. Yes especially if it is digital!￼ Also the funny thing is; bitcoin was the classic the first only immaculate conception; technically Ethereum from Vitalik was just a bitcoin copycat.￼ My very very basic suggestion is just download Coinbase to your phone, buy bitcoin from your traditional bank account, and once you’re done buying it, delete the Coinbase app from your phone, and never check prices. And what you doing instead it’s just go to michael.com, watch all the Michael sailor interviews, and read books on economic theory philosophy etc. I personally believe that the best wisdom is in the past; read Aristotle on economics, Fernandinho Galiani on money Della moneta, the principles of economic theory from Karl Menger etc. you should be able to find free PDFs of all these online, just read it on your iPad. ￼*** You buy the bitcoin, and you never sell it, just keep buying it until you die, and the idea is just give it to your kids kids kids. And you’re a supreme happiness and joy is through weightlifting, one red maxing, and seeing the numbers go up! ￼ My suggestion is never ever ever sell the bitcoin, for anything. If you need spare cash for living or whatever, better to borrow the money at 7% interest or lower, assuming that bitcoin is going to go up 21% year over a year, compounded rate forever. ￼ I would say only by microstrategy MSTR if you just cannot get access to capital to buy bitcoin directly. At the end of your life, he or she with the most bitcoin is going to be the winner. Or the corporate entity like micro strategy, who owns the most bitcoin. The goal is a Nakamoto, which is the mythical 1 million bitcoins. The same amount of bitcoins in Satoshi‘s wallet, which he hasn’t touched. ￼￼This is currently $60 billion! ￼ honestly because I live like a poor person, for me, at this point investing is just a new passion, almost like a new hobby. Still for me my critical passion is photography, blogging and like. ￼So the simple thought; know that investing in money is a means to an end not the in itself.

Title: Nvidia Can Approach $5 Trillion Valuation With ‘Generational’ AI Opportunity Still Ahead, BofA Says

Nvidia stock has much more room to run up its all-time high share price set this week, argue Bank of America analysts, who just meaningfully upped their price target for the artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia due to a highly favorable growth horizon. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang The Bank of America group led by Vivek Arya raised their Nvidia target from $165 to $190, indicating 37% upside from Nvidia’s $138 share price Friday, a fresh weekly closing high. Arya and company argued a “generational opportunity” is still ahead for Nvidia in AI accelerators, the full-stack semiconductor systems necessary for generative AI applications of which Nvidia captures roughly 80% of the market as its big-ticket customers like Alphabet, Meta and OpenAI invest heavily in Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to train large-language models. Bank of America projects the total addressable market for this AI technology will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year to $363 billion by year’s end, while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, translating to a whopping $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. For reference, Apple generated $204 billion of revenue from iPhones in 2023. Other positive catalysts named by Bank of America include significantly higher profit margins than its peers, with its free cash flow margin of roughly 50% over the next two years forecasted at twice as much as the average of the other five trillion-dollar American technology giants, and its “underappreciated” income streams outside of selling its custom GPUs, including lucrative partnerships with consultancy Accenture and Microsoft. $4.7 trillion. That’s the Nvidia market capitalization implied by Bank of America analysts’ $190 price target. That’s much higher than the market value of any public company ever, a title held by Apple at $3.6 trillion. Nvidia is the world’s second-most valuable company with a $3.4 trillion market cap. That’s a far cry from the roughly $10 billion valuation it held a decade ago and the sub-$300 billion market cap it boasted just two years ago. Nvidia’s stock market ascension followed the late 2022 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, which inspired significant earnings growth for the company as Nvidia’s graphics processing units are at the core of these AI applications. Nvidia’s sales and net income were 350% and 2,400% higher during the quarter ending in July than they were during 2022’s comparable period, respectively. Originally a company known for its role in video game graphics, Nvidia is still led by its founding CEO Jensen Huang, who is the 11th-richest person in the world thanks to his 3% stake in the company, according to Forbes’ calculations. Common valuation metrics indicate Nvidia stock is expensive relative to its fundamentals – it has the second-highest price-to-sales ratio, which compares a company’s market cap to its last 12-month revenues, on the S&P 500, but many remain bullish thanks to what Huang describes as “emotional” and “insane demand for Nvidia’s products.

Title: Campbell PD receives FAA nod for 24/7 drone operations
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/campbell-pd-receives-faa-nod-for-247-drone-operations-93CH-3671562

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - In a significant development for public safety technology, the Campbell Police Department has been granted a waiver by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone operations both during the day and at night. This waiver, a first of its kind to include nighttime flights, allows the department to utilize Dedrone by Axon's advanced DedroneBeyond technology without the need for visual observers. The Drone as a First Responder (DFR) program by the Campbell Police Department, which began in 2022, has been pivotal in improving emergency response by providing immediate aerial insights upon receiving 911 calls. The FAA's recent approval under part 91.113(b) enhances the program by permitting the use of DedroneBeyond's ground-based detect and avoid system, thus enabling round-the-clock drone operations. The DedroneBeyond system acts as a virtual visual observer, allowing remote pilots to manage drones from a control center and swiftly respond to incidents, reaching altitudes up to 400 feet. The AI-driven technology ensures safe operation by accurately detecting and avoiding manned aircraft without compromising the mission through false alarms. Chief Gary Berg of the Campbell Police Department emphasized the significance of this approval, stating that it would allow for quicker and more efficient emergency responses, ultimately bolstering both officer and public safety. Aaditya Devarakonda, CEO of Dedrone by Axon, echoed the sentiment, highlighting the transformative nature of the FAA's decision for law enforcement across the nation. The DFR program in Campbell incorporates technology from industry leaders such as Axon Air Remote powered by DroneSense and MatrixSpace, providing drone operators with a comprehensive view for airspace management and mission control. Axon, recognized as a global leader in public safety technologies, is set to exhibit its latest innovations, including DFR solutions, at the upcoming IACP Annual Conference in Boston. This news is based on a press release statement, which outlines the collaboration between Axon and the Campbell Police Department in advancing public safety through innovative technology. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) has been making significant strides in its financial performance and innovation. The company reported record-breaking earnings in the second quarter, with revenue surpassing $500 million and new business bookings exceeding $1 billion. This robust growth was driven by new products, TASER 10 and Axon Body 4, and a shift in revenue mix, with software and services accounting for 39% of total revenue. Baird, an independent global financial services firm, has maintained its Outperform rating on Axon while raising the stock's price target. This decision reflects their confidence in Axon's continued expansion and innovation, highlighting the potential for new artificial intelligence capabilities to act as a catalyst for the company's growth. Axon's software segment has shown impressive growth, with a 47% year-over-year increase in the second quarter, now approaching an annualized revenue of nearly $800 million. The company's future contracted revenue stands at approximately $7.4 billion, and full-year revenue guidance has been raised to between $2 billion and $2.05 billion. Adjusted EBITDA reached $123 million, with a margin of 24.5% for the quarter. Despite these positive developments, Axon executives have expressed cautiousness regarding potential economic downturns.

Title: Jeff Shultz, Paramount’s Streaming Strategy Chief, Is Exiting

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Jeff Shultz, who has served as chief strategy officer and chief business development officer of Paramount Global‘s streaming division, is leaving the company at the end of the year. Shultz joined Paramount in 2019 as part of the acquisition of Pluto TV and was a key executive on the leadership team that launched and grew the Paramount+ subscription service. He has overseen strategy, distribution and business development for both Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Shultz announced that he will leave Paramount Global in a post Friday on LinkedIn. “To my colleagues at Paramount Streaming, writing this incredible story with you has been the honor of my career,” he wrote. “I’m sorry I won’t be with you for the next chapter, but I can’t wait to see where you go from here.” Related Stories VIP+ Apple Deal Is Just a Piece of Amazon’s Streaming Marketplace Strategy Ryan Murphy Hulu Legal Drama 'All's Fair' Casts Ed O'Neill Paramount is expanding the role of Ray Hopkins, president of U.S. networks distribution, to now include streaming and linear partners/distribution, the company’s three co-CEOs — George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — announced in an internal memo Friday. As a result of this shift, Shultz “will be departing the organization and the Streaming [distribution and business development] team will now transition under Ray,” the execs said in the memo. Popular on Variety In July, Paramount Global and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone clinched a deal to merge Paramount with Skydance Media, a transaction expected to close in the first half of 2025. In the meantime, Paramount has engaged in layoffs and restructuring in its U.S. workforce aimed at slashing 15% of its domestic headcount. Separately Friday, Paramount disclosed that Charles Phillips Jr., who led the board’s special committee on M&A that ultimately reached a deal to merge the company with Skydance, is exiting the board of directors. Shultz joined Pluto TV as chief business officer in early 2018, after serving as an adviser to the free, ad-supported streaming startup for three years. A year later, Viacom acquired the free, ad-supported streaming startup for $340 million. Tom Ryan, former CEO of Pluto TV, is now CEO of Paramount Streaming. Ryan, in a comment on Shultz’s LinkedIn post, said: “Jeff, thank you for everything you have done for Paramount Streaming. Pluto TV and Paramount+ would never have come so far so fast without your talent, drive, optimism and collaboration. We will be forever grateful for your immense contributions and you will be sorely missed.” “Six and a half years ago, celebrating the acquisition of Pluto TV by Viacom with the team in Santa Barbara, I gave a toast recognizing the moment that concluded: ‘We’re just getting started,'” Shultz wrote in the LinkedIn post. “Despite all we have accomplished since then, I still feel the same way. So with mixed emotions I share that I will be leaving Paramount later this year.” Shultz touted deals that he cut for Pluto TV’s service, including with the NFL, Major League Baseball, Warner Bros. Discovery, A+E Networks, AMC Networks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lionsgate, MGM, Fremantle and Banijay Entertainment. Under his leadership, Pluto TV also inked partnership deals with Amazon, Roku, Google, Apple, T-Mobile, Verizon, Comcast, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Vizio and more. In 2019, the year Viacom acquired Pluto TV, the free streamer generated about $70 million in revenue; three years later, “Pluto TV was a billion-dollar business,” according to Shultz. In 2021, the company rebranded CBS All Access as Paramount+ to create the Paramount Streaming division. In the second quarter of 2024, the division reported revenue of $1.9 billion, representing one-fourth of Paramount Global revenue. Prior to Pluto TV, Shultz held senior leadership roles in digital business development at media companies including NBC and CBS, and internet TV startups Clicker and Concert TV, which he co-founded. In 2022, Shultz was named to Variety’s Dealmaker Impact Report. He began his career as a lawyer for Linklaters in London after earning a law degree from Georgetown University. In his LinkedIn post, Shultz said he was “deeply grateful for the leadership and friendship of Tom Ryan, and the partnership and excellence of the Paramount Streaming leadership team Elizabeth Wright, Domenic DiMeglio, Jeff Grossman, Amy Kuessner, Olivier Jollet, Marco Nobili, Erin Calhoun, and Abhinav Chopra.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Nvidia stock has another 38% upside amid a 'generational opportunity' in AI, Bank of America says

Nvidia stock has been on a tear all year, but investors can brace for even more gains ahead, Bank of America analysts say. In a Thursday note, the analysts raised their price objective on the stock from $165 to $190. That implies a 38% upside from its price of about $138 a share at midday on Friday. The analysts point to exponential growth in the AI market in the coming years, which they say will give Nvidia a "generational opportunity" as the chip titan continues to strengthen its lead in the market. The analysts see the AI accelerator market growing to $280 billion by 2027, and toward upwards of $400 billion over time — marking huge growth from $45 billion in 2023. As AI models continue to grow rapidly—with developers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta launching new large language models several times per year—the need for computing will only grow, the analysts predict. Each new major LLM generation, especially those developed for larger size and better reasoning capabilities, will require greater training intensity, they add. "We continue to see the pace of new model development increase. LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity," the analysts said. They also point to Nvidia's strong partnerships with enterprise customers like Accenture, ServiceNow, Oracle, and others, which show the growing presence of AI at big companies and Nvidia's role as partner of choice. "​​NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side," the analysts said. The analysts also said Nvidia's financials are set up well for future gains. Given its free cash flow generation at 45%-50% margins, which is nearly double that of other Magnificent 7 stocks, Nvidia will be able to generate $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, they wrote. Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed this year, up 187% as AI continues to boom after a brief sell-off over the summer. The sector has since recovered, with chip stocks like Nvidia and TSMC trading at or near all-time highs in recent weeks. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Utilities outperform the broader markets amid enthusiasm over AI electricity demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Utilities have been on fire this year as enthusiasm over booming AI electricity demand pushes the sector higher. Case in point: The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up a whopping 29% so far this year — the best-performing sector to date, compared to the broader index's 23% rise. Much of the gains stem from enthusiasm over power producers that stand to benefit from the electrification boom — which includes Big Tech's massive appetite for AI data centers and electric vehicles. By 2050, electricity is projected to become the largest source of energy worldwide, according to a recent McKinsey study. Also, five of the top 10 returning companies in the S&P 500 this year have been energy companies, noted Matt Sallee, president of Tortoise Capital. “Utilities and midstream infrastructure are going to be secondary beneficiaries of the AI theme,” he said in a recent note. There’s no better example of that investor fever than the S&P 500's top performer this year, power producer Vistra Corp (VST). Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company are up 243% year to date, outperforming even AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), up 186% during the same period. On Thursday, JPMorgan analysts initiated coverage of Vistra along with two other Wall Street favorites, Talen Energy (TLN) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — all with an Overweight rating, The analysts said the independent power producers (IPPs) stand to benefit from "a paradigm shift in power demand" amid structural tailwinds like manufacturing on-shoring, electrification trends, and data-center development. "We do not see competitive market supply growth matching this demand, enabling IPPs to capture outsized margins for an extended period of time," wrote JPMorgan's Jeremy Tonet and his team. As Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman pointed out, recent headlines like Microsoft (MSFT) teaming up with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, and Amazon (AMZN) buying up a data center campus from Talen Energy have put Big Tech and its insatiable need for electricity into the spotlight. But XLU's massive performance this year begs the question — has it topped? With the broader markets at all-time highs, it may be a good idea to keep investing in defensive stocks like utilities that provide dividends, said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. “There does seem to be a little bit more meat on the bone,” said McKinney, referring to more growth ahead. If XLU holds its 29.1% year-to-date gains, it will be the best-ever yearly performance for the sector. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

Title: Netflix doesn't think it needs to bundle with other streamers — yet. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/netflix-bundles-ceo-ted-sarandos-1851676407
Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:34:00Z

While other streaming services are increasingly turning to bundles to help boost subscriber numbers, Netflix (NFLX+1.06%) says it doesn’t need them. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on Thursday that a lot of the company’s competitors are using bundles to “find growth in their businesses.” He added that this made sense and was a “comfortable” business model for legacy media companies, given “the narrow scope of the libraries on these services and the fairly limited engagement.” Instead, he said, Netflix is focused on adding more value to its own package, which he characterized as “amazing series and films and now games at a remarkably low price all in one place.” Sarandos’ comments come at a time when other media companies are struggling to catch up with the dominant Netflix and are still trying to figure out how to make their services consistently profitable. One emerging strategy to boost subscriber numbers is bundling. For example, in July, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery teamed up to offer a new bundle that combines all of their streaming platforms into one monthly subscription plan. Sarandos was also reaffirming the sentiments expressed in Netflix’s letter to shareholders included in its strong third-quarter earnings report on Thursday. “Programming for such a large, engaged audience, with so much variety and great quality, is hard. It’s why streaming services which lack our breadth of content are increasingly looking to bundle their offerings,” the letter said. And so far it seems like investors are in agreement, as Netflix stock jumped 9% on Friday. “Overall, we believe Netflix is well positioned to remain a long-term winner in the streaming space,” wrote William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart in a note on Friday. Simlarly Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a note on Friday, “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars. We expect it to maintain this competitive edge while rivals struggle to replicate its business model.” She also expressed optimism about Netflix’s growing ad business suggesting it could “become the primary growth driver by 2026.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Netflix (NFLX) shares surged to a record high Friday, a day after the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. Bank of America boosted its price target to $800 from $740, calling Netflix “one of the best positioned companies within media,” with multiple growth drivers including its “burgeoning ad business.” Netflix’s ad-supported membership grew 35% quarter-over-quarter, and the company said it expects to launch an ad tech platform in 2025. Analysts at JPMorgan lifted their price target even higher, to $850 from $750, and called Netflix a "top pick," citing its "strong leadership position" with a “virtuous circle of strong subscriber growth, more revenue, and growing profit.” Including Bank of America, about three-quarters of the 20 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock as of Friday, though their average price target at $777.21 was not far off from Friday's closing price. Shares of Netflix jumped over 11% to close at $763.89 Friday and have gained nearly 57% since the start of the year. Netflix's gains came despite some programming challenges, calling it “patchier than normal,” due to the lingering impacts of actors and writers strikes in 2023, and said “volume has picked up again.” Netflix said it delivered several hits in the quarter, with “The Perfect Couple” starring Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber drawing 65.2 million views, while romantic comedy “Nobody Wants This" with Kristen Bell and Adam Brody drew 37 million.

Title: American Express' Mixed Q3 Results: Goldman Analyst Sees Silver Lining In Expense Management And NII Growth

Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:09:24Z

American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) stock slid Friday after its third-quarter print failed to impress the Street. The third-quarter revenue (net of interest expense) grew 8% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $16.67 billion. Higher loan volumes, stable growth in Card Member spending, and accelerated card fee revenue growth triggered the topline growth. Also Read: What’s Going On With Trump Media & Technology Group Stock On Friday? Goldman Sachs analyst Ryan M. Nash reiterated a Buy rating on American Express with a price target of $300. Goldman Sachs: Nash summarized American Express Co’s third-quarter performance. It reported third-quarter 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $3.49, surpassing Visible Alpha’s consensus estimate of $3.30. Core pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) exceeded expectations at $4.56 billion compared to the consensus of $4.45 billion, as lower expenses offset slightly weaker revenue. Core revenue grew 8% year-over-year (FX-adjusted) to $16.64 billion, just shy of the $16.67 billion estimate. Net interest income (NII) rose 16% year-over-year to $4.01 billion, beating expectations of $3.92 billion. In comparison, fees grew 5.8% year-over-year to $12.63 billion, falling short of the $12.75 billion projection due to lower discount revenues. Billed business increased 6% year-over-year (FX-adjusted) to $441 billion, with Goods & Services up 6% and Travel & Entertainment (T&E) slowing to 6%, down from 7% the previous quarter. Expenses were 1% lower than anticipated, primarily due to reduced variable engagement costs (VECs), as total cardmember costs (including marketing) rose 12% year-over-year to $8.25 billion, below the expected $8.5 billion. Core operating expenses were higher at $3.83 billion compared to the $3.72 billion estimate. Credit performance was in line with expectations, with provisions at $1.36 billion and net charge-offs of 2.1%, which were better than anticipated. American Express adjusted its full-year 2024 guidance, lowering expected revenue growth to 9% (from the previous 9 – 11% range) and raising its EPS outlook to $13.75 – $14.05, up from the previous $13.30 – $13.80. This increase includes a $0.66 gain from Accertify. According to Nash, this was a mixed quarter for American Express. Revenues came in slightly below expectations due to weaker discount revenues. However, higher NII and card fees provided some support. Lower-than-expected expenses helped offset higher operating costs. Credit metrics remained steady, with provisions meeting expectations and losses coming in lower than anticipated. However, the market may be concerned about American Express Co’s revenue mix as NII thrives (16% Y/Y). In comparison, discount revenues increased only 4% Y/Y, raising questions about future growth. The outlook for revenue growth, significantly as NII will likely slow, will likely be a key focus on the upcoming call. On the upcoming call, Nash will seek insight into what drove American Express Co’s decision to revise its year-over-year revenue growth forecast to around 9%, down from the previous 9%-11%, and the company’s outlook for future revenue growth. The analyst also expected updates on card fees. He will seek an update on billed business growth, which stayed flat this quarter. Additionally, it will be necessary to hear about the trajectory for net interest income (NII), as the growth rate slowed slightly from 20% in the second quarter to 17% but still shows strong performance. Further, Nash sought the company’s view on customer engagement costs, which were down quarter-over-quarter, with VECs expected to stay near 42%, though they were 40.7% in the third quarter. The analyst also expects more information on the 3.3 million new card acquisitions and whether the company can sustain this momentum. Finally, he sought clarity on credit performance, as net charge-offs (NCOs) came in better than expected. American Express updated its 2024 guidance, anticipating revenue growth of around 9%, down from the prior 9% – 11%, which matches the consensus estimate of $65.99 billion. It also raised its EPS outlook to $13.75 – $14.05, up from $13.30 – $13.80, with the midpoint implying $13.90 versus the consensus of $13.74. Based on this, Nash estimates fourth-quarter EPS of around $2.95, just below the consensus of $2.98, and revenue of approximately $17.19 billion, indicating 3.3% quarter-over-quarter growth.

Sorry, dividend investors: You probably won’t be rushing to add Netflix (NFLX) to your portfolios. During the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, CFO Spencer Neuman said that the company has "no plans to increase leverage to buy back stock or to issue a dividend." Neuman said Netflix is still prioritizing “profitable growth by reinvesting in our business” and maintaining “ample liquidity.” Wall Street expects Netflix's full-year free cash flow to top $10 billion in 2026, according to Visible Alpha data. Still, Neuman said Netflix isn’t planning to change its capital allocation strategy. The company said Thursday that it repurchased $1.7 billion of its shares during the third quarter, with more than $3 billion of currently authorized buybacks remaining. “In terms of [the] kind of future of free cash flow, well, that future of throwing off tens of billions of free cash flow, that would be a great future and would be a nice challenge to have,” said Neuman on the call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. “But no change to our capital allocation policy.” Netflix reported third-quarter results on Thursday. The company's stock was recently up more than 10%. Other big tech companies have a history of issuing dividends—including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

Netflix (NFLX) stock jumped more than 10% higher on Friday, pushing shares to a fresh record of around $760, after the streaming giant beat third quarter EPS and revenue estimates and projected sales for the current quarter that came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.78 billion to hit $9.83 billion in Q3, Netflix reported after the market close on Thursday, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. The growth came as the streamer continued to lean on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans. Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $10.13 billion, a beat compared to consensus estimates of $10.01 billion. For full-year 2025, the company sees revenue hitting between $43 billion and $44 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $43.4 billion. This would represent growth of 11% to 13% from the company's expected 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. It expects full-year operating margins to hit 27%, an increase from the previous 26%, after the metric hit nearly 30% in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $5.40, above consensus expectations of $5.16 and well ahead of the $3.73 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to fourth quarter EPS of $4.23, ahead of consensus calls for $3.90. Subscribers also came in strong with another 5 million-plus subscribers added on the heels of breakout programming like "The Perfect Couple" and "Nobody Wants This." Subscriber additions of 5.07 million beat expectations of 4.5 million and follows the 8.05 million net additions the streamer added in the second quarter. The company had added 8.8 million paying users in Q3 2023. "We expect paid net additions to be higher in Q4 than in Q3’24 due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate," the company said, citing upcoming releases like "Squid Game" Season 2, the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. Investors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction, accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered during the third quarter. "We continue to build our advertising business and improve our offering for advertisers," the company said in the earnings release. "Ads membership was up 35% quarter on quarter, and our ad tech platform is on track to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025." Last quarter, Netflix revealed it secured "a 150% plus increase in upfront ad sales commitments over 2023." The company has previously said its goal is to make ads "a more substantial revenue stream that contributes to sustained, healthy revenue growth in 2025 and beyond." On the earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said that while ads won't be a primary driver of revenue next year as "we're still scaling that audience and that inventory faster than our ability to monetize it," the company sees an "opportunity to close that gap." Leading up to the results, Netflix's stock had been on a tear, with shares up around 45% since the start of the year and trading near all-time highs. Analysts expect another price hike by the end of the year, which will likely serve as yet another catalyst for shares. But the stock's recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street. The company recently revealed subscribers watched over 94 billion hours on the platform from January to June as part of its latest biannual viewership report, although year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to pricing power, which has become especially important for streaming companies as consumers become more picky. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Retaining loyal subscribers over time is a challenge due to consumers churning out of, or canceling, their subscription plans. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, introduced less than two years ago, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025," Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said ahead of the report. The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience.

Investing.com -- Jefferies analysts upgraded their price target for AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) from $108 to $175 in a note Friday, citing optimistic trends in mobile gaming ad spending revealed in their latest survey. The survey, representing over $1.2 billion in app install spending, reportedly suggests that major players like APP, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are expected to gain market share in 2025, while Unity (U) may lose ground. In their note, Jefferies analysts said the initial outlook for 2025 app install spending indicates a significant acceleration to 6.7% growth. While the survey forecasts a modest 2.7% growth for 2024, 2025 is projected to benefit from increased spending on new game launches and successful existing titles. "We see this initial view into 2025 as optimistic for the ad networks," stated Jefferies. The analysts also highlighted that ad spending is expected to grow by 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. Moreover, Jefferies reported that APP was the largest share gainer in 2024 and is anticipated to continue this momentum into 2025. "APP's user quality and ability to scale spend" were underscored as key advantages. The analysts pointed out that the rising cost per install (CPI) on platforms like YouTube and Meta, particularly due to holiday and political spending, could lead to a shift in shares toward mobile-game-specific networks. Despite pressures on effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs), Jefferies forecasts that the overall mobile game ad revenue will experience growth in 2025. "Our survey suggests that APP should be able to sustain 20-30% Software Platform revenue growth for at least the next two years," the note added. With this outlook, Jefferies sees a potential bull case price target of $246 for APP, driven by incremental ad budgets from e-commerce.

Title: Data centers try to cool it as AI explodes, and Big Tech goes nuclear

UPDATED 10:55 EDT / OCTOBER 18 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof What a turnaround for nuclear power — and it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence. This week two more Big Tech companies bet on nukes as Google and Amazon joined the party Microsoft started a few weeks ago. All that training of AI models takes a lot of power. And that’s despite, or because of, the fact that AI models are getting smaller and easier to use, as a raft of announcements this week made apparent. AI is also exploding the data center, as all the talk at the Open Compute Project’s Global Summit this week was about accommodating AI workloads — such as Crusoe’s plans for building an AI megafactory in Texas — and the massive increase in power, heat and networking needs they require. Indeed, as a result, networking is the not-so-new but now critical bottleneck in the data center. Companies such as Lightmatter and xScape Photonics are betting big on the opportunity. Paul Gillin lays out the very public Snowflake-Databricks clash in detail in the definitive story of the latest battle of the AI era. Ironically, given all the heat AI is producing, it’s about Apache Iceberg, the management layer that sits atop data files in cloud storage. Google shook up its management team, in particular in search and ads, as well as Gemini AI. It looks like DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has finally consolidated his hold on all things AI at Google. Down is up and up is down in the chip industry. In a hell-freezes-over moment, Intel and AMD decided to cooperate on standardizing the x86 chip instruction set. Meanwhile, TSMC and ASML issued widely different earnings results — chipmaker TSMC benefiting from roaring AI chip sales and equipment maker ASML suffering from a drop in sales to China and Samsung. Next week’s events include UiPath Forward and Celonis’ Celosphere, and we’ll have news and interviews on theCUBE from both. The enterprise earnings season kicks off with IBM, Seagate, SAP, ServiceNow, Pegasystems, Western Digital and Tesla, ahead of a much large number of reports the following two weeks from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and many others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend for some lean-back reading. Meantime, check out this past week’s installment, zeroing in on Microsoft’s much-debated Azure revenue and what it means for the overall cloud market. Here’s all of this week’s top news, newsy topics and analysis from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Big-data dust-up: Why two AI giants are at war over who is more open Accel says generative AI startups get 40% of VC investment in cloud OpenAI, Microsoft reportedly hire banks to renegotiate partnership terms Generative AI churns the waters at European NoCode Summit The next phase of AI: Unlocking explainability with causal intelligence Mistral introduces Ministral 3B and 8B AI computing models for phones and laptops AWS and Databricks to deliver more affordable generative AI for joint customers H2O.ai releases small language models for multimodal processing tasks LatticeFlow releases framework for checking LLMs’ compliance with the EU AI Act Google looks to spearhead AI adoption in the public sector DataStax merges its data stack with Nvidia’s development tools to simplify AI development and fine-tuning Adobe introduces new generative AI features for its creative applications Domino Data Lab seeks to embed governance in AI development Cognizant enhances Neuro AI platform for faster AI use case deployment OutSystems integrates generative AI with low-code to accelerate and simplify app development Big data startup UltiHash unveils advanced deduplication to boost AI storage efficiency Terray Therapeutics rakes in $120M for AI-powered small molecule drug development AI startups Decagon and Neuron7 raise millions to transform customer service and repairs AI observability firm Galileo raises $45M to improve AI model accuracy Omnea raises $25M to streamline procurement with AI French AI startup Gladia raises $16M and launches multilingual real-time transcription engine Data science and AI development platform Zerve raises $7.6M Simplismart raises $7M to help enterprises run their own AI models with rapid inference and full control Amplitude buys Command AI to help companies integrate AI-assisted onboarding and product tours into software There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Completing the cloud nuclear trifecta after Microsoft last month announced it will tap into a reopened Three Mile Island: Google to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactor startup Kairos Power and Amazon to invest in three nuclear energy projects But these are all going to take years to produce energy, so it’s not going to solve the data center energy crunch anytime soon. At the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, which focuses on new technologies and standards for data centers, the talk was all about how AI is changing everything in the data center, and creating new problems to solve: * Does it seem hot in here?: If there’s one thing everyone’s freaking out about, it’s heat — specifically the heat generated by servers full of chips from Nvidia and other AI accelerator chipmakers. There were dozens of companies offering liquid-cooling solutions, considerably more than last year if I remember correctly. “You can no longer air-cool these servers,” said Saurabh Dighe, corporate VP for Microsoft Azure strategic planning and architecture. They need to be liquid-cooled.” * But AI chips aren’t the only source of heat. Copper wire works fine in individual data center racks, but with AI forcing more racks to be connected to tackle training of huge AI models, optical interconnects are becoming more and more critical — and those interconnects currently also take a lot of power and produce a lot of heat. “We need to get the power down,” said Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder and chief architect of Arista Networks. “We cannot change the laws of physics, but we can come up with better connectors.” That’s something established companies and startups such as Lightspeed are working hard to do. * Sustainability was the other, closely related byword at the summit. One standard being mulled is how to use “all that warm water from [cooling] data centers for more than just letting it evaporate in the air,” said Supermicro VP of Solutions Thomas Garvens. * But the problem with standards is that they take a lot of meetings and back-and-forth to establish. “Standards can take more time than we have in the era of AI,” said Google Principal Engineer Amber Huffman. * By the way, if it weren’t apparent already, networking looks to be the biggest bottleneck in the AI era. “The networking is essentially becoming the computer,” said Sameh Boujelgene of market researcher Dell’Oro Group. * ”Pigs can fly”: AMD EVP Forrest Norrod used that phrase to describe a deal between AMD and Intel to create an x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, which although not an OCP project was revealed onstage at the summit by Norrod and Intel EVP Justin Hotard. If Intel weren’t in such a hole, this never would have happened, given the decades of legal and market battles between the two. But if either of them wants to challenge Arm, whose designs are now powering data center chips for cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft, they need an instruction set as unified as Arm’s to ensure software compatibility among Intel and AMD chips and keep developers on the x86 train. Our story: Intel and AMD team up to improve the x86 processor architecture There was lots of other news, honestly a lot of pretty arcane stuff, but no surprise that Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang insists all data centers must become “AI factories,” captured so much attention: Nvidia aims to boost Blackwell GPUs by donating platform design to the Open Compute Project And this startup is betting big on one ginormous factory: Crusoe’s $3.4B joint venture to build AI data center campus with up to 100,000 GPUs Breaking Analysis: What Microsoft’s financial disclosures reveal about Azure’s market position And it may force other big companies to reveal more about their AI revenue. Private equity is bottom-fishing for software-as-a-service companies, which are increasingly being pressured by generative AI — not just because of investor interest but because chatbots have the potential to replace a good chunk of SaaS: Permira completes its $7.2B acquisition of Squarespace and Zuora to be acquired by Silverlake and GIC in $1.7B cash deal Intel reportedly seeking to sell minority stake in Altera at $17B valuation Lightmatter raises $400M at $4.4B valuation for next-gen photonic data center networking Xscape Photonics raises $44M to accelerate development of laser-based chip interconnects ASML shares plunge on lowered 2025 revenue forecast TSMC shares jump on expectation-topping third-quarter results Dialpad expands workforce management capabilities with Surfboard acquisition Developer tooling startup Port sails away with $35M in funding Everstage raises $30M to enhance sales performance management platform Lidar chip startup Lidwave closes $10M investment Clerk Chat raises $7M to simplify business text messaging VMware settles securities fraud class suit with $102.5M payout (per The Register) Salesforce launches customized financial services cloud platform for insurers HashiCorp debuts new Terraform Stacks and Vault updates at HashiConf 2024 Tableau Software updates data visualization and cloud analytics management SUSE enhances edge computing with new releases focused on scalability and efficiency Cato Networks expands SASE Cloud Platform with new Digital Experience Monitoring service Presidio expands AWS partnership to drive AI adoption and cloud migration We have more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Google enhances security and management for corporate-owned Android devices Akamai introduces Behavioral DDoS Engine and AI Assistance to strengthen security portfolio Bitdefender’s new AI copilot works in real time to protect consumers from online scams Lookout adds ‘smishing’ and executive impersonation protection to mobile security platform Nametag launches ‘Deepfake Defense’ and expands Okta partnership to combat AI impersonation OneSpan introduces VISION FX for phishing-resistant banking security Tenable brings intelligent data and AI resource security risk management to the cloud Cyera acquires Trail Security for $162M to expand AI-powered data security platform DeNexus expands cyber risk management platform with $17.5M investment More cybersecurity news here Amazon refreshes its Kindle e-reader lineup with four new devices FTC makes canceling subscriptions less of a pain with ‘click to cancel’ rule Google files for emergency stay against Epic lawsuit it lost — and it gets it Sam Altman’s Worldcoin rebrands as World and launches updated iris-scanning Orb Stripe reportedly in talks to acquire fintech startup Bridge for $1B Blockstream raises $210M to boost bitcoin blockchain layer 2 scaling technology Path Robotics secures $100M Series D funding for its AI-enabled robotic welding technology IoT startup Monogoto raises $27M to accelerate its global expansion And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Google reshuffles product leadership team and two AI units DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis gets the rest of Gemini, cementing his hold on all things AI at Google and elevating him to perhaps the No. 2 exec under Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 160 points on Friday morning, while other major stock indexes rose, partly driven by Netflix’s strong earnings report. After the opening bell, the Dow fell 162 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite popped up 0.6%. Video streaming could have been the end of TV commercials, but now even Netflix (NFLX+1.06%) is making its advertising business a “priority.” This comes as the streaming giant shifts its focus from subscriber growth to profit. Netflix (NFLX+1.06%) stock rose more than 10% Friday morning following an impressive earnings report Thursday. It added more than five million paid subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, outperforming Wall Street expectations of 3.5 million. CVS Health (CVS-2.52%) announced a change in its chief executive officer and cautioned that its upcoming earnings are likely to disappoint predictions from Wall Street, leading to a more than 7% drop in shares during early trading. David Joyner has been appointed president and CEO and will assume the role on Oct. 17. He will be succeeding Karen Lynch. Joyner, who has nearly four decades of experience in the health care sector, was previously the executive vice president and president of CVS Caremark. He has also held pivotal roles at Aetna, one of the company’s currently struggling divisions. Joyner will join the Board, while current chairman Roger Farah takes on the role of executive chairman. — Francisco Velasquez and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: Klaviyo stock target lifted, overweight on growth prospects
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/klaviyo-stock-target-lifted-overweight-on-growth-prospects-93CH-3671056
Time Published: 2024-10-18T13:17:45Z
Full Content:
On Friday, Piper Sandler, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on shares of Klaviyo Inc (NYSE:NYSE:KVYO), raising the price target to $45.00 from the previous $34.00. The firm sustained its Overweight rating on the company's stock. The revision reflects a positive view of the company's growth trajectory, as Klaviyo's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is expected to surpass $1 billion, with an anticipated growth rate of over 28% year-over-year at the end of the year. Klaviyo's platform, which provides marketing tools that leverage data to enhance revenue streams through various channels like SMS, e-mail, and mobile push, is currently used by more than 151,000 retail brands. Notable clients include Vuori, Unilever (LON:ULVR), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). The analyst noted that new features and integrations with platforms such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Canva, TikTok, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) could significantly impact sales during the upcoming Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) season. The company's international prospects are also looking up, with planned expansions in language support. Presently supporting English and French, Klaviyo aims to include German, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Portuguese to cater to a broader global customer base. This move is expected to bolster the company's international expansion efforts in the following year. Piper Sandler expressed increased confidence in Klaviyo's ability to maintain a growth rate of over 25% and achieve a 10% or higher operating margin model. The updated price target of $45 is indicative of this optimism and the potential that the financial services firm sees in the company's strategic initiatives and market position. In other recent news, Klaviyo's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives have attracted attention. Klaviyo's revenue exceeded forecasts by $10 million, and operating profits rose by 65% year over year. Several analyst firms, including Baird and Benchmark, have reacted positively to these developments. Baird raised its price target for Klaviyo shares in anticipation of a strong third-quarter earnings report. Benchmark initiated coverage of Klaviyo's shares with a Buy rating, emphasizing the company's strategic integration of various marketing technologies. Moreover, KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded Klaviyo's stock to Overweight due to the company's strong growth trajectory. Barclays and TD Cowen also displayed confidence in Klaviyo's growth prospects, upgrading the stock rating to overweight and maintaining a Buy rating, respectively. In addition to its financial performance, Klaviyo has announced a partnership with TikTok to integrate its customer segmentation tools with the social media platform. This move is expected to enhance ad targeting and improve relationships with potential buyers. These are just some of the recent developments that have kept Klaviyo in the spotlight. Klaviyo's strong market position and growth potential, as highlighted by Piper Sandler's upgraded price target, are further supported by real-time data from InvestingPro. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 38.38% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and a 35.01% quarterly growth in Q2 2024. This aligns with the analyst's expectations of continued strong growth. InvestingPro Tips reveal that Klaviyo holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation to support its expansion plans. Additionally, nine analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting growing confidence in the company's near-term performance. The stock's recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, with a strong 49.38% return over the last three months and a substantial 63.93% return over the past six months. This momentum has pushed the stock to trade near its 52-week high, with the current price at 98.06% of that peak. While these metrics paint a positive picture, investors should note that Klaviyo is currently trading at a high revenue valuation multiple and is not yet profitable over the last twelve months. However, analysts predict the company will become profitable this year, which could be a significant catalyst for the stock. For readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Klaviyo, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: AWS CEO Matt Garman says employees could quit if they don't want to come into office

Amazon AWS CEO Matt Garman has said that employees who don't want to abide by the new rules coming into force next year, which will see workers come in for five days a week, can resign. Garman didn't seem to be saying it in an antagonistic way, just that some people may not work well in the new environment, and if not, there are always other companies around that will let you work from home. Garman made the remarks yesterday during an all-hands meeting. He said that 90% of employees he had spoken to were on board with the new policy, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. He was quoted as saying: "If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around. By the way, I don't mean that in a bad way, we want to be in an environment where we're working together. When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in person." As you'd expect, not everyone at the company is thrilled about the idea of spending extra time commuting. Some people point to the fact that the benefits of working in the office aren't supported by independent data. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has been running a three-day-in-the-office policy where workers go into work for just three days a week. Garman said that the switch to being in the office five days a week will eliminate the issue of missing colleagues if they choose to work on different days. Going into the office five days a week is pretty much a return to the situation before the pandemic. Amazon believes that workers will get more done in the office so it's eager to get back to that. As many tech firms are doing layoffs, it will be unlikely that many people quit their Amazon jobs over this issue as it may be hard to get another job.

American Express Co’s (NYSE:AXP) third-quarter revenue (net of interest expense) grew 8% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $16.67 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, increased Card Member spending, and continued strong card fee growth. Amex’s stock price went up after the report, but it soon gave up the gains in the premarket session on Friday. Also Read: Citigroup Remains A Compelling Investment Opportunity: Analysts Take On Q3 Performance Adjusted EPS of $3.49 beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.28. Card Member spending or Billed Business grew 6% (or 6% forex adjusted) year-over-year to $387.3 billion. U.S. Consumer Services revenue was $7.944 billion, up 10% year over year. Commercial Services revenue was $3.998 billion, up 7% year over year. International Card Services revenue was $2.936 billion, up 11% year over year, and Global Merchant and Network Services revenue was $1.847 billion, flat year over year. Total expenses increased by 9% year over year to $12.1 billion, primarily reflecting higher customer engagement costs due to higher Card Member spending, increased usage of travel-related benefits, and higher marketing investments. Provision for credit losses stood at $1.4 billion, compared with $1.2 billion a year ago, reflecting higher net write-offs. FY24 Outlook: Amex expects revenue growth of 9% or $65.96 billion (versus prior expectations of 9%–11% or $65.96 billion–$67.17 billion) versus consensus of $65.97 billion. It has raised its EPS outlook to $13.75–$14.05 (from $13.30–$13.80 prior) versus the consensus of $13.14. In August, B of A Securities analyst Kenneth Bruce downgraded American Express, citing continued inflation and the higher rate environment affecting consumer demand. He did not expect the company to deliver its previously guided 9%- 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2024. At least 3 Wall Street firms, including JP Morgan, HSBC, and BTIG, downgraded the stock in October. American Express stock is up 89% in the last 12 months. Price Action: AXP stock is down 2.79% at $277.80 premarket at the last check on Friday.

U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week; Netflix (NFLX) shares are surging after the streaming giant grew subscribers and beat analysts' estimates; CVS Health (CVS) shares are tumbling after it replaced its CEO; Apple (AAPL) shares are moving higher on strong iPhone 16 sales in China; and Nvidia (NVDA) stock continues to climb after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) earnings showed strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): ‘How Can You Have A Bull Birthday Party Without Inviting Meta?’

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list. On a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. “The whole first year of this bull’s life was an anomaly. That’s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,” Cramer explained. He emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, “Every night I say there’s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it’s been right in front of you.” Cramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying: “The bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I’d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.” Cramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates. “We had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.” He did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become “Fed watchers,” suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained: “When the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.” Cramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added: “Sure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.” Cramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. “Forget the macro, people. It’s not that meaningful when the Fed’s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,” he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that’s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Cramer mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in his list of stocks with the biggest gains. He emphasized Mark Zuckerberg's assertion that future ad campaigns will focus on Instagram and Reels and said: “Honestly, how can you have a bull birthday party without inviting Meta, without inviting Mark Zuckerberg? I would never think of it. His last conference call told you a tale that made it sound like all ad campaigns will soon start on Instagram and reels. Am I going to doubt this fella? No. He has the AI to design the most effective targeted ads and you don't need to hire an advertising agency. Much better return on investment.” It is a leading technology company that focuses on creating products designed to facilitate connections and sharing among users through a variety of devices, including mobile phones, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The financial performance of Meta (NASDAQ:META) has been remarkable over the years, largely driven by the ongoing shift toward digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is expected to expand from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. With nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its platforms, the company generates significant advertising revenue. In its most recent quarterly report, Meta (NASDAQ:META) recorded an impressive $38.3 billion in ad revenue and a 22% increase in overall revenue compared to the previous year. The growth is particularly noteworthy given the scale of the company, which points to a strong demand for its advertising capabilities. Overall META ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Amazon boss has a brutal response to staffers who don’t like 5-day RTO mandate: Leave
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/amazon-matt-garman-return-to-office-mandate/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s push to get employees back into the office five days a week is boiling down to a rather blunt argument: If staffers don’t like it, they can work elsewhere. At an all-hands meeting for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, CEO Matt Garman bluntly told colleagues that if they didn’t like the controversial policy, they should leave. The tech giant’s push to get employees back to their in-office desks five days a week hasn’t been simple. In February last year, some 16,000 employees joined a Slack channel and launched a petition to oppose CEO Andy Jassy’s call to return to the office for “the majority of the week.” In February 2023, that meant only three days a week, but by September 2024, it was increased to mandatory in-office attendance every day of the working week starting from January 2025. In an internal call this week—first reported by Reuters—Garman doubled down on the decision, saying Amazon didn’t want employees who couldn’t handle being in the office that frequently. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said, per Reuters. “By the way, I don’t mean that in a bad way,” he continued. He said he wanted staff to be “in an environment where we’re working together.” Garman said he isn’t seeing enough evidence to support the idea that the Jeff Bezos–founded company is innovating fast enough under a hybrid working model, adding: “When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we’re not in-person.” Given the fact that teams were in for three days—and not necessarily the same three days—“we didn’t really accomplish anything, like, we didn’t get to work together and learn from each other,” Garman reportedly added. Amazon did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. According to a transcript of the all-hands seen by CNBC, Garman insisted that of the colleagues he has spoken to, “nine out of 10” are looking forward to the new mandate being enforced. Perhaps Garman has just been lucky with the people he has spoken to, as staffers posting on social media sites and internal channels have expressed their fury at the goalposts once again changing—impacting their commute and family dynamics. “Amazon has announced 5-day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on LinkedIn with an accompanying #OpenToWork banner signaling their intention to leave the company. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me,” the staffer continued. “Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.” Tech staffers looking to leave Amazon for a rival face uncertain prospects, with layoffs sweeping through companies offering a more flexible office-to-hybrid working structure. Meta, for example, allows its staff to work from home two days a week, and Google has a similar policy. Microsoft on the other hand allows staff to work as flexibly as they want, with a VP at the company recently telling staffers the policy will stay in place as long as productivity remains high. Amazon’s culture is very closely linked to its leadership principles, many of which hark back to the days when billionaire entrepreneur Bezos was at the helm. Current CEO Andy Jassy is still a proponent of the principles, with Garman reportedly adding that teams not being together, in-person and full-time, is getting in the way of these guiding ideas. Speaking of the leadership principles, Garman is reported to have said: “You can’t internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day.” Along with well-known ideas like Amazon’s “customer obsession,” there is the notion of disagree and commit, where individuals voice their opinions but join the general consensus whether or not they agree. “I don’t know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,” Garman continued, referring to an internal messaging platform. “It’s very hard.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Google’s search and ads chief is out
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/googles-search-and-ads-chief-is-out/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:40:12Z

Good morning. I was delighted to learn recently that Winamp, the free audio player of choice for a certain demographic (cough) of Windows users at the turn of the millennium, soldiers on to this day. Apparently “tens of millions” of users still fire it up on a regular basis, according to its Belgian owner—hopefully still with skins that look like an aftermarket head unit from a ‘96 Mitsubishi Eclipse. The name of Winamp’s owner, by the way? Llama Group. Which really whips…ah, nevermind. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. It’s big news, even for big tech: Prabhakar Raghavan, the most senior Google executive overseeing search and advertising, is leaving his gig. He spent four years leading the company’s core business. Raghavan isn’t leaving Google; he’ll become its chief technologist. “He’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence,” CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo. Why the change? Likely because Google’s cash cow is under assault. (And parent company Alphabet, for all its divisions, is still largely driven by that cash cow.) Artificial intelligence assistants threaten to replace search as the leading destination for information and antitrust regulators have taken the company’s primary moneymaker to task. Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan (and immediately occupy the “who will succeed Sundar” seat), with two caveats: The team overseeing Google’s Gemini generative assistant will move out of Raghavan’s former org and into Google DeepMind, and the team overseeing Google Assistant will join the group that handles the Android mobile operating system. Watch this space. —AN No one said the AI wars wouldn’t get heated. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff took to social media yesterday to put rival Microsoft on blast for its “disappointing” AI-powered assistant, Copilot. “It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy,” he wrote. “Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess.” (Salesforce, naturally, has been promoting its own AI-powered agent called Einstein. Ahem.) It’s not the first time Benioff has taken a swing at Copilot. He called the tool “the new Clippy,” in a dig at Microsoft’s memorable 1990s feature, in a television interview a month ago. Why the war footing? Because Salesforce needs to win mindshare against its more entrenched peers. Microsoft is able to win customers simply by deploying Copilot across its Office business suite as well as developer favorite GitHub; same deal for Google and Gemini. Salesforce may be tops in customer relationship management software—its ticker is CRM for a reason—but its peers are far bigger. Just remember, Marc: Coffee is for closers. —AN If 2023 was Meta’s “Year of Efficiency” then how come it’s still going on in late 2024? According to The Verge, the company is laying off staffers as it reorganizes teams in its WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs units. Meta says the aim is “to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.” So, nothing to do with Meta’s eye-watering capital expenditure in the AI race, then. But it’s not just Meta. Intel, which is struggling because of multiple reasons including the AI chip race, let go more than 2,000 employees in the U.S. this week. And Nokia, the telecommunications equipment maker, just announced over 2,000 job cuts in China, where life becomes ever harder for Western businesses. It’s not clear how many Meta employees are affected by the latest cuts there, but the figure’s unlikely to be in the same ballpark. In 2018, Zuora was on top of the world. The business software company had just gone public on the New York Stock Exchange. Founder and CEO Tien Tzuo had published a philosophical book called Subscribed. Seemingly everything was moving to a subscription-based business model—music to the ears of a company built to launch and manage such things. It’s been tough sledding in the years since. Revenue growth has proven steady but unspectacular. Rounds of layoffs have been demoralizing, even if they’ve kept the company’s profits in line. And the company’s stock has been hovering below $10 a share, making it a prime acquisition target. The winning suitors? None other than private equity firm Silver Lake and Singaporean wealth fund GIC. The pair announced Thursday that they will pick up Zuora for what amounts to $1.7 billion, a 6.2% premium, when the deal closes in early 2025. In theory, going private will allow Zuora to reverse its recent slowdown and better compete with billing rivals SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce. At least that’s what its new owners, uh, subscribe to. —AN It’s a win for the hearing impaired everywhere. The Federal Communications Commission approved new regulations on Thursday that require phonemakers to make their devices compatible with hearing aids, and vice versa. The rule includes recently approved over-the-counter hearing aids, which includes Apple’s “clinical grade” AirPods Pro 2. The FCC didn’t stop there. The federal agency approved a regulation that requires all new mobile handsets sold in the U.S. to allow users to raise the volume without introducing distortion. It also rolled out mandates that phone labels at point of sale include hearing aid compatibility. After a transition period, “Americans with hearing loss will no longer be limited…in the mobile handset marketplace,” the FCC said. To which we say: Heard. —AN —Stripe sniffs around a crypto stablecoin acquisition. The purported price? One billion dollars. —Netflix ad-tier subscribers jump 35%. It beat estimates—barely—in its latest quarter. —Automattic CEO tells staff: Loose lips sink ships. Nearly 160 take a buyout as the company wades through deepening legal drama. —FBI arrests suspect in SEC social media hack. The stunt drove up Bitcoin’s price by $1,000. —Permira takes Squarespace private for $7.2b. It also sold Tock, a foodie favorite, to American Express. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Citi maintains Neutral rating on NFLX stock

Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:25:47Z

Citi has maintained its Neutral rating on Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:NFLX), with a steady price target of $675.00. The streaming giant's third-quarter financial results surpassed market expectations, with a reported revenue approximately 1% higher than Wall Street forecasts and an operating income that was 7% above consensus. Netflix's performance in the third quarter included a significant increase in subscribers, with 5.1 million net additions compared to the Video Advertising (VA) consensus prediction of 4.6 million. The company's positive momentum is further indicated by its fourth-quarter projections for operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS), which are all higher than analyst expectations. Furthermore, Netflix has provided a forecast for its 2025 revenue and operating income margin that aligns closely with current Street estimates. This outlook, combined with the company's recent financial achievements, suggests a potential uptick in Netflix's share value, particularly following some recent declines. In other recent news, Netflix exhibited a notable performance in the third quarter, with an addition of 5.1 million new subscribers, surpassing expectations. The streaming giant also projected a sequential rise in net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter, aiming for a total of 13 million by the end of 2023. Firms such as Morgan Stanley and Bernstein have responded positively to these developments, raising their price targets for Netflix to $830 and $780, respectively. On the other hand, Phillip Securities downgraded Netflix's stock from Buy to Neutral, despite raising the price target to $695. This comes in the wake of robust revenue and profit growth, but the firm adopted a neutral stance due to the recent strength in Netflix's share price. Canaccord Genuity also adjusted its price target for Netflix to $760 from $750, maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. Netflix's full-year revenue growth expectations have been revised upward to 15%, and the operating income margin is projected to reach 27% by 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, Netflix anticipates 11-13% revenue growth and a 28% margin. Netflix's recent financial performance aligns with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's strong subscriber growth and better-than-expected financial results are reflected in its impressive market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Netflix has seen a remarkable 98.63% price total return over the past year, significantly outperforming the broader market. The company's robust financial health is further evidenced by its revenue growth of 13.0% in the last twelve months, with quarterly revenue growth accelerating to 16.76% in Q2 2024. This growth trajectory supports Netflix's position as a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. Another InvestingPro Tip notes that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.59. This suggests that despite the recent stock price appreciation, there may still be value for investors, aligning with Citi's maintained price target. For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Netflix, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Title: Nvidia facing a 'generational' opportunity, stock has nearly 40% upside left: BofA

Investing.com -- Bank of America analysts on Thursday reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and lifted the price target from $165 to $190, implying nearly 40% upside from current levels. BofA also hiked its 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 13% and 20%, respectively. The bank believes that Nvidia, which holds an 80-85% market share, is facing "generational opportunity" in a total addressable market (TAM) exceeding $400 billion, a significant jump from the current year's projections. Analysts said their bullish stance on the stock has been bolstered by several recent industry developments – TSMC’s recent blowout report, AMD’s AI event, and strong Blackwell demand, among others – as well as the company's robust competitive positioning. Moreover, they highlight Nvidia's underestimated enterprise partnerships with major firms like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as its software offerings. “NVDA’s engagements span multiple verticals, and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side,” they noted. BofA projects that Nvidia’s free cash flow (FCF) at 45-50% margin remains underappreciated, as it is nearly double the average of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech giants. “In $ terms, NVDA could take in $200bn+ of FCF over the next two years, rivaling that of AAPL and providing growth optionality,” analysts said. In its bull case scenario, BofA suggests that Nvidia could outperform expectations if the networking segment mix reaches 17-18%, driven by the ramp-up of its Spectrum switch and potential market share gains in Ethernet. This could conceptually lead to sales exceeding $200 billion in the fiscal year 2026. Furthermore, there is potential for gross margins to improve toward the mid-70% range, factoring in system mix shifts and better yields from the Blackwell product line.

Title: Meta layoffs are the latest sign that constant job cuts are the new Big Tech normal
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-job-cuts-indicate-tech-companies-like-recurring-layoffs-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:12:02Z
Full Content:
The hashtag affixed to Andy Welfle's LinkedIn photo says it all: #sickofthisshit. Welfle wrote earlier this month that he was laid off from Microsoft after only nine months. He'd previously spent nine months at Cruise before being laid off. His dual layoffs might have been worse than what many others experienced, but Welfle is hardly alone in getting hit by what appears to be some employers' penchant for regular layoffs, particularly in Silicon Valley. One of the latest examples is Meta, which said on Wednesday that it was rejiggering some of its biggest businesses, resulting in lost jobs at Instagram, Reality Labs, and WhatsApp. It wasn't clear how many roles were eliminated. A Meta spokesperson told Business Insider on Wednesday that the company was looking for other positions for affected workers. After shedding workers in sweeping layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023, many tech companies are taking a more methodical, department-by-department approach to making cuts. Major firms including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced sizable reductions followed by more modest trimming. Take Google. The tech giant's parent company, Alphabet, began 2023 by cutting some 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its workforce. It followed that with smaller reductions this year. Art Zeile, the CEO of the tech-career marketplace Dice, told BI that some of the biggest companies in the industry had determined that certain departments were no longer sufficiently profitable and that they needed to redirect resources to growth areas like artificial intelligence. "It is a shifting of bets," he said, adding that this routine trimming of jobs here and there is the new normal — for now. Unsurprisingly, even with growth in some areas, the drip-drip of reductions in the past couple of years appears to be making some tech workers nervous. In a June survey from Indeed that involved more than 1,100 US tech workers, 40% of respondents said they expected to be affected if their company conducted layoffs. Seven in 10 said they'd start looking to other employers if their company laid off workers. Linsey Fagan, a senior talent strategy advisor at Indeed, told BI that most of the recurring layoffs were in tech. That's likely because many companies in the industry grew quickly during the pandemic and are still adjusting. But those recurring cuts don't come without costs, Fagan said. "It's definitely not a sustainable strategy," she added. Fagan said employee sentiment starts to drop before a layoff as workers suspect cuts are coming. After the layoffs, workers' feelings about the company — and a CEO's acumen — take "a long-term dive," she said. "When you look at a business trying to come back from that — if they're continuously laying off, it simply can't happen," Fagan said. Even smaller-scale layoffs can make workers jittery, she said. Fagan added that the rise of technologies like generative AI and the threat of layoffs were pushing many in tech to build their skills. Tech workers looking for jobs on Indeed, she said, are now more likely to apply to staffing firms, which might offer temporary gigs, or to roles in areas like healthcare than to tech firms. Fagan said that while some tech workers are drawn to the flexibility that contingent or part-time roles can offer, tech has historically been the No. 1 industry tech workers want to work in. "They're just not feeling that stability right now," Fagan said. Some companies' penchant for regular nips and tucks could be a result of Wall Street's celebration of that type of trimming. At Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was "beautifully rewarded" by the market for making cuts, Zeile said, noting a rise in the company's stock price. Beyond what investors might cheer, the tech giants are getting older and no longer in growth mode, when their aim was often to snap up workers. Hence, many companies made cuts following the rush of hiring during the pandemic. Since then, some bosses have been looking to trim the size of their organization and otherwise make improvements. Zuckerberg famously declared that 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency." He also said the directive would become a feature, not a bug. Zeile predicted that investors would eventually look to tech companies to do more than boost profits by trimming costs and would want to see a return to growth. He said hiring would pick up broadly as companies find they have many areas in need of workers. A company like Meta might be cutting in some areas, but it's growing elsewhere, Zeile said. "Meta is actually on a tear right now," he said. "They're just no longer hiring VR engineers. They are hiring AI engineers, so they've actually boosted their hiring." Fagan said a sign that the tech industry might be closer to stabilizing was that, after declining for several years, job postings in areas like software development had remained flat in recent months, though they're still 30% below 2020 levels. Of course, that means there are fewer opportunities for laid-off workers. Still, she said, it's an indication that companies are being careful not to hire too many people. "It's not like they're going out and massively hiring and then doing layoffs," Fagan said. Welfle, who was laid off from Microsoft, wrote on LinkedIn that he was looking for a content-design role — maybe with a smaller company. He also said some of his feelings were similar to those he experienced after his layoff in December. "I'm having a hard time disentangling my sense of value and self-worth from my identity as a corporate worker," he said. "But I'll definitely be reflecting on that, and finding gentler, more sustainable ways to exist in a capitalist society."

Title: Learning to love nuclear power

Time Published: 2024-10-18T09:42:39Z
Full Content:
Good morning. It’s been an encouraging week for fans of nuclear power. Amazon announced investments in three “innovative nuclear energy projects,” alongside Citadel’s Ken Griffin, that should deliver five gigawatts of zero-carbon energy over the next 15 years. Google announced a partnership with Kairos Power, which it described as “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors.” And that’s just this week. Microsoft last month announced a partnership with the energy firm Constellation to reopen a nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island—yes, that Three Mile Island—to come online in 2028. Why the sudden nuclear renaissance? The energy needed to power data centers for AI is one reason. The need to reduce carbon emissions amid climate change is another. Public support for nuclear energy has been growing in recent years. While nuclear power is clean, nuclear fission, the process to produce it, uses radioactive materials that can cause deadly levels of radiation if released into the environment in an accident. I recently spoke with Patti Poppe, the CEO of California’s Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for the Leadership Next podcast that’s sponsored by Deloitte, which also supports this newsletter. Poppe has been focused on turning around the company’s operations, safety record, and culture, after PG&E’s culpability in the 2018 Camp wildfire put the utility into bankruptcy. Poppe believes the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is “an important part of the mix.” “The conversation has changed globally and here in the United States,” says Poppe. ‘I think the nation has realized that we can operate nuclear units safely, that, yes, it was scary in the seventies, but that is a long time ago. And we have realized that there are ways, just like with wildfire prevention, where we have a risk mitigation system in place at our nuclear power plant where we can fail safely.” What’s different is the emergence of small modular reactors or SMRs. Although versions have been around for years, the U.S. government and private corporations began making serious investments in developing them over the past decade. With their smaller and more flexible size, they can be quickly scaled up and adapted to a range of needs. But none are yet online in the U.S. and will need to clear regulatory approval. Bob Nardelli, the former Chrysler and Home Depot CEO, understands the landscape from his days at GE Power. Through his private-equity investment firm, X-LR8, Nardelli is now invested in BWX Technologies (BWXT), which makes a range of nuclear components and services. “I think it’s the solution for the future,” says Nardelli. “You don’t get line sag (sudden voltage drops), distribution loss, fires due to lightning hitting electrical lines and the life cycle is extradordinary.” More news below.

On Friday, Nomura/Instinet maintained a Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (2330:TT) (NYSE: TSM) stock, while increasing the price target to NT$1,400.00 from NT$1,355.00. The revised target comes after TSMC's recent analyst meeting where the company discussed its financial performance and outlook, particularly emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving demand. The semiconductor giant reported a robust gross margin (GM) for the third quarter of 2024, reaching 57.8%, and provided guidance for the fourth quarter GM to be between 57.0% and 59.0%. These figures exceeded market expectations and reinforced the belief that a GM above 55% could become the new standard for TSMC. This is attributed to favorable pricing dynamics and efficiency improvements from the capacity conversion of its advanced N5/3 technologies. TSMC's forecast for fourth-quarter 2024 revenue growth is set at 13% quarter-over-quarter, surpassing both the analyst's prior estimate of 10% and the buy-side consensus of 5-10%. In light of this, Nomura/Instinet has increased its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for TSMC for the years 2024 to 2026 by 2-3%. The price target adjustment is based on a 24x multiple of the forecasted 2025 EPS, which remains unchanged. The analyst underscored that TSMC's stock presents an attractive value at 18x/19x NMR/BBG 2025F EPS, noting it is trading at roughly a 20% discount compared to the SOX P/E ratio. The optimism is further bolstered by TSMC's guidance, which suggests that the impact of new overseas fabs on GM will be managed effectively, with only a 2-3 percentage point dilution expected in 2025. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has been the subject of positive analyst attention following strong third-quarter results. Both BofA Securities and UBS have raised their price targets for TSMC, with BofA setting it at NT$1,400 and UBS at NT$1,300, while maintaining their respective buy ratings. The upward revisions come after TSMC reported a third-quarter earnings per share of NT$12.54, surpassing market expectations by 8%. TSMC's third-quarter gross margin also made headlines, reaching 57.8%, higher than the company's guided range of 53.5-55.5%. This increase was attributed to higher utilization rates and cost improvements, particularly due to advancements in the 5/3 nanometer technologies. Additionally, TSMC has projected a gross margin expansion to 57.0-59.0% in the fourth quarter of 2024, exceeding previous expectations. Both BofA Securities and UBS are optimistic about TSMC's future, citing the company's leadership in the semiconductor industry and potential for continued growth. UBS projects TSMC's gross margin to further increase to 58.5% in 2025, considering factors such as a price increase on N5/3 technologies, improved utilization, and a decrease in N3 dilution. Moreover, TSMC reported a 12.8% sequential revenue increase to NT$23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024, driven by strong demand for 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies in smartphones and AI applications. The company also anticipates Q4 2024 revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion. These recent developments underline TSMC's robust financial performance and promising growth trajectory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, aligning with Nomura/Instinet's optimistic outlook. According to InvestingPro data, TSM's revenue growth remains robust, with a 22.65% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. This growth is even more pronounced on a quarterly basis, with Q3 2024 showing an impressive 38.95% revenue growth. The company's profitability metrics are equally compelling. TSM boasts a gross profit margin of 54.45% and an operating income margin of 42.04% for the last twelve months, reflecting its operational efficiency and pricing power in the semiconductor market. These figures support the analyst's view on TSMC's ability to maintain high gross margins. InvestingPro Tips highlight TSM's strong dividend performance, with a 42.34% dividend growth over the last twelve months. This, coupled with a current dividend yield of 0.95%, underscores the company's commitment to shareholder returns amid its growth trajectory. For investors seeking a deeper understanding of TSM's potential, InvestingPro offers 16 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: The one big bank that had a challenging week
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-one-big-bank-that-had-a-challenging-week-080029351.html
Time Published: 2024-10-18T08:00:29Z
Full Content:
Investors cheered earnings from many of the biggest banks this past week, with one notable exception: Citigroup. The stock of the nation’s third-largest lender fell 5% on the day of its third quarter earnings announcement despite beating expectations and showing revenue growth across all five of its divisions. Through Thursday’s close it was up just 0.8% for the week, while other big-bank rivals from Bank of America (BAC) to Morgan Stanley (MS) churned considerably higher on renewed optimism about the industry. A big reason for Citigroup’s challenging week was the confusion that took hold during an exchange CEO Jane Fraser had with analysts on Citigroup’s earnings call Tuesday. It happened when Fraser did not immediately refute a question from analyst Mike Mayo about whether regulators had placed a new asset-cap restraint on Citigroup. After the bank’s stock fell, she later returned to the subject and tried to end the speculation about any new regulatory handcuffs. "Let me be crystal clear: We do not have an asset cap, and there are no additional measures,” Fraser said. “And not expecting any,” she added. The exchange was a reminder of the pitfalls facing Citigroup as it tries to convince investors that it has its compliance problems under control and that regulatory scrutiny won’t interfere with a multiyear transformation of the company that began last year under Fraser. The questions from analysts about the possibility of new constraints were spurred in part by a letter that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) sent earlier this month to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The senator urged the bank regulator to impose new growth restrictions on Citigroup and consider forcing a breakup if it doesn't adequately reform its long-troubled risk management and internal controls systems. "It may be time to break up Citi," she said in the letter. The idea of growth restrictions is a reference to a so-called asset cap that sets a ceiling on how big a bank can get until it satisfies regulators that any outstanding concerns have been resolved. Such a growth restriction was imposed on the US retail operations of Canadian bank Toronto Dominion (TD) last week after it pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering regulations. Wells Fargo (WFC) has also been operating under an asset cap since 2018. It was imposed after a federal investigation uncovered millions of bank and credit card accounts that were opened for customers without their knowledge to meet sales goals. Citigroup is certainly no stranger to challenges with regulators, even recently. In July, its overseers hit the bank with $136 million in fines for failing to make sufficient progress on consent orders imposed by the Federal Reserve and the OCC in 2020. Earlier in the summer, regulators also found weaknesses in Citigroup’s "living will." There have been signs of some progress on old problems too. Earlier this month, the Fed said it had ended a decade-old enforcement action it filed against Citigroup in 2013 relating to anti-money-laundering policies. What Mayo wanted to know on the Tuesday conference call with bank management was whether Citigroup can bring down its expenses while investing in regulatory, compliance, and data initiatives the bank needs to escape the 2020 consent orders — and whether it has or is facing the "asset cap." CFO Mark Mason tackled the questions first. He pointed out that the bank has said it plans to cut its expenses from $53.8 billion to a range of $51 to $53 billion in 2026. That cost reduction is predicated on Citigroup being able to unwind certain international business units in addition to reducing its headcount. "​​Will there be headwinds? Yes," said Mason, referencing the bank's multiyear transformation effort. "We're also investing in risk and controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations,” he added. Fraser discussed how Citigroup was "focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure, risk, and controls, and all of that reduces risk as we go" but didn't directly address the asset cap. Mayo followed up by asking if Citigroup's regulatory issues were a client or internal problem and asked more about a possible asset cap. "We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback, as well as our own lessons learned if we fall behind in an element of the consent orders," said Fraser. "So I feel very comfortable." It wasn’t until Fraser was asked a third time about an asset cap 30 minutes after the initial question that she shut down the speculation. "There was a bit of a pause and then some apparent confusion among investors before management was able to clarify unequivocally that there is no asset cap and that there are no additional restrictions beyond what has already been disclosed," Piper Sandler analyst Scott Siefers said a note. Siefers didn’t change his $73 price target for Citigroup next year. Citigroup’s third quarter results did beat expectations and its Wall Street unit did well as dealmaking optimism surged. But the bank's profits and net interest income both fell from a year earlier. Some investors may still be worried about a critical measure of Citigroup’s transformation plan under Fraser: a profitability metric known as ROTCE (return on tangible common equity). For its third quarter Citigroup posted a 7% ROTCE, down from 7.2% last quarter and far from the 11% to 12% it has vowed to reach in 2026. "Slogging along at a ~7% ROTCE, there's no question that Citi is a laggard and thus a suitable punching bag for shorts,” said a note from Oppenheimer, which lowered its price target by $1 to $91. "That said, we think that Fraser and Mason have gotten expectations to where they can confidently beat them." Other analysts also offered some optimism. "Despite the increased regulatory overhang on the stock in recent months, we note the progress that management continues to make in order to boost franchise profitability," Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala said in a Wednesday research note, pointing to Citi's improving wealth unit. Even Mayo, who was the first to ask this week about an asset cap, had some nice things to say afterward. "Management's comments should put this issue to rest barring some unforeseen event," he said in a Tuesday research note following the call. Wells Fargo analysts currently expect Citigroup to achieve a 10% ROTCE target in 2026, and Mayo said he still thinks Citigroup can get there. "Buy! Especially If You Left Before the End of the 3Q24 Call!!" he wrote. David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.

Title: My Favorite Tools For Working From Home
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/omaidhomayun/2024/10/18/my-favorite-tools-for-working-from-home/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T05:32:14Z
Full Content:
Zody II by Haworth Most people under invest in their office chair while working from home. It’s likely the most important piece of furniture that will determine how you feel physically and if ergonomic — will help you avoid things like future back pain. The best piece of advice I received was to always try a chair in person to make sure it’s the right fit for you. What I love about the Zody II by Haworth is that it’s the perfect cross between form and function. Because of back pain, my chiropractor recommends that I stand every 30 minutes which means I have to lift my desk to use it as a standing desk. The Zody II has a perch function (dual posture configuration) where you can raise it high enough and you can use the forward tilt feature which allows your seat to slope forward so you can extend your legs. Haworth has coined it forward tilt adjustment, if you ensure your configuration includes it you wont’ regret it. Additional ergonomic features include being able to adjust your seat depth and lumbar support. I’ve found myself adjusting the arm height frequently depending on if I’m actively typing or just listening in a Zoom meeting to take relief off my shoulders. Depending on preference, you can move the arms inward or outward which I often find myself adjusting as well. The Zody II includes other features which you’d expect in premium chair like easily adjusting the tension and seat height. What’s also fun is that you can customize things like color and fabric to truly make it your own. While the Zody II carries a premium price tag (which can depend on configuration), Haworth recently introduced the Breck chair which nails all ergonomic requirements without breaking the bank. Sitting in Breck feels responsive and you can adjust height and seat depth easily. They’ve designed the lumbar support to be easily adjusted and overall it’s more comfortable than most office chairs I’ve sat in over the years. Breck Office Chair Many companies provide an office stipend and if you can get your work to cover this expense it’s a great value for chair with a 12-year warranty for around $500. Purchasing can be a personal decision, like buying a mattress. Sometimes you need to try it out for a while or even a couple of visits to feel comfortable in your decision. As was told to me, try the chairs in person if you can as Haworth as a dealer locater available on their website. One of the most versatile pieces of furniture I’ve used comes from a company called Joybird. Buying nice furniture online can feel like a gamble, thankfully they have showrooms in major cities across the country. While it can naturally be used as a bedroom dresser, I prefer to use it as office storage in my living room. Fenton Chest What surprised me most was the quality of the Fenton Chest which is made with solid Acacia and engineered wood with walnut veneers. It feels well crafted and is made to last. It also arrived put together which is a huge plus. It’s also a nice touch that the top drawer is lined with a felt base. I solicited Gifty Walker, Director of Merchandising at Joybird, about what pieces of furniture people should consider when building their home office from scratch. “Since I personally need my home office to double as a guest room, I would first build around a sleeper sofa. My top picks are our Briar or Miller Sleeper Sofa. From there, I’d go with our Carver Desk. It’s the perfect size and it has drawers to keep things organized and out of sight for when you have guests over. To complete the room, I’d select the Monroe Floor Lamp that gives just the right amount of lighting for ambiance and video calls, while the machine washable Radha Rug helps tie your space together. Plus, the rug is a breeze to clean.” Gifty mentioned that storage is often one of the aspects often overlooked. She suggests considering a desk with built-in storage or a secondary furniture piece like a console cabinet to maximize space. I have a standing desk that has a small drawer so I can appreciate more storage especially within arms reach. While Joybird is rooted in Mid-Century style and bold colors, they’ve adapted to color trends like whites and neutral palettes. Another strong differentiator is that Joybird actually manufactures all of their customizable upholstery pieces. You can see their unique design embedded into much of their furniture pieces as they cover everything from home office to dining room and even decor pieces. “Where does the inspiration come from?” I asked. “When it comes to interior design, inspiration can be found anywhere. We spend time at trade and design shows that give us glimpses into what’s coming. Since design is not solely about aesthetics, but it is also about function and utility, we may see something that could be amazing but not resonate with our customer so we’ll modify based on what customers have shown interest in through sales. Interior trends and colors specifically often follow the fashion industry so we will keep a pulse on that. Other great sources are architecture design and nature. Think about the doorway arches and now we’ve seen that become a trend when it comes to rounded edges over clean and sharp corners. Green is often a top design color because it provides the same calming effects of being in nature,” Gifty explained. Perhaps my biggest takeaway from Gifty is that we often have to think about multi-functional spaces instead of the traditional dedicated office with traditional furniture. She said this shows up as a guest room and office combination and we need the right pieces like a sleeper sofa to fit the room’s needs from day to night. It’s a great reminder to question furniture purchases with function in mind. One of the significant changes I’ve made is my wardrobe. I don’t want to wear jeans at home because they’re not exactly comfortable, but I also don’t feel the best version of myself when I’m wearing sweatpants while I’m working. Men's Everywhere Pant Cozy Earth is widely known for their super soft bedding and they’ve extended their line into clothing. The Men’s Everywhere Pant is just that — I can wear them all day at work and run out for errands while being comfortable and never feeling like I have to change. They pair nicely with their Everyday Polo and unlike every other polo I’ve owned they don’t shrink after washing them (ideally cold water and hang drying). Working from home has motivated me to cook more. I’ve picked up the hobby of batch juicing and even bake bread for the family. I’ve used Caraway pots and pans for a few years and naturally learning how to use stainless steel was my next step as it’s generally a safe option to avoid toxins in your food. However, there is a bit of a learning curve. Stainless Steel Cookware Set You can be captivated by the colors and appearance of the Caraway lineup and I’ve found their Stainless Steel Cookware Set to deliver on that same promise. Stainless steel is designed to have more heat retention than non-stick pans. When used properly, your food should not stick to the pan. One of my favorite Caraway pieces is their dutch oven. As you may know, not all dutch ovens are created equal because the way one cooks may be slightly different from another. I’ve made braised short ribs thanks to YouTube chef Alison Roman to perfection with their dutch oven. Their stainless steel set, however, comes generously with four pieces and a nicely sized 10.5’’ frying pan which I find myself using most often — especially to make a quick and healthy piece of salmon. The pan storage unit it comes with has been very helpful for organization and since they’re stacked horizontally it prevents them from scratching one another. While it’s an investment in the stainless steel set, it seems built to last like my previous Caraway set. Over the last few years I’ve continued to tweak and optimize my home office and desk setup. There are two lights I’ve come across that have been very unique and could be useful depending on your needs. As someone who has a standing desk and attempts to minimize clutter in my office space, I have numerous mounts from Elgato that have been invaluable. The mounts themselves have eliminated the need for two tripods around my desk. I also used to have a key light which was my main source of light on myself along with a massive light box hanging above my desk. It’s a big space commitment for this type of lighting and it doesn’t look conducive if you’re trying to use the space for other things. Elgato Key Light Air Elgato makes a number of light sources, but what I like about their Key Light Air is that it’s an edge-lit LED panel with a small footprint that packs a big punch in terms of lighting. They come with very solid stands, but once again I use their Master Mount L to clamp both lights at the edges of my desk. I was skeptical about how much light these would produce, given their name “Air” and comparing them to the other models with larger LED panels. However, I can tell you I often have them in the 5-10% range of brightness and it’s plenty lit. The one thing to note is that they are controlled through the Elgato app. That means after pairing the lights you have to use the app to turn them on or change the brightness and color temperature. I haven’t had any major issues and it seems to work well most of the time. Once in a blue moon it will take an app refresh for both lights to connect. They have an on and off switch behind the panel, but it would be a nice touch if you could modify the brightness with a physical button. Just something to consider if you feel like you prefer a physical switch on a light. Dyson’s floor lamp is called the Solarcycle Morph and it definitely looks like something out of this world. There are many things that are unique about it but one of the benefits I appreciate is that is serves a dual purpose. You can extend the light out to shine directly or you can magnetically snap the light back into the tall cylinder and it creates an ambient light. The ambient light is perfect for reading, relaxing, and it’s the perfect lighting for the background of a Zoom call. Dyson Solarcycle Morph The Solarcycle has physical buttons and you can control the same settings through the Dyson app. The light also has a USB-C charging port on bottom, a feature I have not used often but it’s a convenience for some. Dyson offers a desktop model but I prefer the floor lamp if you have the space for it. Dyson is widely known for their vacuums and other beautifully designed items like cooling fans. One thing that’s important to me is saving space. They have a product that acts as both a cooling system, heater, and an air purifier called the Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde purifying fan heater. It’s a mouthful but deservedly so because it has three functions in one so I don’t need a fan, space heater, and air purifier. While I have all of those products separately, I’ve been able to put them in storage for now. The same Dyson app will pair with both the light and the purifying fan heater which is convenient. I mentioned batch juicing. One of the staples in my kitchen over the last year has been the Nama J2 juicer. It’s newest addition, the J3, is equally impressive. J3 Cold Press Juicer Because of the chambers that slow juice, it saves time because you can cut fruits and vegetables as you go and then put them inside. If you have children who like to help, it makes juicing fun because they get to watch the fruits swirl around as they begin to go down the chamber. Cleaning up takes about five minutes as you should hand wash and dry when you can to avoid any stains on the juicer itself. While I’ve made many batches of juice with it’s predecessor, the J3 yields about 16 oz of juice which is half as much as the J2. It also has a smaller sized base which makes it a great option for apartment living or if you like to travel with your juicer. If you plan to drink your juice right away it might make sense to consider J3. Performance wise they have the same motor (50 rpm). One thing I’d recommend, whether you use a Nama juicer or an alternative — find at least one recipe book that will inspire you to try new recipes. I typically make two juices per week. One being the green juice staple, and the other will either will be a rotating recipe or something completely new depending on what’s in season. As you cook more in the kitchen you have a need for different types of knives. As an adult, the only real knife I purchased was a Togiharu from Blue Apron that I broke in half inside of a watermelon. It was probably my fault, however, there are two brothers — Jared and Jordan, who have reinvented this houseware category. So much so that I can’t take a trip Costco without noticing one of their beautiful sets of knives. Cutlery Knife Set Admittedly, I’ve also bought knives that come in a pack of three from Bed Bath & Beyond and they ended up in the garbage within a few months. These knives are built to last as they’re made with German stainless steel. I always hand wash them and try to dry them right away and the condition of them remains outstanding. You can invest $150 in a set of knives that will probably last you at least a decade or more. The sets typically come with a small manual that tells you exactly what each knife is for — and honestly I’ve misplaced mine. Nonetheless — the chef’s knife works flawlessly. The bread knife works as advertised, and whether you’re cutting through a watermelon or a steak you’ll feel like you’re using a thousand dollar knife. What’s nice about their knife blocks is that you can keep them up and away from the kids rather than having them easily accessible in a drawer. I highly recommend it if you have little ones roaming around the kitchen. Another office solution that I wish I discovered years ago is the combination of the monitor arm by Humanscale along with their M/Connect 3 and Pro Dock. It’s given my desk plenty more room because I can put away my clunky stand that came with my Lenovo monitor. The arm is one of the most ergonomic inventions on the market. I used to use one from Fully (now Herman Miller) — but the Humanscale design and functionality makes it the iPhone of monitor arms. It’s beautiful and minimalistic. I also use my monitor as a movie screen and I can easier bring it forward with no hassle. What’s even more interesting is the hub on bottom. One of the biggest issues with a monitor that is also designed as a docking station is that all of your wires and connections hang from the monitor. I have an 8-inch hub literally hanging off the side of my monitor which is an eye sore. M/Connect 3 with monitor arm Taking a look under the hood, there’s an actual dock that sits below your desk — out of sight. In other words, you get the benefits of the minimalistic space saving design with the additional USB and USB-C charging ports, as well as the entire hub clamped under your desk (see below). M/Connect 3 with Pro Dock Unless you need your monitor stand and have a docking solution you’re in love with, I can’t think of a cleaner and more efficient setup. I know many people like to have a dual monitor, so you can pick and choose which type of monitor arm makes the most sense for you. You can also decide on three colors in terms of the Pro Dock that suites your color scheme. My standing desk has white legs so I prefer the white dock. Set aside 30 minutes to setup your monitor arm and docking station and you should be in business. Humanscale’s Vice President of Product Management, Mark Consolla, shared how your home office setup can support your overall health and productivity. "An ergonomic home office setup is essential for maximizing both your health and productivity. With more people working remotely, it's critical that workstations at the home are designed to support comfort and well-being. Our M2.1 monitor arm, with its easy-to-assemble and dynamically configurable design, helps users achieve an optimal ergonomic position, reducing strain and promoting better posture throughout the day. By investing in tools like the M2.1, professionals can enhance both their efficiency and their long-term health wherever they work." One of the tech gadgets I’ve found myself using most over the last few months is a device from Courant called the MAG:2 Classics. Essentially, it magnetically connects to my iPhone and serves a dual purpose. It’s a charger and a phone stand in one — as well as having a place to charge your AirPods on the base as well. I’m a fan of the brown leather look while they also have a linen option. MAG:2 Classics I find myself carrying it around with me much of the day. It’ll be at my desk when I’m working. In the kitchen if I’m cooking or washing dishes so I can watch YouTube clips. I’ve also used it to play workout videos because it serves as the perfect stand. It has a non-slip construction so you can use it almost anywhere. MAG:3 Classics Courant also makes a charging catch trays, one which they’ve coined the MAG:3 Classics. It has the MagSafe capability so your iPhone and AirPods will connect and charge very easily. I have it by my bedside and use it daily. I also don’t want to scratch the wood on my nightstand which is another reason why I keep it there for protection. One of the staples for any office space is an area rug, unless you’re in a carpeted room of course. Ensuring that you have a run on hardwood floors will also help with your sound quality as you want furniture and things to fill the room to avoid an echo. I searched high and low for a contemporary rug that’s easy to clean and I kept coming across a company called Revival. Their Shell rug was exactly what I was looking for. It’s very soft on your feet and easy to vacuum. Some rugs are insanely heavy. This was folded and packaged nicely, and it was light enough for me to carry around by myself. This specific rug comes in 4 color and 11 different sizing options. Always be sure to have a rug pad underneath because it will feel nicer and provide your rug with longevity. Shell washable rug I solicited Ben Hyman, co-founder and CEO of Revival about the inspiration behind the Shell rug. “We wanted to make a machine-washable rug that didn’t read as washable, but instead looked and felt as thick and soft as a standard hand-knotted rug. It was important to us to use recycled materials. The look of the collection was inspired by the accidental designs you find on the beach, made by waves on sand.” Revival is most known at the intersection between quality, design, variety, and affordability. However, buying a rug online is difficult. While it’s not exactly like buying a mattress — people often want to see and experience the rug in person before making the commitment. I asked Hyman how they’ve tried to make that experience more seamless for the customer. “Since the beginning we’ve invested heavily in our photography and descriptions to make sure we’re conveying all the important details about each rug. We have impeccable customer service, well-designed boxes, free shipping, complimentary interior design consultations, an augmented reality tool that lets you view your rug in your room, and a swatch program, so you can order samples of our bestselling rugs before you buy. We’re also constantly investing in the digital user experience on our website so that the experience feels intuitive and snappy. Collectively, these features make Revival a special place to shop.” Some people prefer a wool rug but they’re often very expensive. Typically, you have to take them to a rug cleaner which you have to take into consideration when it comes to the lifetime cost of the rug. Hyman and his global team have leveraged having a presence in places like Casablanca and Istanbul because it gives them access to local artisans. They’ve also somehow made wool rugs that are washable. “We’re proud of the R&D we’ve done around rug utility and sustainability, without compromising design. This focus on construction and materiality has resulted in products like our washable wool Lino and Helen rugs.” The team at Revival has kept their pulse on the market over the last few years, adapting to the needs of customers. “We started off as a purveyor of vintage rugs, a small niche within the much broader rug category. Early on we realized we needed to find a way to offer customers more than vintage; that it was important they have access to a wider range of time periods, including contemporary. Within a few years of producing new rugs it became clear customers were looking for washables, which has become a huge part of our business. it’s been a gradual evolution,” Hyman explained. While the pandemic wasn’t exactly an accelerator like it was for many e-commerce companies — there was a silver living for the team at Revival. “In 2020 we launched items like other textiles and furniture on the site. Yet we struggled to find our footing from both an operational and marketing perspective in these other categories, as we spread our small team too thin. In 2022 we came full circle, pivoting back to a more exclusive focus on rugs, and expanding our offering further in that category. This additional focus on high-quality, affordable rugs sets us apart; it took a while – and some missteps – to get there.” This led to them eventually establishing a significant inventory in the US so that stock issues wouldn’t hold them back, and rugs could ship out to their customers in 2-3 days. As we concluded our interview, I solicited Hyman for the best piece of advice he’d give someone shopping for a rug. “First — measure your room. Second — buy a rug pad. These two surprisingly simple things will make a huge difference in how good your rug looks.” One of the habits I’ve broken (in a good way) is buying coffee out and it’s saved a lot of money. I typically make tea at home but one thing that becomes frustrating is that my tea is either too hot or too cold. Enter the Ember Mug 2. Ember Mug 2 To admit, I was skeptical at first. However, when I keep the tea temperature at 145 degrees it’s just right — and the Mug 2 can keep that temperature for 80 minutes off the charger. The temperature can be controlled through their app and the design and color options are sleek. I do wish, however, they made an even larger option than 14 oz. It’s definitely big enough to function well but I am a fan of large mugs. I’ve also found and tested a $13 mug warmer from a local grocery store and it did the job, but you have to keep it on your desk or within reach. That’s a nice touch with the Mug 2 is that you can keep the charger in the kitchen and not have to worry about more clutter on your desk. I’m often looking for ways to save time and one tool that’s been helpful is the robotic pool cleaner by Polaris, specifically the FREEDOM Plus model. FREEDOM Plus Overall, using a robotic cleaner has saved me nearly 8 hours per month of manually scrubbing the pool and I don’t get the lactic acid and soreness built up in my shoulders and arms. Also, robotic cleaners use less energy because you don’t have to rely on the pool’s filtration system as often. I appreciated how lightweight thee FREEDOM Plus is because it makes it very portable. The inclusion of a charger stand with wheels makes it even more portable and convenient. The cordless feature is a notable advantage, as it eliminates the risk of entanglement and allows for uninterrupted use of the pool while the device is operational. This is a substantial improvement over traditional corded pool cleaners, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. While most robotic cleaners come with a hefty price tag it’s definitely worth exploring so you can save more time and invest that elsewhere. An important tip I learned from a course I took on setting up a home studio is the importance of plants in your Zoom background. It plays a significant role in how people perceive your office. One of the keys is to use artificial plants because you will always have a consistent look compared to a real plant that changes shape every so often. One of the biggest drawbacks to real plants is that there is often more work involved than meets the eye. You can’t just “set it and forget it.” Most plants need to be in sunlight and if they have issues you have to troubleshoot the humidity in your office and a plethora of other things that become more work. If you are a plant enthusiast that is another story. Artificial Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree with Artisan Planter CG Hunter is a company who makes artificial plants and trees. I’ve traversed every craft store that carries artificial plants and CG Hunter’s quality is in another stratosphere. I initially came across some of their trees at Costco was floored because I thought they were real. What are the benefits of an artificial tree versus a real one? I asked an executive at CG Hunter. “Faux plants and trees bring the beauty of nature into the home or office without the maintenance. They provide the lush vibrancy of real plants without the need for watering or sunlight, making them perfect for spaces with low light. With their low maintenance and long-lasting durability, they offer a cost-effective way to enhance any space without the need for ongoing care. Artificial plants are also pet friendly.” I solicited them for any additional considerations. “It is important to consider scale when buying faux trees as you want to use them to deliver height or fullness and dimension as well as texture, color, and pattern. Carefully selected faux trees and plants can be used to hide unsightly plugs or cords other blemishes in a room.” It’s so true. If you use a standing desk, you want to be mindful about how your plants and trees are visible in the background depending on whether you sit or stand. My chiropractor recommended I stand every 30 minutes — so I’m always keeping that in mind. For example, if my plant is too short and I lift my desk then it may be out of sight. I’ve found it helpful to turn on a Zoom meeting, setup your background, and look at your monitor to see what the other people would see. One other pro tip is to have the plan partially in your shot because it makes the length and size of the room feel larger than it may be in real life. close up of Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree One thing I like about the Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree (pictured above) is the thickness of the leaves. If you are using a high quality web cam or a mirrorless camera for Zoom, you want to have a slight blur in the background. Not the kind of blur Zoom offers because your room is messy — I mean the slight blur that you see on a quality video podcast. Thicker greenery will often pop in your picture. As you can see the texture of the trees from CG Hunter truly come alive. Most importantly you have to test things out in your environment and see what works for you based on what look you are trying to achieve. Lastly, one of my favorite items that I’ve used to and from the office and coffee shops is my Briggs & Riley backpack. What I love most about it is that it doesn’t slouch over like most brands. You can sit it on the floor or next to your desk and it keeps shape. The design is thoughtful and intentional, and it has every compartment you would need — even for a quick flight. It always serves as my carry-on when I travel. Medium Cargo Backpack Like their timeless luggage, the backpack just works and it matches just about any wardrobe. What also makes Briggs & Riley stand out is their customer service. I’ve had luggage have issues in the past because the airline slammed them during transport and Briggs & Riley has fixed them with their lifetime warranty. They’ve also nailed the intersection of quality and price with unique products that last a liftetime. My previous favorite shoe that was easy to put on and incredibly comfortable was the Hupana Flow by HOKA. While they have discontinued the model, what I like about the Transport shoe is that have the quick-toggle laces where you don’t have to tie your shoes. You can just pull up the tongue and slip your feet in and go. HOKA is widely known for making the most comfortable shoes and this model delivers on that promise. Men's Transport shoe in Alabaster / Varsity Navy They’re also treated with a topical water repellent agent that make them a go-to for light drizzle. What I’ve found is that the further you go towards a rainboot, the less comfortable shoes can be. The Vibram outsole, which can be found on other models, makes it especially nice for the elements. So far these have been very comfortable and I’m glad they come in a wide option. Personally, I like to limit clutter around the front door so there are usually two pairs of shoes there. One for working out and another for running errands. I probably won’t throw away my Hupanas until there are more holes in them, but I’m optimistic the Transports will replace them in the near future.

Title: Watch These Netflix Price Levels After Q3 Earnings Drive Stock Higher
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-netflix-price-levels-after-q3-earnings-drive-stock-higher-8730210

Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the streaming giant topped Wall Street’s third-quarter estimates and issued a strong revenue outlook. During the quarter, Netflix added 5.1 million subscribers, surpassing expectations of 5 million, though the company has shifted its focus to revenue and profit margins as its business model matures. The company said it’s targeting an operating profit margin of 28% next year compared to its 27% goal this year, adding that its sees ample room to increase its margins over the long term. Netflix shares have gained more than 41% this year prior to Thursday’s after-hours pop as investors cheer the company’s ongoing efforts to expand its advertising business and offer more live streaming events. Below, we’ll break down the technicals on the Netflix chart and identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching out for. Netflix shares have traded within a rising wedge since late June, with the price recently retracing to the pattern’s lower trendline and 50-day moving average (MA). Importantly, the stock on Thursday also registered its largest day of volume since mid-July, indicating portfolio repositioning ahead of the streaming giant’s quarterly results. Given the stock’s expected earnings-driven jump, let’s look at several key overhead price levels that may come into focus and also point out two key support areas where the shares may attract buying interest during pullbacks. Firstly, investors should eye the $735 level, an area on the chart where the shares could run into selling pressure near the rising wedge pattern’s upper trendline. This trendline has provided resistance on two separate occasions since late September. To project a price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance of the rising wedge near its widest point and adding that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $125 to $735, which projects an upside target of $860. If a post-earnings rally fades, investors should initially monitor the $688 level. The stock could attract support in this area near the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, which also corresponds with a range of similar trading levels within the pattern. A decisive breakdown below the wedge’s lower trendline opens the door for a decline to around $635, a level on the chart where investors may seek entry points near consolidation periods on the chart in April, May, and June, with the closely watched 200-day MA also positioned nearby.

Title: TSMC Says It Will Take “Prompt Action” If Found In Violation of Huawei Sanctions

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has assured that it is committed to complying with all regulations that prohibit it from selling chips to and having business dealings with Chinese technology giant Huawei. Huawei is forbidden by US law to acquire high end chips that are manufactured using US origin technologies, and TSMC's comments came in response to a report that claimed that the firm was being investigated by the US for having ties to Huawei. The purported investigation is being headed by the Commerce Department, and it covers TSMC's artificial intelligence and smartphone chips. TSMC's statement comes after a paywalled report in The Information which had claimed that the Commerce Department was investigating TSMC for having supplied Huawei with chips used in either smartphones or artificial intelligence systems. Huawei's smartphone chips have been heavily scrutinized since US sanctions in 2020 stopped TSMC from selling the most advanced products to the company. For instance, TSMC cannot sell chips made through 7 nanometer or lower process technology nodes to Huawei, and with Huawei's competitors such as Apple now using 3 nanometer chips in their smartphones, the restrictions have dealt a sizable competitive blow to the firm due to its work with the Chinese government. The rise of AI has further increased the scrutiny of advanced processor shipments worldwide. These have led to NVIDIA facing US restrictions for selling some products to Huawei, and they have also increased China's efforts to develop its local AI ecosystem to reduce reliance on Western technology. In response, TSMC has stressed that it "is a law abiding company," adding that "we are committed to complying with all applicable regulations." TSMC states that if is has "any reason to believe there are issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance." With the surging demand for AI processors helping TSMC to recover from a slump in the consumer electronics industry, any violations of US law could create complications for the global semiconductor industry. Since TSMC supplies most of the chips made on order worldwide, legal and regulatory complications might restrict its access to advanced chip manufacturing equipment. This in turn could force firms to diversify their chip manufacturing supply chains. TSMC's sizable presence in Taiwan and the region's geopolitical tussles with China have also created unease in chip companies about the threat of supply chain disruption in case of conflict in the South China Sea. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang remarked last month that his firm's chip design capabilities allow it to shift away from TSMC in the worst case scenario since NVIDIA designs "diversity and redundancy into every aspect wherever we can. And then the last part of it, is, to have enough intellectual property in our company in the event that we have to shift from one fab to another, we have the ability to do it." TAIWAN SEMI $TSM RESPONSE: “TSMC IS A LAW-ABIDING COMPANY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. IF WE HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THERE ARE ISSUES, WE WILL TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.” https://t.co/H3oGDj0D6w — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 18, 2024 Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Jennifer Newstead, Chief Legal Officer of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently sold 905 shares of the company's Class A Common Stock, amounting to a total transaction value of $533,922. The shares were sold at a price of $589.97 each. Following this transaction, Newstead holds 33,292 shares directly. The sale was conducted under a pre-arranged trading plan established on November 30, 2023. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen several financial firms, including TD Cowen and Mizuho Securities, raise their price targets on the company's shares, underlining an optimistic outlook for the firm's revenue growth. TD Cowen, in particular, expects Meta's revenue to grow by 19% year-over-year in the third quarter, attributing this anticipated rise to enhanced user engagement and better monetization of video content. The company has also been making strategic adjustments affecting Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs teams, with some employees being relocated and others reassigned. In addition, Mizuho Securities has highlighted the additional revenue potential stemming from political advertising and the significant potential in Meta's messaging services and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) for creative purposes. Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta, suggesting continued aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. However, Meta has also been ordered to face lawsuits alleging that its social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. These recent developments underscore the dynamic and evolving landscape in which Meta is operating. While Jennifer Newstead's recent stock sale might raise eyebrows, it's crucial to view this transaction within the broader context of Meta Platforms' financial performance and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a substantial market capitalization of $1.46 trillion, underscoring its status as a tech giant. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 24.28% increase over the last twelve months, reaching $149.78 billion. Meta's financial health appears strong, as evidenced by two key InvestingPro Tips. First, the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a solid financial foundation. Second, Meta demonstrates "impressive gross profit margins," which stood at 81.49% for the last twelve months. These factors suggest that despite executive stock sales, the company's underlying business fundamentals remain sound. It's worth noting that Meta's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a one-year price total return of 78.6%. This aligns with another InvestingPro Tip highlighting Meta's "high return over the last year." For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into Meta's financial outlook and market position.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Health Insurers Slide as Elevance Cites Medicaid Declines

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed as earnings results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) helped revitalize optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and September retail sales data came in ahead of forecasts. After trading higher for most of the session and posting an all-time intraday high, the S&P 500 lost steam in the afternoon to close the session less than 0.1% lower. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal gain of less than 0.1%, while the Dow added 0.4% to print its second straight record close. Health insurer shares moved lower after industry player Elevance Health (ELV) missed profit estimates with its third-quarter results and lowered its guidance for the full year. The company attributed the shortfall to declines in Medicaid enrollments stemming from eligibility redeterminations and other changes. Elevance shares dropped 10.6%, while losses spread to other health insurance stocks with Medicaid exposure. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) plunged 12.6%, the steepest drop in the S&P 500, while Centene (CNC) stock lost 9.1%. CSX (CSX) shares tumbled 6.7% after the freight shipper's quarterly sales and profits fell short of analysts' expectations. Hurricanes Helene and Milton weighed on the company's results, while a decline in coal revenue and lower fuel charges also restrained revenues. Shares of Snap-On (SNA), a provider of tools and equipment for professional users across various industries, soared 10.0% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500. The gains came after Snap-On released its third-quarter financial results, matching analysts' revenue forecasts but exceeding earnings per share (EPS) expectations. In its largest segment, which sells tools and services to auto repair shops, Snap-On posted 4% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, suggesting a potential turnaround in that key market. The Travelers Companies (TRV) shares surged 9.0% following the insurer's third-quarter earnings report. Despite a year-over-year uptick in catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Helene and other severe weather events, Travelers more than tripled its net income compared with the year-ago period, boosted by higher premiums and increased investment income. The company also reported an improvement in its consolidated combined ratio—a key gauge of profitability for insurance companies. Investment management firm Blackstone (BX) reported better-than-expected profits alongside an increase in assets under management for the third quarter, and its shares jumped 6.3%. Blackstone's CEO noted that the firm invested or committed more than $54 billion during the quarter—the highest amount in more than two years. Blackstone's overall fund appreciation during the quarter also reached its strongest level in three years.

Title: Microsoft Stock Earnings: Is It A Buy Before Or After Reporting?

Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report its earnings soon, and investors are keen to see if the tech giant will continue its trend of strong financial performance. With consistent earnings beats in recent quarters and steady stock price growth, it’s worth asking if now is the right time to buy before or after the company’s earnings report. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s historical earnings, recent performance and factors to consider ahead of its report. Over the past eight quarters, Microsoft has demonstrated impressive earnings performance, beating estimates every time for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, except for a single revenue miss. The company has consistently surprised to the upside, with significant EPS beats like 12.9% in first-quarter 2024 and a notable revenue beat of nearly $2 billion during the same period. The strength in Microsoft’s earnings history highlights a pattern of outperforming market expectations, building investor confidence in its financial reliability. These consistent surprises, including a 5.8% EPS beat in fiscal second-quarter 2024, suggest that Microsoft’s earnings reports tend to favorably surprise analysts, which could be a signal for bullish investors looking for an edge. Microsoft’s stock performance has been solid despite market volatility. In the past month, MSFT stock has seen a slight dip of 4.4%, but year to date, it remains up by 12.2%. Over the past year, the stock has gained 25.3%, reflecting its resilience and growth. Microsoft’s five-year performance is remarkable, boasting a 202.8% increase. If Microsoft continues its growth trajectory, discussions around whether Microsoft stock can reach $1,000 could gain traction. Analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus recommendation to buy and a price target range from $420 to $600, well above the current share price of $418.74. This aligns with Microsoft’s strong business fundamentals, including a gross margin of 69.8% and an impressive operating margin of 44.6%.

Before diving into the specifics of the earnings, it's crucial to consider various factors that could impact Microsoft's performance. Economic conditions, competitive pressures and evolving market dynamics all play a significant role in shaping results. Investors should also keep an eye on the overall tech sector's health, particularly in relation to AI and cloud computing, where Microsoft has established a strong foothold. Microsoft is expected to continue its strong financial performance. The consensus EPS forecast for the next quarter is 13.15, with estimates ranging between 12.74 and 13.86. On the revenue side, analysts expect $279.21 billion, reflecting Microsoft’s robust revenue growth of 15.7% year over year. These high expectations from analysts show optimism but also set the bar high for the upcoming report. The broader market conditions play a crucial role in Microsoft’s stock performance, especially with the tech sector facing some headwinds recently. Investors should consider the macroeconomic factors impacting tech stocks, including interest rates and inflation, which could introduce volatility around the earnings report. Microsoft’s focus on AI, cloud computing and its growth in enterprise software positions it well for future growth. Recent news includes its strategic partnerships and investments in AI, which could boost future revenue. Microsoft's 0.8% dividend yield and consistent payout add value for long-term investors. Microsoft’s focus on AI also aligns it with other top AI stocks that are poised for growth. Just as Nvidia stock has benefitted from advancements in AI, Microsoft is also expected to capitalize on similar trends. As the scheduled earnings date of October 30 approaches, several key metrics will be vital in evaluating Microsoft's performance. These include trends in semiconductor shortages that could affect production, memory chip pricing and any supply chain disruptions that may have occurred. Given the increasing reliance on technology across sectors, understanding these elements will provide deeper insights into Microsoft's revenue and profitability. Revenue growth remains a key metric for Microsoft. In the previous quarter, Microsoft’s revenue grew by 3.6%, with actual revenue coming in at $56.5 billion, beating estimates by nearly $2 billion. For the upcoming earnings, investors will focus on whether Microsoft can sustain or exceed its growth trajectory, particularly given its expansion into AI and cloud computing. With an operating margin of 44.6% and a gross margin of 69.8%, Microsoft’s profitability is another critical aspect of the earnings report. Investors will watch for any changes in operating income, especially given its strong Ebitda growth of 26.7% year over year, as it reflects the company’s operational efficiency.

The company has managed to grow its earnings per share by 21.9% year over year, which ties directly to its expanding customer base. A continuation of this trend would be a positive signal for long-term growth. Guidance is an essential part of the earnings report, offering insights into the company’s outlook. Microsoft typically provides projections that help investors assess the company’s growth trajectory. Analyzing this guidance helps investors understand the management's expectations and can significantly influence MSFT stock movement. If guidance exceeds market expectations, it could indicate robust future performance, whereas conservative projections may raise concerns. Deciding when to invest in Microsoft stock surrounding earnings reports is a critical consideration for investors. Buying before earnings can lead to significant gains if the report exceeds expectations. However, this strategy also comes with risks, including increased volatility. Conversely, purchasing after earnings allows for a more informed decision based on actual performance, yet it may result in missing out on potential price jumps. Buying before earnings can offer opportunities for early positioning and potential gains if the results are positive. However, this approach carries the risk of heightened volatility, as stocks can react sharply to earnings surprises. Additionally, investors may find themselves acting on limited information, which can lead to poor decision-making if expectations are not met. Pros Cons Purchasing after earnings presents its advantages, as it allows investors to make decisions based on actual performance rather than speculation. This can reduce the risk of significant losses if the stock reacts poorly to the earnings report. However, waiting until after the earnings release could mean missing out on a rally if the stock jumps in response to strong results. Furthermore, the market may overreact, leading to corrections or rebounds that savvy investors might miss. Pros Cons Investor sentiment plays a major role in stock price movement around earnings reports. Microsoft’s history of beating earnings estimates often fuels bullish sentiment, but the broader market sentiment, particularly in the tech sector, can introduce volatility. A positive outlook from the market can bolster MSFT stock prices, while negative sentiment may result in a downturn. Analysts often emphasize the need to understand how investor psychology interacts with earnings results, as this can lead to exaggerated reactions, impacting the stock's short-term performance. Understanding the pulse of market reactions before and after the report is crucial for timing your investment. Experts consistently view Microsoft as a solid investment, particularly with its expansion into AI and cloud computing. As the earnings report approaches, expert opinions become invaluable. Analysts provide context and insights that can shape investor expectations. By examining expert assessments, investors can gain a clearer picture of how Microsoft's performance aligns with broader market trends. This analysis can guide decisions on whether to hold, buy, or sell shares. Microsoft has a strong track record of earnings beats, but the decision to buy before or after earnings hinges on your risk tolerance. With robust growth in key areas and a bullish analyst outlook, investors need to carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach. Revenue growth, operating margins and customer growth in cloud and AI businesses. Microsoft’s next earnings report is expected on October 30, 2024, post-market hours.

Title: 2025 NFL mock draft: Ashton Jeanty surges up board, Travis Hunter remains No. 1

As the leaves start to fall in mid-October, so do the hopes of some NFL fan bases. And with college football officially reaching the midway point of its regular season, the time has come to revisit our early 2025 first round mock draft. As the only teams without a loss this season, the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and upstart Minnesota Vikings are two of the biggest stories of the early NFL season. A hot start does not guarantee the Lombardi Trophy, of course, so for the purposes of this mock draft, we simply took the reverse order of the current Super Bowl odds via DraftKings to create the selection order. [Related: Why Travis Hunter is an unprecedented prospect] Individual players' stocks will fluctuate in the months leading up to the draft, but at this point, cornerback, running back and linemen appear to be this year's strongest positional groups. That could make things interesting for teams like the Carolina Panthers, Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders, all of whom might be considering another reboot at quarterback in a draft currently featuring more questions than answers at the position. 1. Carolina Panthers: Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado The Panthers are the worst team in the NFL in just about every meaningful statistic, so new GM Dan Morgan and head coach Dave Canales have lots of work in front of them. Carolina has won a total of three games over the past two seasons and currently ranks dead last in points allowed (33.8 per game) and 28th in points scored (17.2). As such, the Panthers should exhaust all opportunities to trade out for more picks in a massive rebuild — which is precisely what I projected in last month's mock draft — but if forced to pick here, taking Hunter, the best player in the class, makes the most sense. 2. New England Patriots: Mason Graham, DT, Michigan No one needs to tell Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo about the impact quality defenders can have on a franchise. The 6-foot-3, 318-pound Graham was a rare true freshman starter at Michigan and bulldozed his way into First Team All-Big Ten honors a year ago with 36 tackles, including 7.5 for loss and three sacks. Paired with blossoming star Keion White, the Patriots could have the makings of a dominant defensive line. 3. Cleveland Browns: JT Tuimoloau, Edge, Ohio State Clearly, the Browns were expecting more with the acquisition of Deshaun Watson, but the club is essentially trapped by his massive contract, making a switch at the position unlikely. A boost to the offensive line would also be nice, but I don't see a blocker worthy of this pick. Instead, the Browns may shift their attention to the Buckeyes. With "just" 14 sacks over his first three years at the college level, Tuimoloau has not produced the eye-popping production some expected, but don't let the stats fool you. The power-packed 6-foot-5, 279-pounder turned down a chance at a first-round selection to return to Ohio State for a possible title run. I anticipate he will play his way into a top-10 selection next spring. 4. Las Vegas Raiders: Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado Sanders boasts many of the traits to project as a franchise NFL quarterback, but some will be turned off by his flashy personality. The Raiders have never shied from charisma and might see Sanders as the perfect jolt to the roster. His anticipation and accuracy — especially in the intermediate zones — would complement the investments Vegas has already made in early round tight ends Brock Bowers and Michael Mayer. 5. Tennessee Titans: Will Johnson, CB, Michigan While the Titans have other, bigger concerns on the roster, Johnson is arguably the top overall player in this class and is not likely to fall out of the top five. He offers a future Pro Bowl combination of size, speed, physicality and ball skills. The 6-foot-2, 202-pounder projects as an immediate difference-maker, similar to the Broncos' Patrick Surtain Jr. 6. Jacksonville Jaguars: Benjamin Morrison, CB, Notre Dame Three cornerbacks selected in the top six would be historic, but given the talent of this year's class, it's possible. The Jaguars certainly could use the help for a secondary that currently ranks last in the NFL in passing yards allowed (1,660) and touchdowns allowed (14) through the first six games of the season. A true ballhawk with nine interceptions recorded over his first two seasons, the 6-foot, 186-pound Morrison is well known for his soft hands and instincts in coverage, but scouts also like his reliability as an open-field tackler.

Los Angeles Rams: Will Campbell, OT, LSU With an aging quarterback, protection is key. An immediate standout who earned Second Team All-SEC honors as a true freshman, Campbell ascended to First Team honors in 2023, showing off the size, agility and strength to warrant a top-10 selection for a club that needs help on the offensive line. 8. New York Giants: Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State The selection of any running back this high will be panned by some, but special players deserve exceptions. The Giants are clearly missing the breakaway element that former top-10 pick Saquon Barkley provided and could see Jeanty as the quickest way to add spark to a middling offense. Jeanty's burst to and through the hole is exceptional, and he's a true three-down back, possessing both soft hands and physicality in pass protection. 9. Arizona Cardinals: Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State Ever since James Franklin took over at Penn State, the Nittany Lions have churned out edge rushers, and all indications are that Carter has "got next." Even while splitting duties with 2023 top-100 draft picks Chop Robinson and Adisa Isaac, the 6-foot-3, 250-pound Carter earned First Team All-Big Ten honors with 5.5 tackles for loss, including 4.5 sacks. 10. Denver Broncos: Nic Scourton, Edge, Texas A&M The Broncos already boast an ascending edge rusher in Jonathon Cooper and a versatile defensive lineman Zach Allen, but the former is in a contract year and will be expecting a big pay day. At 6-foot-4 and 280 pounds, Scourton combines prototypical size with good snap anticipation and power, projecting nicely as a two-gapping defensive end who would give Sean Payton & Co. some needed flexibility up front.

Miami Dolphins: Malaki Starks, S, Georgia The hope, of course, is that quarterback Tua Tagovailoa recovers from his latest concussion and remains healthy throughout the rest of 2024, justifying the massive $212 million dollar contract he signed in the offseason. If not, one of the top remaining quarterbacks (like Georgia's Carson Beck or Texas' Quinn Ewers) might be a strong consideration, as their anticipation and accuracy could make either a fine fit in Mike McDaniel's scheme. Let's remain optimistic that Tagovailoa returns, allowing Miami to focus elsewhere. Starks is a versatile safety with immediate impact potential, especially if plugged into a secondary already loaded with playmakers. 12. New Orleans Saints: Luther Burden III, WR, Missouri The Saints started the season on fire, scoring a combined 91 points in two victories, but they've stumbled since, losing four straight while scoring only 76 total points. Frankly, I think the Saints could use some grit at receiver. Powerfully-built at 5-foot-11 and 208 pounds, Burden could be the physical complement to the speedy (but injury-prone) Chris Olave.

Indianapolis Colts: Tyleik Williams, DT, Ohio State The Colts currently rank 31st in the NFL in rushing yards allowed (931 through six games) and could also use more pass rush from the interior. Williams isn't the biggest defensive tackle (6-foot-3, 327 pounds), but he's cat-quick and surprisingly powerful. He would add some youthful vigor to a front that is currently missing veteran DeForest Buckner, who has been on IR with a high ankle sprain. 14. Seattle Seahawks: Emery Jones Jr., OT, LSU Quite literally, a "big" reason why the Seahawks have lost their past three games has been ineffective play at right tackle. Seattle has young talent developing, but might jump at the chance to land a big bruiser like Jones, a three-year starter with plus size (6-foot-5, 320 pounds) and athleticism.

Los Angeles Chargers: Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan Few coaches prioritize tight ends like Jim Harbaugh, and he might jump at the opportunity to reunite with Loveland, one of the better all-around pass-catchers in this class. With just six touchdown receptions to his credit, Loveland likely won't generate first-round buzz from the analytics crowd, but the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder possesses the soft hands and balance through contact to be a monster in the middle in the NFL. 16. Pittsburgh Steelers: Jalen Milroe, QB, Alabama With his dual-threat abilities, Justin Fields has helped the Steelers start the season 4-2, but with Mike Tomlin considering a switch to Russell Wilson, clearly he doesn't see the former as an obvious long-term solution at quarterback — at least not yet. Regardless of which veteran ultimately pilots Pittsburgh for the rest of this season, the Steelers might pounce should a dynamic talent like Milroe fall into their lap. Milroe has made strides this season and boasts the upside to perhaps contend for QB1 honors in 2025. 17. Chicago Bears: James Pearce Jr., Edge, Tennessee Don't look now, but Caleb Williams and the Bears are starting to click on offense and have rattled off three consecutive wins. To capitalize on a suddenly explosive offense, the Bears may want to add to an already formidable pass rush with an explosive edge rusher like Pearce, who registered 10 sacks a season ago and, like the Bears, seems to be warming up after a slow start to the 2024 campaign. 18. Dallas Cowboys: Isaiah Bond, WR, Texas While veteran Brandin Cooks has proven to be a quality complementary threat to CeeDee Lamb when healthy, his inability to remain on the field has slowed the Cowboys' offense. Bond possesses similar straight-line speed as Cooks and would be a popular fit with an increasingly frustrated fan base.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona With five touchdowns over the first six games of the 2024 season, Mike Evans remains one of the NFL's best red-zone weapons. However, the Bucs could be looking for a younger and cheaper version, especially as the 10-year veteran's cap hit balloons from $5.56 to $22.38 million next season. Boasting similar size and hand strength to reel in jump-balls, McMillan would make a lot of sense. 20. Cincinnati Bengals: Deone Walker, DT, Kentucky While most are understandably focusing on the Bengals' struggling offense, one of the reasons why Cincinnati has started the season a disappointing 2-4 is a leaky run defense that has surrendered a combined 874 yards on the ground and seven touchdowns. Football is a big man's game, and they don't come much bigger than the 6-foot-6, 346-pound Walker, who earned Second Team All-SEC honors from league coaches a year ago after leading the Wildcats in tackles for loss (12.5) and sacks (7.5), despite fighting almost constant double-teams. 21. New York Jets: Carson Beck, QB, Georgia Aaron Rodgers will turn 41 in December, and with Tyrod Taylor (35) the only other quarterback on the roster, it seems obvious New York will be drafting a QB next spring. While ideally that might come later in the draft, I don't think GM Joe Douglas will wait if an ideal fit falls into their lap here. Beck possesses the size, arm and pro-style experience to project as a franchise quarterback, though he's raised more questions than answers with his inconsistent play so far this season.

Washington Commanders: Kelvin Banks, OT, Texas Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels has breathed life into a once-proud franchise, but if he is to enjoy long-term success, Washington needs to get some more ‘Hogs up front. Banks lacks ideal size, but his quickness and balance have made him a star at left tackle at Texas, and some believe his best fit in the NFL is at left guard. Regardless, the pro-ready Banks could be money in the bank for a franchise needing help up front. 23. Atlanta Falcons: Walter Nolen, DT, Mississippi Nolen captured the imagination of scouts with a breakout sophomore season at Texas A&M, and he has emerged as one of the nation's better, more disruptive DTs this season with the Rebels. He's on pace to shatter his previous career-highs in tackles (37), tackles for loss (nine) and sacks (four) and is even more disruptive than his numbers suggest. Given that the Falcons have an NFL-worst five sacks over their first six games, GM Terry Fontenot and defensive-minded head coach Raheem Mostert will almost certainly be looking to boost their front in the offseason.

Green Bay Packers: Cameron Williams, OT, Texas Similar to the Commanders two picks ahead of them, the Packers have emerged as one of the more exciting teams in all the NFL, in large part due to the stellar play from their quarterbacks, primarily starter Jordan Love. Now the challenge is protecting him. Williams is one of this year's quickest ascending prospects, starring at right tackle for a pass-heavy and pro-style Longhorns program that should ease his transition to the NFL. 25. Philadelphia Eagles: Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia The pipeline from Athens to Philadelphia could continue should the twitchy Walker still be on the board at this point, especially with the Eagles potentially looking for replacements for pending free agent edge rushers Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham. General manager Howie Roseman selected five former Georgia Bulldogs over the 2022-23 NFL drafts and might see Walker's burst and bend as the perfect way to bolster the pass rush while maintaining a tight salary cap. 26. Buffalo Bills: Denzel Burke, CB, Ohio State The first cornerback didn't come off the board until No. 22 overall this year, but Burke is part of a very intriguing class that, at least at this point, looks like one of the strongest of any position for 2025. Silky smooth in coverage, Burke just needs to show more ballhawking skills to earn a first round pick, as he had turned just two of his 26 career pass breakups into interceptions heading into this season. He intercepted a pass in the Buckeyes' season-opening win against Akron, showing the blend of traits and untapped potential Sean McDermott has always prioritized.

Houston Texans: Derrick Harmon, DL, Oregon As the Texans continue to light up scoreboards with their explosive offense, it will be critical for the club to add playmakers on defense. Harmon is one of the fastest-rising prospects in the country, emerging this year for the Ducks after transferring from Michigan State. At 6-foot-5 and 330 pounds, he possesses both NFL-caliber girth and power to collapse the pocket, something that defensive-minded head coach DeMeco Ryans will appreciate. 28. Minnesota Vikings: Mansoor Delane, CB, Virginia Tech While certainly not (yet) as celebrated as some of the other cornerbacks of this class, Delane is quietly earning first-round grades from scouts. Like the surprising 5-0 Vikings, he is flying a bit under the radar, but has turned heads already this season. He also is a three-year starter with impressive size (6-foot-1, 187). The Vikings' cornerback room is older than most, with 35-year-old Stephon Gilmore starting in his 13th NFL season. 29. Detroit Lions: Kenneth Grant, DT, Michigan With three defensive tackles set to hit free agency after this season, the Lions will be looking for size and strength on the interior this fall. They may not have to look far as the defending national champs boast two of the more dominant prospects at the position in Grant and the previously listed Mason Graham (No. 2 overall to New England). The 6-foot-3, 340-pound Grant was the headliner on Bruce Feldman's annual "Freaks" list, boasting a rare speed and power combination that should earn him a first round selection and perhaps help the Lions regain their roar, while another former Michigan star, Aidan Hutchinson, recovers from his horrific season-ending leg injury.

Baltimore Ravens: Aireontay Ersery, OT, Minnesota The Ravens have three offensive tackles playing in the final year of their respective contracts this season, including standout left tackle Ronnie Stanley. A phenomenal athlete at 6-foot-6 and 330 pounds, Ersery possesses the size and agility to warrant first round consideration, and he might love being reunited with his former Minnesota teammate Daniel Faalele, now the Ravens' starting right guard. 31. San Francisco 49ers: Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky Even with injuries limiting some of their best players early this season, the 49ers remain the NFC favorite to reach the Super Bowl. One veteran playing well — and likely expecting a big contract soon — is cornerback Charvarius Ward. Cash-strapped, San Francisco may have little choice but to look to the draft for a cheaper replacement for Ward. Hairston plays with a similar brand of physicality. 32. Kansas City Chiefs: Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State Given the quick ascent of rookie wideout Xavier Worthy, wide receiver is not a massive need for the Chiefs. However, general manager Brett Veach has won big by simply playing the Best-Player-Available strategy so far and the polished Egbuka certainly would qualify as that, providing Patrick Mahomes with yet another talented pass-catcher and the franchise some insurance should injuries and other off-field concerns limit Rashee Rice in the future.

Title: Vice Bosses Talk Next Steps Following Bankruptcy And Tease New Production Finance Facility That Will Make It A “One-Stop Studio Shop”
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/10/vice-business-model-production-finance-facility-1236117304/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T18:27:52Z
Full Content:
By Diana Lodderhose International Features Editor EXCLUSIVE: This year has seen a swath of global production and distribution entities in film and television impacted by layoffs and cuts, and Vice Media Group has been no exception. Following the company’s much-publicized bankruptcy in 2022, when it was sold for $350 million to hedge fund and former investor Fortress, the group underwent a raft of layoffs and restructuring earlier this year, with its production business, Vice Studios Group, now being led by Jamie Hall in London and Danny Gabai in Los Angeles. But Hollywood loves a comeback, and Vice Media CEO Bruce Dixon tells Deadline in a rare interview that Vice is back from the brink in a smaller capacity but with a clear vision and money to spend — the latter in the form of an imminent production finance facility, which it hopes to launch before the year end. Watch on Deadline “There’s no doubt that the business is far healthier than it was a year ago,” says Dixon. “One of the things I want to focus on is obviously culture and morale – it’s a tough industry to be in at the moment but we’re feeling positive because we have become a far more agile company.” The Vice chief says he expects the company to be in profit in Q1 2025. “We’re smaller, we take opportunities where we can now and, more importantly, we’re backed by our investors and our board in terms of looking for opportunities for growth and exciting projects.” Today, the company is operating at 30% of its size compared to the beginning of the year. Dixon says this leaner operation – and particularly its global production entity Vice Studios Group, which is behind projects such as Gangs of London, the Saoirse Ronan feature film Bad Apples, Netflix doc Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now and upcoming hybrid musical/doc Pavements – means it can better adapt to the changing market. Key to this, Dixon says, will be the introduction of a production finance facility, which it is currently at the “advanced stages” of securing. The London-based exec says he was recently in LA working on securing the production facility which will, he says, help propel the company’s strategy to move its studio business into a “more IP-based” content business and will enable it to be a “one-stop studio shop.” “We were forced to be a camera for hire for so long and that had more to do with our corporate resources than anything else,” says Dixon. “So, being able to break through what we went through in a much-publicized bankruptcy, we’re now focusing on the positives of being in the content business.” He continues: “We’re recognizing that we’ve always had that skillset, but we’ve just never had the financial capability to go out and be the super studio – which we have all the skills for, but we’ve never been able to put something up front on projects and get involved at earlier stages. That’s somewhat hindered us. It hasn’t hindered our creativity, but it’s hindered our output and our ability to improve margins and be a more successful financial business.” Vice Studios Group co-president Gabai notes that with streaming services and many premium cablers “moving away from a world where they do all-rights buyouts,” the introduction of a facility will better enable Vice to compete on a global scale for content via co-financing agreements or co-productions. “We do so much global production in the UK and other territories that, for us, it feels like there are more opportunities for windowing,” he says. “There’s an opportunity for a studio player out there who can really step into that role and fill the gap on productions that may be launching out of the UK, or other territories, and we can give them that extra piece of resource that they would need to go into production.” While Dixon couldn’t reveal any more details about numbers or timing on the finance facility, he did indicate that he was hopeful it will launch “before the end of the year.” “It’s something that is a priority for us and we hope to close it soon,” he says. “But it will allow us to have more possibilities as a company and allows us to be a little more opportunistic in our ideas, while also bringing more certainty around the projects we are doing.” Vice Media Group, which moved out of the online news game earlier this year, has trimmed down to focus on its Virtue ad agency and Vice TV, a joint venture with A&E, in addition to its studio business. Meanwhile, Vice Digital, a culture hub publishing content on and around Vice’s platforms, which Dixon notes was a “massive financial burden for us,” has since relaunched under a new joint venture with Nashville-based Savage Ventures. In the company’s tumultuous 18 months, one bright spot has been its global production business Vice Studios Group, which has a distribution catalogue of more than 1,000 hours and oversees five premium production entities: Pulse Films, UnTypical, Vice Studios LatAm, Vice Studios Canada and a news documentary unit. By the end of 2024, the group expects to have produced 21 projects including Pulse Films-produced Pavements, from director Alex Ross Perry, and Sky Original and Pulse Films series Atomic, starring Alfie Allen and Shazad Latif, the latter of which wrapped in Morocco last summer. The company is currently shooting the third season of British crime drama Gangs of London (seasons 1 & 2 launched on Netflix in September as part of a wide-ranging deal with AMC Networks) and also premiered Jason Pollard-directed doc Ol’Dirty Bastard: A Tale of Two Dirtys at the UK’s Doc’n Roll Film Festival. Vice Studios and Viral Nation recently announced the development of unscripted series Montana Boyz (working title), about TikTok cowboys Kaleb Winterbrun, Mark Estes and Kade Wilcox. “This will be the largest production year we’ve ever had, which is crazy when we are coming out of a bankruptcy,” says Gabai. “We’ve had this happen with all of the headwinds going on around us and a really tough marketplace, but now those headwinds are behind us.” Gabai notes that he and fellow Co-President Hall had previously restructured the studio business when Vice Studios and Pulse merged a few years prior to the bankruptcy. “I think, to some extent, the studio has been operating with the benefit of a very tightly knit group of people for a couple of years,” he says. The manifesto for the studios business is to focus on director-driven talent: “We tend to work with really great filmmakers and, oftentimes, if they’re not already huge household names when we start working with them, they tend to grow into big names off the back of doing projects with us.” This year, Vice reunited with its Fyre documentary director Chris Smith for Devo, a doc about the band of the same name which launched in Sundance earlier this year. It is also producing Hollywood Ending, from Tiger King director Rebecca Chaiklin, via its UnTypical strand, which follows the downfall of Zach Horwitz, the charismatic “midwestern, millennial Madoff” who ran a $690M Ponzi scheme under the noses of those closest to him. The latter was picked up by Amazon MGM. “I used to say in my agent days that talented people are always talented,” says Gabai. “Whether somebody’s having a hot moment or a cold moment or they’re making a million things at once, or they haven’t worked for a couple of years – if someone is really talented and attacks their projects in an interesting way, that’s somebody we want to bet on.” It was this vision that ultimately led Vice Studios to bringing aboard Listen Up Philip director Ross Perry to helm Pavements, a documentary/fiction hybrid about the venerable U.S. indie rock band Pavement fronted by Stephen Malkmus. Pavement is best known for songs such as “Cut Your Hair” and “Stereo,” which they released through Matador Records. The Pulse Films-produced project, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival last month and is having its UK premiere at the London Film Festival today, intimately shows the band preparing for their sold-out 2022 reunion tour, while simultaneously taking the audience behind the scenes of the making of a musical, a museum and a spoof Hollywood biopic, featuring Jason Schwarzman as Matador Records founder Chris Lombardi and Joe Keery as Malkmus. Matador Records and Pavement were keen to do something “totally different” says Gabai, and he says that “this felt like a good opportunity to take the piss out of a standard music documentary.” “Alex was the top director on my list and Stephen seems like the character that Alex would have written about and created,” says Gabai. For Ross Perry, he was drawn to the “big, structural conceit of the film: “I just thought this movie should take place in a world where Pavement are as worthy of every form of tribute as say, the Rolling Stones, The Beatles or David Bowie because, for a few 100,000 people, that’s true,” he says. “In the spirit of the band, we wanted to put this whole endeavor in quotation marks, in the way they put the idea of being a successful band in quotations.” Pavements, says Gabai, is a prime example of the kinds of projects Vice Studios will aim to back going forward. “It’s always filmmaker first for us. Everything we do is driven by the filmmaker or the showrunner or the core creative on any project, what they want to do with the material on that project and what they want to say about this crazy world that we live in while doing it in a way that is fun and entertaining.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: Nvidia nears a new record as AI demand drives a big TSMC earnings beat

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%) briefly reached a new intraday high on Thursday after its Taiwanese chipmaking partner beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock was up around 2.8% during mid-day trading on Thursday, at about $139.51 per share. Earlier in the day, the stock briefly climbed over 3% to set a new intraday record of $140.89 per share, according to CNBC. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+0.52%) shares were up around 12% during mid-day trading on Thursday after it beat earnings expectations for the third quarter. The Taiwanese chipmaker reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ended September 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.51%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+0.64%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD+1.27%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Leading today’s Green Deals is an exclusive discount on Anker’s latest SOLIX C300 DC 90,000mAh/288Wh Portable Power Station that drops costs to a new $148 low price while also giving you some free gear. Next, we spotted Samsung’s AI-supported Bespoke All-in-One Electric Washer & Ventless Heat Pump Dryer starting from its $1,800 Best Buy low, with some additional chances to save. We have two great Greenworks deals – one on the 40V 20-inch Cordless Electric Push Mower that just hit a new $304 Amazon low, with a more advanced combo bundle that gets you a mower, blower, and string trimmer. Bringing up the rear is a one-day-only discount on GoTrax’s Z4 LITE Folding e-bike that has dropped it back to a $600 low. Plus, all the other hangover Green Deals in the links at the bottom of the page, like yesterday’s coverage of the latest sales on Velotric’s e-bikes and NIU’s KQi e-scooters, and more. Head below for other New Green Deals we’ve found today and, of course, Electrek’s best EV buying and leasing deals. Also, check out the new Electrek Tesla Shop for the best deals on Tesla accessories. We’ve got an exclusive chance for 9to5Toys readers to save more money than before on Anker’s newest SOLIX C300 DC 90,000mAh Portable Power Station while getting some free gear all for $148 shipped, after using the promo code 9TO5PBANK26. Down from a $200 price tag, we’ve already seen a few discounts for this unit since it first hit the market in August, with the biggest of them being its $150 launch price which we just saw repeat for the first time at the tail-end of last month. It’s getting beaten out here today though, as this promotion gives you a slightly bigger 26% markdown that saves you $52 and sets a new all-time low price. Not only does it beat out Anker and Amazon’s current markdowns to $180, but it also comes with a free USB-C charging cable as well as a carrying strap which hasn’t been offered with the station since its early-bird launch special. Anker’s SOLIX C300 DC power station arrives in a compact 90,000mAh/288Wh unit that easily stores away inside your bag, delivering up to 300W of power output for your more personal devices. This model boasts the first of Anker’s inclusions of boosted recharging speeds that you can take advantage of by using its two bidirectional 140W USB-C ports at the same time for up to 280W speeds. There’s also the bonus option of recharging its battery via a 100W solar panel that refills it in 3.2 hours. You’ll have a solid variety of output connection options with its four USB-C ports (a 15W port, a 100W port, and the two 140W ports), two 12W USB-A ports, and a 120W auxiliary port. Taking a note from its predecessor, the 60,000mAh PowerCore Reserve, Anker has continued the trend of including an integrated pop-up LED light in the C300 DC power station that provides three different brightness levels that can be used as a camping lantern or emergency light source. While you can monitor and adjust settings through the companion app via a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, it also provides readouts on its display too. Best Buy is having a Samsung savings event through October 20 that is cutting costs on a lineup of Samsung devices and appliances to update and upgrade your home life, with the brand’s Bespoke AI 5.3 Cubic-Foot All-in-One Electric Washer & Ventless Heat Pump Dryer down at $1,799.99 shipped. Normally going for $2,800 at Best Buy, with a greater $3,324 price tag direct from Samsung, we saw it fall to its lowest rate back in June when Costco offered a short-lived markdown to $1,600, while Best Buy last saw its $1,800 low during Labor Day sales. It’s returning here today though, offering up $1,000 in savings while also offering $50 rewards for My Best Buy Plus and Total members. Bargain hunters can also save an additional $278 when buying this model in excellent open-box condition. One thing to note before we dive into its capabilities is that Samsung has this washer & dryer currently marked down to $1,999 shipped, with its open-box option being slightly higher than Best Buy’s at $1,599 (click the “add” box to the side), which does balance out the differences in cost with a few added benefits with either purchase. First, you’ll get two years of Samsung Care+ for just $1 over its usual $149 price on top of getting free installation too. This ENERGY STAR-certified all-in-one washer & dryer arrives AI-supported for less time consuming and easier managed laundry routines that you don’t have to babysit. The AI programming in this model lets the unit detect different fabric types and adjust its own settings in response to their soil levels. Its detergent tank has been given a larger capacity than we often see in these appliances, holding up to 47 loads worth of detergent before needing a refill – plus, its Flex One compartment takes the convenience to the next level as it can be split between 25 loads of detergent and 34 loads of softener. As is the case with models in the green category, we cannot gloss over the biggest design feature here: its ventless heat pump design. Not only does it allow you to rethink its placement in your home (as it doesn’t need to go where the one vent is located like standard models and plugs into a standard wall outlet), but its dual-inverter heat pump tech also significantly increases energy efficiency while working in conjunction with the AI system to calculate and predict your electricity costs to “reduce energy usage by up to 19%.” It’s also been given self-cleaning and self-drying tech to keep laundry coming out fresh, smart controls via the SmartThings app (as well as hands-free voice controls too), the EPA’s seal of approval, and much more. Head below to learn about the rest of what this appliance can bring to your home. Be sure to check out the entire lineup of Samsung appliances and devices that are benefitting from Best Buy’s sale, like tablets, TVs, PCs, laptops, monitors, and more that we covered when it first launched. You can also check out the direct offers from Samsung here. The colder months may be setting in on us, but lawns still need to be kept up and deals can often be better in these fall and winter months. Amazon is following this line of thinking as it offers the Greenworks 40V 20-inch Cordless Electric Push Mower for $303.98 shipped. Usually goes for $400, which isn’t too bad of a starting price for an electric mower (compared to some of the bigger high-end models). We’ve seen a few discounts over 2024 that bring costs down even lower, most repeating the same drop to the former $320 Amazon low, but today those rates are beaten out by this even greater 24% markdown that takes $96 off the price tag and lands it at a new Amazon low. Powered by the included 4.0Ah battery, this Greenworks mower’s 40V brushless motor delivers a nice uniform cut for yards up to 1/3 acre in size after one round of charging. Everything is housed within a 20-inch steel deck crowned by LED headlights for those early morning and late evening jobs, while the folding handles “saves 70% more space in seconds with vertical storage.” There are seven different cutting height levels to choose from here, as well as a 4-in-1 design that does the usual mulching, side discharging, or rear-bagging for your grass clippings on top of a turbo leaf pickup setting for a bit more versatile use. Of course, you’ll never have to struggle with a pull string here either, as it has been given a convenient push-button start to compliment its electric functionality. For folks looking to expand their lawn care arsenal beyond just a mower, Amazon is also currently offering a Greenworks bundle of an 80V 21-inch Self-Propelled Cordless Electric Lawn Mower, an Axial Leaf Blower, and a 16-inch String Trimmer at its lowest price of $630, down from $900. You’re getting a more advanced mower here that offers most of the same features as the above model, trading its turbo leaf pickup for an improved self-propulsion system alongside a greater runtime that can tackle yards up to 1/2 an acre. There’s also the Axial leaf blower that hits 580 CFM for yard-clearing power with a turbo mode and even cruise control locks, as well as the attachment-capable string trimmer with a bump feed head, variable speed control, and a load n’ go spool for faster and easier re-spooling. Courtesy of its Deals of the Day, Best Buy is offering the GoTrax Z4 LITE Folding e-bike for $599.99 shipped for the rest of the day. Normally priced at $900, we’ve seen it listed at higher rates between $900 and $1,100 from other third-party retailers. We’ve seen a few of these one-day discounts drop costs on this entry-level model, first to $650 at the start of summer, and then some repeated falls to $600 in July and August. After a lull on price cuts until now, this is a chance to save yourself $300 while also grabbing this commuting solution at the lowest price we have tracked. The GoTrax Z4 LITE e-bike makes a great first-time choice for riders looking to enter the e-bike world without dropping serious cash right away, delivering 20 MPH top speeds and an impressive traveling distance of up to 40 miles on a single charge (25 miles when you only use the throttle). The triple-folding frame design houses the 350W motor and the removable 48V battery while providing easier storage and transport options when not in use. It also comes along with 20-inch fat tires, dual front and rear braking, an integrated headlight and taillight that provides brake light functionality, a rear cargo rack, a kickstand, and a digital display. The savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: Nvidia Stock Hits Another Record High as AI Chip Excitement Returns

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) set a fresh record intraday high Thursday as a blowout earnings report from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) eased concerns that the semiconductor market was stalling. TSMC posted a 54% year-over-year jump in profit and a 39% rise in revenue in the third quarter on artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales, and the company predicted demand would continue into the future. That offset news earlier this week from Dutch semiconductor maker ASML Holding (ASML), which warned that the recovery in non-AI chips was taking longer than anticipated. Adding to the positive feelings about Nvidia were comments from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller about his sale of the company's shares. The Duquesne Family Office CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that "it was a big mistake" to dump all his stake, adding, "I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there." Nvidia shares were recently up 2.7% to $139.39 after earlier Thursday touching a record $140.89. They have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2024. TradingView

Title: Tech Troubles: Digital Era Downsides (And How To Solve Them)
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/17/tech-troubles-digital-era-downsides-and-how-to-solve-them/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T17:15:32Z

Advances in technology have introduced revolutionary process and service upgrades for businesses in recent years. Digital tools have enabled remote work and global hiring, streamlined (and sometimes taken over) repetitive processes, improved customer service and outreach, and more. However, progress often comes with pain points, and the growing use of technology in business has raised some serious security, social, ethical and sustainability concerns. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council reflect on some of the downsides of the digital era they’ve observed, as well as why it’s essential to acknowledge and address these issues. The growing use of artificial intelligence is causing a drastic increase in data center power consumption, straining traditional infrastructure and contributing to environmental peril. However, data centers that adopt distributed energy solutions like microgrids can mitigate these issues with localized, sustainable and scalable power, ensuring they remain resilient and energy-efficient in the face of rising AI demands. - Ravi Prasher, Bloom Energy The increasing reliance on technology has notably shortened the attention span of today’s workforce. Establishing dedicated “focus time,” when we deliberately avoid using our devices, can help. Additionally, silencing phones, minimizing nonessential notifications and creating tech-free zones are effective strategies to combat distractions and boost productivity in an ever-connected world. - Batul Bohara, Amazon.com Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? In the race to leverage transformative technologies, it can be easy to lose sight of the critical role only humans can play in the outcomes they deliver. Embracing today’s powerful technologies requires managing the risks they bring, and organizations that rank empathy, critical thinking and creativity among the workforce skills they value will have an edge in meeting these challenges. - Merav Yuravlivker, Data Society Like many, I see the issues with all things related to security, but another big problem is the loss of focus on critical thinking and individual creativity. The rapid evolution of AI has created a vast number of use cases, but that shouldn’t result in the elimination of individual thought. Combining the power of AI technology with experiential human knowledge and creative thought creates more robust solutions more quickly. Foster an environment that embraces combining the power of creative thought with the power of technology. - Johanna Baum, S3 Consulting Business data doubles almost every three years due to advanced technology. The concern is where to go from here. Do we let the data explosion continue freely? There are technologies that can actively delete data and files based on document retention policies and regulations. Such services not only help us manage the volume of data being stored, but can also protect corporations from unnecessary risks in the future. - Kazuhiro Gomi, NTT Research One negative impact of technology’s growth in business is the rise of job displacement due to automation. To address this, companies can invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, empowering workers to adapt to new roles and technologies. This fosters career growth alongside tech advancements. - Tina Gada, Vanguard Group Despite investing billions in software and point solutions, organizations in complex industries (like construction and manufacturing) are plagued by disconnected systems and data. A “one size fits all” approach to technology doesn’t work; instead, look for simple, custom-fit solutions capable of solving problems in a single platform, unlocking the potential of every employee to make an impact. - Ed Jennings, Quickbase The breadth of software modern workers need to get their jobs done and the siloed nature of teams makes IT sprawl a very real problem, contributing to sunken costs and security risks. One way to mitigate this is to look for and choose solutions within your existing business platform. This approach can help organizations better manage identity security, ensuring people have only the access they need to get their work done. - John Milburn, Clear Skye One negative impact of growing tech use is the rise in electronic waste, as businesses frequently upgrade devices. To address this, companies can implement e-waste recycling programs and invest in longer-lasting, repairable technology. Promoting a circular economy reduces environmental harm while fostering a more sustainable tech life cycle. - Miguel Llorca, Torrent Group One negative impact of growing technology use in business is the rise of employee burnout due to constant connectivity and blurred work-life boundaries. To address this, companies can implement “digital wellness” policies, such as enforcing regular breaks, setting boundaries on after-hours communication and promoting time off to ensure employees can disconnect and recharge effectively. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The digital divide creates a stark gap between those with access to technology and those without, deepening socioeconomic inequalities. Rural areas and low-income communities often face limited access to high-speed internet, devices and digital literacy. To bridge this divide, we must invest in infrastructure, affordable access and education, ensuring equitable opportunities in a rapidly digitizing world. - Vamsi Krishna Dhakshinadhi, GrabAgile Inc. Messaging on Slack and meeting online is undeniably convenient, but I also think it’s overused. As a leader, when I can, I like to meet in person, pick up the phone or use a means of connecting that is even just one degree more “human.” We talk a lot about creating human-centered software, but we can also choose to do without the software and just be human. - Lindsey Witmer Collins, WLCM “Welcome” App Studio As businesses digitize, a key issue is data privacy. The vast amount of personal information collected increases the risk of breaches. To address this, companies should implement privacy-by-design frameworks, encrypt sensitive data and promote transparency in how data is used. This builds customer trust while ensuring compliance with evolving data protection regulations. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech One negative impact of growing technology use is the rise in algorithmic bias, where AI systems unintentionally perpetuate social biases in decision making, from hiring to credit approval. To mitigate this, businesses should implement continuous bias audits and develop explainable AI frameworks to ensure transparency and fairness, while involving diverse teams in the AI development process. - Andrii Kovalchuk, WeSoftYou Inc. A negative impact from the rise of generative AI is that people are accepting its outputs as truth, without question. It’s not always the case that GenAI’s responses are correct. Generative AI creates an answer instead of looking for one—it will sometimes create incorrect answers, and people should be aware of that. - Gonçalo Ribeiro, YData In my sector (public health), many experienced health workers are not tech-savvy. Adding technology tools can help community-based organizations sustainably grow, but for many community health workers, the transition is not easy. It’s difficult but essential to strike a balance between opportunity and sustainable social change. - Syam Adusumilli, GroundGame Health Data intolerance is growing in businesses. Have you ever tried to search an organization’s website for useful information? Good luck. The chronic lack of searchable data strangles productivity, stifles creativity and foments employee burnout. Answers aren’t as simple as “you know, AI” or “get search.” Unbreaking search requires careful, policy-based data planning, executive buy-in and deep technical talent. - James Stanger, CompTIA One downside of the growing use of technology in business is that people tend to become too dependent on it. This makes companies vulnerable when their systems fail or they’re hit with cyberattacks. To minimize risk, businesses should develop effective backup plans, diversify their tech tools to avoid reliance on a single system, and regularly train employees to handle unexpected issues. - Sergii Malomuzh, Rewump

Major U.S. indexes were higher at midday Thursday, as a strong report on demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all advanced. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) reported profit soared on demand for AI chips, sending its U.S.-listed shares to an all-time high. The news helped drive Nvidia shares to a record high as well. Blackstone (BX) shares also surged to a fresh high after the asset manager said its profit jumped as it brought in more investments. Elevance Health (ELV) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the insurer reported a weaker-than-expected profit and lowered its guidance as changes in Medicaid slashed membership rolls. Shares of CSX (CSX) dropped as the freight shipper’s results missed estimates and it cut its outlook as Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted operations. Lucid Group (LCID) shares sank as the struggling luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker announced a $1.67 billion stock sale and warned it would have a larger quarterly loss than expected. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and yen, but lost ground to the pound. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

The case that Ozempic (NVO-0.63%) and other GLP-1 medications could help people with substance use disorders is getting stronger. Blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1 treatments, could help people struggling with alcohol and opioid addiction, according to a new study published Thursday in the scientific journal Addiction. In a retrospective study, researchers found that patients with opioid use disorder who had a GLP-1 prescription had a 40% lower rate of opioid overdoses compared with those without a prescription. Additionally, people with alcohol use disorder with a GLP-1 prescription had 50% fewer instances of alcohol intoxication compared with those without a prescription. Researchers from the Loyola University Chicago made the findings by analyzing the medical records of over 500,000 patients with substance use disorders. GLP-1s are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. Demand for these medications has turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY-1.30%), the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound (both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss), into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Additionally, the mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” the study authors wrote. The study follows other anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggests GLP-1 drugs can help users curb addictions. A Morgan Stanley (MS-2.32%) survey from earlier this year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. The investment bank surveyed approximately 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1. The analysts noted they were “cautious about drawing conclusions” from their survey about the impact of GLP-1 drugs on addictive behaviors. While research hasn’t yet proven a causal link, clinical trials are currently underway to better understand the effects of GLP-1s on alcohol and tobacco consumption. One small trial found that people with alcohol use disorder drank less after taking semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic — compared with people who took a placebo.

Plus: AI Policy Records Of Trump And Harris, Apple And Nvidia See Their Values Increase, Companies To Improve AI Get Investments, AMD And Intel Join Forces On x86 Collaboration Even though neither of the candidates on major presidential tickets are talking much about AI, it’s a huge area of concern for tech leaders. Nearly three in four tech leaders said the election will have a major impact on whether the U.S. tech sector will be able to stay ahead of global competitors, according to a poll published this week by EY US. Specifically, they said, it will impact cybersecurity and data protection, AI and machine learning, and user data and content oversight. There are very few issues that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are even remotely close to agreeing on, so this result from the poll isn’t a surprise. But it’s worth taking a look at what may happen in terms of tech policy if either candidate is elected. As a part of President Joe Biden’s administration, Harris supported the executive order he signed last year to place guardrails on the use and development of AI. The executive order mandates guidelines and standards for government use of AI, requires government oversight of AI models that could pose a risk to national security, and essentially sets the stage to ensure privacy, equity and civil rights are protected through the use of AI technology. Harris spoke about the order days after it was signed at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London, saying it is possible to ensure ordinary people are protected from AI misuse—like explicit deepfake images of them being shared, or insurance claims being denied because of faulty AI algorithms—and not stifle broader innovation. When Biden signed the executive order last year, several tech CEOs were immediately on board and had been working with the federal government to develop AI regulations. Trump said last December he plans to cancel Biden’s executive order if elected, and that he’d also “ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on day one.” There hasn’t been much else published about what Trump would do instead, though a rundown by law firm Winston + Strawn indicates he has said that AI’s power to distort can be “scary,” and the threat AI could pose to security requires immediate attention. When Trump was president in 2019, he signed an executive order for the federal government to direct more funding to AI R&D and work toward building governance standards. Tech executive and self proclaimed “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk has been close to the Trump campaign, and Musk has used his social platform X to share his view that the First Amendment can protect campaign-related AI deepfakes and reproductions of copyrighted images. Trump has not endorsed Musk’s views, but he could be influenced by them. But no matter who wins the election, 87% of tech leaders told EY they plan to increase AI investments by 50% or more in the next year, with most saying they want to reallocate existing resources toward AI. So even if the election has a huge impact on larger policy, businesses will stay on the journey to implement the technology to make their work more efficient and useful. Even for a technology like AI, which many are committed to investing in, companies need to examine the ROI for systems they want to adopt. I talked to Anurag Malik, president and CTO of legal AI platform company ContractPodAi, about how to determine this and get the greatest value out of AI investments. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nominations for Forbes’ CIO Next List are now open. If you know any CIOs who are making an outsized impact on their company or business, please let us know about them here by November 8. Apple introduced its new iPad Mini this week. Apple’s stock surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, with the tech company briefly being worth $3.61 trillion. The likely catalyst was the announcement of a new iPad Mini model, which is the first update to that model since 2021. The new iPad Mini, which is available for pre-orders now and goes on sale next week, has a powerful A17 processor that will work with the company’s Apple Intelligence features when it launches later this month, writes Forbes senior contributor David Phelan. It also has 128GB of storage in its basic configuration, which is twice that of earlier models. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said lead times for the iPhone 16, released last month, are “encouraging,” and the 56 million iPhones shipped last month was 10% more than expected, writes Forbes’ Derek Saul. Apple’s share price moderated a bit on Wednesday, but it will be both rolling out Apple Intelligence and reporting earnings at the end of the month, so more big changes can be expected. Nvidia’s stock has also been rallying for much of October, and is nipping at Apple’s heels as the current second most valuable company by market cap. Nvidia’s stock surge, fueled by optimism and encouraging words about demand from CEO Jensen Huang, briefly moderated on Tuesday. Dutch firm ASML, which makes equipment used to manufacture high-end AI chips, mistakenly reported earnings a day early and warned of “more gradual growth” to come, with 2025 revenue projections well below analysts’ expectations. ASML’s share price fell 17.5% on Tuesday, bringing down stock for Nvidia and other AI chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, Arm Holdings and Broadcom. But the rally picked back up again Thursday morning, when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported blockbuster earnings and increased its revenue guidance. TSMC’s stock went up more than 12%, boosting its market cap above $1 trillion, and taking chip stocks including Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Intel with it. Decagon cofounders Jesse Zhang (left) and Ashwin Sreenivas. Two startups focused on improving AI platforms raised large Series B rounds this week. Decagon, a platform that builds AI customer service agents, raised $65 million in a round led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from tech investor Elad Gil and VC firms Accel and Bond Capital, writes Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava. Decagon, whose agents are used by companies including Notion, Duolingo, Rippling, Bilt and Substack, is now valued at $650 million, with $100 million in total funding to date. The company plans to use the funds to grow its team, go after new types of customers and add a voice feature. Galileo, a startup that evaluates AI models to ensure they aren’t hallucinating or giving out proprietary data when prompted, announced a $45 million funding round, writes Forbes’ Richard Nieva. The round was led by Scale Venture Partners, with participation by Premji Invest, venture arms of Citibank and the data storage company Databricks and Hugging Face founder Clem Delangue. The three-year-old company, which offers four products to help companies train and evaluate their AI systems, says it has raised a total of $68 million to date. getty As technology changes, competitors are becoming allies. Intel and AMD announced the creation of an x86 ecosystem advisory group this week, dedicated to bringing tech industry leaders together to come up with consistent and compatible implementations for a variety of applications and platforms using x86 architecture. Forbes senior contributor Patrick Moorhead talked to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and AMD CEO Lisa Su about the rival companies—they still will be competitors, Su and Gelsinger told Moorhead—coming together now to give x86 processors the same kind of alignment found in the Arm processor ecosystem. Su told Moorhead that customers have likely been wanting this kind of arrangement for decades to make it easier on their software stack, and working with Intel on the standards is “a major benefit for our customers and for the ecosystem.” The two CEOs said the industry cooperation will help speed innovation and build market opportunities for x86 processors going forward. Most of Big Tech is represented in the group, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Broadcom, Dell, HP, HPE, Lenovo, Oracle, Red Hat, Tim Sweeney of Epic Games and Linus Torvalds of the Linux Foundation. ContractPodAi President and CTO Anurag Malik. Whenever a company wants to add new tech, even the most bullish will question its ROI. I talked to Anurag Malik, president and CTO of legal AI platform company ContractPodAi, about how companies can get the most out of their investments in AI technology. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do most companies go about trying to figure out the ROI of generative AI? Malik: We are all running a business. Most companies buying a product are doing it for return on investment, with or without AI. I think the onus lies on the product provider to show that value. Value can come in many ways. It could be time saved, people being redirected to something more efficient, cutting down on outside spend. We think of AI as something that’s not going to take jobs away, but it’s going to make you much more efficient. You’ll be able to do much more of what you used to do before with limited resources, especially repeatable tasks, mundane tasks, which is very easy for AI to pick up. One thing we do is show productivity dashboards within the product, which shows time saved, number of tasks finished in whatever amount of time. We let our buyers input how much time it takes them today. Then we do a comparison: This is how long it’s taking you now, and you can put in a dollar value to the labor and then get ROI. One of the shortfalls is people tend to map existing processes to a technology, which is very different from how they were do[ing] things manually before. Helping them bridge that and re-imagining how they would use the technology to do things different[ly] and be much more productive is something the provider should do because the buyer is new to our technology and it’s on us to guide them. It’s more of a consultative way of selling AI and educating the customers as we go along. When a company is looking to adopt AI, or any sort of tech system that will definitely change the way they do things, should they be thinking ROI first, or should they be thinking about long-term capabilities? Being long-sided on this is way more valuable. In fact, when we onboard customers, we tell them, “Hey, we all walk and run.” As cliche as it sounds, you can’t go from zero to 100 miles an hour in two seconds. This is not a Tesla. This is a new system. There’s people involved who have to learn to use it. So let’s get the low-hanging fruits. You may not see it’s better than what you do today. You may not see humongous ROI, but if you get people on board and make them get used to the product, the road down is going to look much more productive for you. Absolutely, that long-term vision is very necessary. Software providers have to educate their customers to see that, to give them that vision. Because remember, everybody who comes to buy technology is trying to solve a pain point today. They’re not trying to see what’s going to happen in three years down the line. Yes, they’re invested in it, but if you educate them well enough that, hey, you're not only going to solve this pain point today, but if you take a step back, you can see the vision of how you can really transform how you’re doing things. What are some of the things that get in the way of companies realizing the ROI potential that they have with AI? Adoption. The distance to change is the biggest thing I’ve seen. Especially global companies: different regions, different teams. For it to go from one region to another is the biggest challenge. One thing I’ve seen is if you get the first one right and make a good story of it, educate teams wherever in the world they are, it works very well. The first success story is very important. It doesn’t matter how well your software works. If people are not going to use it, it’s as good as crap. Adoption and change management—making people understand [they need] to change the way they do things—is very important. Even more important than the actual technology itself. Amazon entered into agreements with Dominion Energy, Energy Northwest and startup X-energy to fund development and deployment of small modular reactors—small and advanced nuclear reactors—to create the power needed for AI datacenters. $500 million: Amount invested in X-energy for these reactors, anchoed by Amazon 960: Megawatts of power to be created by the four SMRs Amazon is helping Energy Northwest develop. This is enough to power the equivalent of 770,000 homes ‘Nuclear is a great option for how we scale the world’s energy needs’: Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told Forbes Executives are faced with an avalanche of tasks that can be difficult to prioritize. Here’s how to use the Eisenhower Matrix—a streamlined and simple way of thinking about things—to help decide where to invest your time and energy.

GE Aerospace (GE) will report earnings for the third quarter Tuesday morning, at a time when the aerospace industry faces some uncertainty with Boeing (BA) workers on strike. Analysts expect GE Aerospace's quarterly revenue to rise to $9.35 billion from $8.41 billion a year ago, when GE Aerospace was still a part of the General Electric conglomerate. The former GE division split from the energy-focused GE Vernova (GEV) earlier this year, while GE HealthCare (GEHC) was spun off last year. Shares of GE Aerospace have surged over 40% since the April 2 split from GE Vernova. Analysts expect the stock could rise further, with all of the eight analysts tracked by Visible Alpha holding "buy" or equivalent rating and an average price target of $210.38, implying about 9% upside from Thursday's intraday price of $192.84. Bernstein analysts, recently raising their price target to $225 from $201, wrote GE Aerospace could be "well-positioned for the short, medium, and long-term" because of its combination of new engine sales and its "huge installed base" of existing engines, "which drives a powerful, profitable aftermarket." However, GE Aerospace faces a "key question" in this quarter's earnings report, as the analysts said investors will be looking for details on how much of an impact the ongoing Boeing strike will have on production, which could impact GE's engine sales. Deutsche Bank analysts also raised their price target to $235 from $212 earlier this month, and said GE Aerospace remains one of their "top ideas" in the aerospace sector.

On 10/21/24, Caterpillar, Graco and Costamare will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Caterpillar will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.41 on 11/20/24, Graco will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.255 on 11/6/24, and Costamare will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.115 on 11/6/24. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of CAT's recent stock price of $393.62, this dividend works out to approximately 0.36%, so look for shares of Caterpillar Inc. to trade 0.36% lower — all else being equal — when CAT shares open for trading on 10/21/24. Similarly, investors should look for GGG to open 0.30% lower in price and for CMRE to open 0.81% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for CAT, GGG, and CMRE, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. Caterpillar: CAT Graco: GGG Costamare: CMRE In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.

Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

At Meta Connect in September, one of the newest products that caught my eye was a limited-edition pair of Ray-Ban glasses -- with a transparent frame, sapphire transition lenses, and a fairly accessible $429 price tag. Since I've already had great experiences with the Meta Quest 3 and Viture Pro XR glasses, I decided it was time to try the highly praised smart glasses by Meta. Fortunately, I was able to buy a pair right as stock ran out. Only 7,500 units were made available worldwide, and mine is number 4,255, marked on the inside of the right frame and on the charging case. ZDNET's Kerry Wan reviewed the standard Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, and after months of use, he still enjoys their functionality. As announced at Meta Connect, existing Meta glasses will also receive software updates, including natural language processing, the ability to remember and recall key information, live translations, and more. Also: I've tested a lot of tech in the past 6 months - the Meta Ray-Bans were the biggest surprise While deciding whether to make the purchase, I intended to use the glasses to capture video that's difficult to record accurately with a camera or smartphone. This includes testing watches, fitness gear, and e-bikes, as well as creating vertical short-form videos for YouTube and Instagram, with both hands free to interact with devices. I've used action cameras for some of this content before, but I wanted to see if a first-person perspective would result in better footage. Reviewed by ZDNET, the smart glasses can record videos, play Bluetooth audio, and perform useful AI tasks. I also spend time fly fishing, where both hands are occupied, and I want to capture video and still images of these experiences to share with family and friends who don't want to wade through cold rivers and catch small trout. My large, energetic cat demands daily playtime with wand toys, and now I can easily record his incredible acrobatics and funny antics on the go. It's been over two weeks since my Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Limited Edition glasses arrived, and they've exceeded my expectations. In addition to capturing great video while running with new watches, testing e-bikes, fishing, and playing with my cat, I've recorded a few fights on the ice at a local minor league hockey game, playful snow leopard kittens at the zoo, and my daily commute as the fall leaves turn under a glowing sunset. You can now capture up to three minutes of video by setting that as the default length, and the audio quality during recording has been much better than I expected. Also: New Meta Ray-Ban AI features roll out, making the smart glasses even more tempting Beyond video and still capture, I now prefer using the glasses for calls and podcasts over my AirPods Pro while walking around downtown Seattle. Like the bone conduction headphones I use for running, the Ray-Ban glasses leave my ears open for better awareness of my surroundings, and the sound quality is good for podcasts and music. However, in heavy traffic, the sound can be too quiet, so a future version with bone conduction technology would be ideal. I also appreciate the various messaging options, especially being able to have messages read aloud and easily reply to friends and family. Keeping my phone in my pocket while commuting and wearing the Meta glasses feels like an optimal way to get around. I'm enjoying spending less time looking at screens and more time engaging with the world around me. The transition lenses are a game changer as well. They allow me to wear the glasses both indoors, where I listen to music, make hands-free inquiries with Meta AI, and handle calls and messaging, and outdoors, where I would normally switch to sunglasses. However, I wish the lenses would get a bit darker in full sunlight. Also: In a surprise twist, Meta is suddenly crushing Apple in the innovation battle - Prism The Engo 2 Photochromic glasses have improved my running performance by displaying key health stats, and it would be fantastic to see similar functionality in a future version of the Meta glasses. Even being able to ask Meta for running stats would help me keep my eyes on the road and stay focused on my goals. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase of this Limited Edition model of the Meta Ray-Bans, which is designed to give me a glimpse into the underlying technology. And I'm even more excited about the added utility that future updates will bring.

The consensus price target is $732.26, about a 4% premium to to Wednesday's $702 close. The price targets used to determine that average vary from $550 to $820. Analysts expect the streaming giant to post year-over-year revenue, profit, and subscriber growth ahead of the final quarter of 2024. Netflix shares dipped following the company's quarterly reports in April and July. The shares were down more than 1% in morning trading, leaving the stock up more than 40% this year.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Nuclear energy is currently attracting exorbitant interest to meet the soaring demand from data centers throughout the continental US as the nation prepares to tap the century-defining potential that AI offers. Now, Craig-Hallum has upgraded the stock price outlook of NuScale, citing its regulatory head start and "a meaningful pipeline and customer list, including in AI/data center applications." Connect the Dots A. Google announcement a few days back.B. Microsoft with 3 mile island.C. Ellison? Oracle with 3 SMRs.D. Apple and META are next! — Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) October 16, 2024 The so-called Mag 7 companies have been aggressively pivoting towards nuclear energy in recent months to meet their soaring energy demands from AI-related workloads. By now, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon have all announced their plans to tap nuclear energy via either the conventional route or the so-called SMRs, which are small-scale, modular reactors, with an as yet unproven track record. Moreover, it appears increasingly likely that Apple and Meta might also announce their nuclear-focused deals soon. also known as the "Next AI Trade", or "Power Up America", laid out to subs in April. This is the best performing basket of 2024, outperforming even the Broad AI tradehttps://t.co/3WxL99fSed https://t.co/ovOOjMtaAl pic.twitter.com/ngeAtKsR6C — zerohedge (@zerohedge) October 16, 2024 In fact, so fierce is this nuclear-focused tailwind at the moment that it has been dubbed the "next AI trade." According to HSBC, data centers can account for 9 percent of the total electricity consumption in the US by 2030. Logically, nuclear energy provides the only sustainable, zero-carbon option to meet this oncoming demand. NUSCALE POWER $SMR price-target raised to $21 (from $16) at Craig-Hallum, saying a nuclear power "renaissance" is underway, and we are at the beginning of a "multi-decade megatrend": "A nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 17, 2024 This brings us to the crux of the matter. Craig-Hallum has now raised NuScale's stock price target to $21 per share, citing a secular tailwind from a nuclear power "renaissance" that is likely to evolve into a "multi-decade megatrend. The investment bank notes: "As part of this shift, small modular nuclear reactors have a real place in multiple applications, especially in support of the urgent need for zero-emissions baseload power for AI/data centers." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, SMRs pair high energy densities with a reliable, zero-carbon power output, making them ideal for data centers. Like all fission reactors, SMRs use a controlled nuclear chain reaction to produce steam that then drives turbines. Increasingly, companies such as Oklo are adopting liquid metals as coolants in their reactors. Most SMRs, however, require low-enriched uranium (HALEU) as the primary fuel, which is in short supply at the moment, given the sanctions on Russia. Do note that NuScale experienced a considerable setback recently when the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) terminated the company's only SMR project, which was also the first of its kind in the US, citing cost overruns. However, the company continues to develop projects in South Korea and Romania. Coming back, Craig-Hallum states in its investment note that is out today: "Activity over the last few months has been building and reached a fever pitch over the last few days with high-profile nuclear announcements (including SMRs) by Google and Amazon." It goes on to note: "While not involved specifically in either deal, we see NuScale as ideally positioned for an acceleration of nuclear/SMR adoption with a 5+ year regulatory head start and a meaningful pipeline and customer list including in AI/data center applications."

Title: The Dow rises 150 points on strong retail sales and surging AI stocks

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Thursday morning, driven by robust retail sales data and a rally in chip stocks. Consumer spending saw a notable increase in September, reflecting growing economic momentum following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% for the month, an improvement over August’s unchanged 0.1% gain and surpassing the 0.3% rise predicted by economists. In addition to the boost in consumer spending, the labor market continued to display resilience. Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000—a drop of 19,000 from the previous week and below the forecasted 260,000. This decline signals sustained strength in the job market. In the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129 points, or 0.3%, to 43,207. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AI and semiconductor stocks were among the day’s top performers. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%), Micron Technology (MU-1.86%), and Broadcom (AVGO+0.06%) gained 3%, 3.9%, and 4%, respectively, as investor optimism in the sector continued to grow. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.52%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.51%). TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Expedia (EXPE+2.25%) stock is climbing Thursday morning after a report that Uber (UBER+1.64%) has looked at buying the travel booking company in what would be its largest acquisition yet. The Financial Times on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the process, reports that Uber has met with advisors in recent months after a third party brought up the idea. A focus of those discussions, which the Times says are still at a very early stage, was Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined Uber 2017. — Rocio Fabbro and William Gavin contributed to this article.

Title: College basketball rankings: CBS Sports Top 100 And 1 best teams for the 2024-25 season

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The hope. The anticipation. Sneakers squeaking. Basketballs bouncing. Whistles chirping. Coaches already in full-throat before the season is in full throe. Find a quiet spot and, if you really try hard enough, you'll hear college basketball building for its long-awaited return in the first week of November. College hoops season is less than three weeks away, but more than 360 teams across the United States have been ramping and tuning up for weeks. We're all just about ready to tip this thing off — and angst grows as we lurch toward Nov. 4. Once the games begin, we can only hope the phantasmagoric will arrive as scheduled — but without a hint of its imminent entry, for maximum impact — as this beautiful mess of a sport is sure to take us on another great journey of joy, shock and madness. Ah, we know it will. We just don't know the when, who, how or why. That's why we love this sport so much. Before we get another college basketball campaign going, let's zoom out and lock in. As has been the case for a decade now, I've foolishly and enthusiastically taken to a master preseason ranking of teams. My methods are uncomplicated but diligent: examine the rosters, check in with coaches for intel, evaluate programs based on recent success (or a lack of it), factor in (and try to discern) inevitable surges and fades, and mostly avoid preseason metrics as to not be influenced by the (often accurate) biases of algorithms. Oh, and: Be sure to just let a few inexplicable predictions rip and hope for the best. A note on this year's process. With the Big Ten and ACC now 18 teams, plus the Big 12 and SEC beefing up to 16 apiece, I found myself wrestling a bit with how to place power-conference teams from about the No. 60 spot and below. Will we see the 79 teams from the power conferences (Big East has 11 and is also in that class) all mostly wind up as top-100 teams in most ratings systems by season's end? Will most of the 79 work their way into the top 70? Is the deck going to prove to be stacked that much in their favor? Or will a dozen-or-so mid-majors break through and find themselves ranked in the top 60? I think that's still possible, and my predictions reflect that, but if it skews toward the big boys in massive ways, I'll take that into consideration a year from now. I want to see how this new world of mass high-major expansion impacts the universe of college hoops, however that winds up playing out. Once more unto the breach, away we go! In what feels like a wide-open season just over the horizon, I'm taking a team at No. 1 with the preseason national player of the year; a team that brought in one of the best transfer classes of the offseason; a team that is adding multiple five-star freshman; and a team that had the No. 2-ranked offense last season en route to the Final Four. Alabama. The Tide are in the rare spot of having the men's basketball band ranked higher in the preseason than the football fellas, just the eighth time that's happened and the first time since 2006. (Bama football was No. 5 in the preseason.) Alabama, of course, is coming off its first Final Four in school history. Now it's going to try to become just the fourth SEC school (joining Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky) to make back-to-back Final Fours. Remember, the Tide was wicked unpredictable on defense last season, but survived in the NCAAs despite that, beating trendy Charleston and 30-win Grand Canyon before upsetting No. 1 UNC and then pushing past Clemson in the Elite Eight. Ultimately, Alabama lost by 14 to UConn in the national semis, which was the Huskies' smallest margin of victory in the NCAAs. Nate Oats did this after losing his entire staff the previous offseason, in addition to the Brandon Miller debacle. Now he's got one of the strongest rosters in the sport, led by CBS Sports Preseason Player of the Year Mark Sears. The inventive lead guard averaged 21.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists. Returning with Sears are two more fifth-year guys: Grant Nelson (11.9 ppg) and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (8.9 ppg), in addition to promising 6-11 sophomore Jarin Stevenson. Oats picked up notable transfers Chris Youngblood (15.3 ppg at South Florida), Houston Mallette (14.7 ppg at Pepperdine), Clifford Omoruyi (10.4 ppg at Rutgers) and a quisling in former Auburn guard Aden Holloway (7.3 ppg). Oh, and there's also two five-star freshmen in play: power forward Derrion Reid and center Aiden Sherrell. Bama has a loaded nonconference schedule (it plays Purdue, UNC and Houston, all top seeds last March, plus Illinois, Rutgers and Creighton, in addition to hosting a lot of really good mid-majors; it only has six non-con home games, the lowest of any high-major team in the country), so there's a chance the Tide accrues some losses that affect their standing in the human rankings. But I'm expecting this team to be a No. 1 seed and a clear title contender from Game 1. If Sears plays to expectations and the offense remains elite, this will be the best Alabama team in school history. A program that has finished No. 2 at KenPom.com three years running, so let's slot it right there again. Houston's averaged a nation-leading 30.2 wins the past six seasons, amassing 13 NCAA Tournament victories in that span. It hasn't lost more than five league games in a season in that span, including postseason play. The Cougars moved from the American to the Big 12 last season, and not only was there no drop-off whatsoever, the team seemed emboldened by its conference upgrade. A year ago, UH lost a First Team All-American (Marcus Sasser), only to produce another: Jamal Shead. Now Shead is gone (and had he not ripped up his ankle against Duke in the NCAAs, it's all too conceivable Houston would've been at the Final Four in place of NC State). The Cougars' next player in line for All-American status is senior L.J. Cryer, who averaged 15.5 points last season and should show his best yet. The Coogs also bring back proven players Emanuel Sharp (12.6 ppg), J'Wan Roberts (9.5 ppg), Ja'Vier Francis (6.0 ppg) and Joseph Tugler — a key defensive presence whose season ended in February. There's also Terrance Arceneaux, also coming back from injury and whose time surely must be coming. Milos Uzan, via Oklahoma, will be productive in a supporting role that won't require him to be an alpha. Kelvin Sampson's a proven commodity in college hoops. The Big 12 might be the best conference in the sport again, and while Kansas is rightfully getting a lot of No. 1 buzz heading into the season, I'll slightly side in that league with the program whose defense has been more reliable in the past half-decade than any other in college basketball. We're going to see a lot of good three-man cores this season, but Kansas could have the best in the sport: Hunter Dickinson, KJ Adams Jr. and Dajuan Harris Jr. They're all back and each does a variety of things different from the other two that will, again, make Kansas a national title threat. KU was supposed to be that a season ago, but the Jayhawks faced injury issues and withered down the stretch, finishing 27th at KenPom, its all-time low-water mark in that metric's 28-year database. The Jayhawks have reinforcements coming in, and the outlook is optimistic because AJ Storr (Wisconsin), Rylan Griffen (Alabama) and Zeke Mayo (South Dakota State) are all proven scorers AND shooters. Griffen could be near the top of the list of best 3-point snipers if his trajectory translates. KU also has top-20 prospect Flory Bidunga, a center, and four-star guard Rakease Passmore coming in. No Elmarko Jackson, though; he's out for the season with patellar tendon injury he suffered in June. The Jayhawks' biggest problem last season was depth. At one point, Self told me, he seriously debated whether or not to play his five best players together for about 36 out of 40 minutes in a game — and hockey-sub five bench players and try to survive that way. He never did it, but it would have been a fascinating approach. This team, knock on wood, will not need to be kept together with lattice. Dickinson is a preseason First Team All-American in this, his final season of college eligibility. Everything is in place for another great run in Lawrence. Most others in this scenario wouldn't sniff the top 10, solely because of the amount of unproven players that are going to step into new roles and more prominent tasks in Storrs. But UConn is different. Dan Hurley is even more different than different. I've got the Huskies at No. 4 because the program kept Hurley and won the angsty sweepstakes against the Lakers. The coaching staff is still entirely intact, too. And Alex Karaban, a two-time national champion as a starter on both teams, turned down the NBA for one more year in order to chase NCAA history. That's enough to give the Huskies the benefit of the doubt and place them this high heading into the season. Connecticut lost four starters (Tristen Newton, Donovan Clingan, Cam Spencer, Stephon Castle) who'll likely be replaced in the starting lineup by Hassan Diarra, Samson Johnson, Solo Ball and Liam McNeeley. The first three are returnees and McNeeley earned CBS Sports Freshman All-America honors. One guy who's probably going to earn a fair share of starts is Jaylin Stewart. Connecticut also picked up lead guard Aidan Mahaney from Saint Mary's. The two most recent back-to-back champions were Florida in 2007 and Duke in 1992. In the subsequent seasons, Florida went 24-12, made the NIT and was 8-9 vs. SEC opponents. It never reached No. 1 in the AP poll in 2007-08. The 1992-93 Duke team finished 24-8 and went 10-7 vs. ACC opponents. It lost to Cal in the second round of the NCAAs. The Devils spent five weeks at No. 1. Relatedly, we polled 100-plus coaches this summer and asked if they thought UConn would make a third straight Final Four: 68% said no. But the fact 32% said yes is incredible. Hurley is the face of college basketball and one of the most prominent coaches in American sports. He is operating at the peak of his powers, and knowing him, he's obsessed with proving people wrong and is probably sounding klaxons over being put fourth on this list. It will be absurdly difficult to win three national titles in a row. I can't wait to see this version of UConn and how the story plays out over the next five months. Another year, another loaded Duke roster? Yes, but this one includes the most hyped incoming prospect in a generation. Although Zion Williamson became a transcendent sensation, he wasn't expected to be a First Team All-American when he started at Duke; he wasn't even the highest-rated prospect on the team. (RJ Barrett AND Cam Reddish were both ranked above Williamson in 2018.) Now, Cooper Flagg, the CBS Sports Preseason Freshman of the Year, represents Duke's chance to recapture the nation's attention. He could be the best player in the sport … but he's also got a lot around him that may lead to a different reality. Flagg's certainly regarded as the top NBA Draft prospect heading into November. Fortunately, he'll have veterans to acclimate him, most notably junior point guard Tyrese Proctor, sophomore guard Caleb Foster and grad senior Mason Gillis, who comes by way of Purdue, bringing a lot of winning experience with him from West Lafayette, Indiana. Jon Scheyer enters Year 3. The pressure will be significant. He's done a really good job through the first two campaigns, but these next five-to-six months seem destined to feel a lot different. Expectations will be to win the ACC, then get a top-two seed in the NCAAs and to make the Final Four after coming one game short last spring. Proctor has to be more consistent. Flagg's fellow freshmen are all ranked top-30: Isaiah Evans, a lanky 6-foot-7 wing; Khaman Maluach, a 7-1 center from South Sudan who played in the Olympics; Kon Knueppel, a 6-5 shooting guard who might be the skeleton key for this offense; Pat Ngongba (currently dealing with a foot injury), a 6-10 power forward (the idea that he could be the eighth- or ninth-most important player on this team speaks to how loaded Duke is); and Darren Harris, a 6-4 shooting guard who most fan bases would be doing cartwheels over if he was on their roster. Scheyer also has Tulane transfer Sion James (14.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 38% from 3-point range), who will get a lot of run. Can Duke win big despite having so much youth, and how much youth will they rely on? The Blue Devils will be a national story every week, and whether you like, love or hate them, that's a good thing for college basketball. For the third straight year, I'm higher on the Bears than just about anyone you'll find. It's working out for me: BU has had a No. 1- or No. 3-seeded résumé the past five years (counting 2020 when that season ended). Scott Drew lost a LOT from last season, and he's also had some coaching turnover on his staff, but until I see true drop-off in Waco I'm not bailing on Baylor as a top-10 program. This year, I've slotted the Bears second in the Big 12 and easily in the Final-Four-contenders discussion. Drew will have to account for losing another lottery pick one-and-done guy (Ja'Kobe Walter) by ... bringing in another lottery pick one-and-done guy (VJ Edgecombe). There is a workable chance Edgecombe winds up leading all freshmen in scoring. He's receiving buzz already for how dynamic his game is. Real star potential. Whether he should or will be tasked with being Baylor's leader is another matter. Langston Love (11.0 ppg) and Jayden Nunn (10.5 ppg) are the two prominent guys back for the Bears. They'll play with Duke transfer Jeremy Roach in the backcourt. Roach has said he wants to be a pure point guard in this Baylor scheme. If that happens and he's an elite decision-maker, then Baylor will be a top-10 team. The Bears also got a crucial transfer in fifth-year player Norchad Omier, who flew up from Miami. Baylor's varying looks will be interesting. I expect a lot of small-ball with Omier at the 5, flanked by Edgecombe at the 4, Langston at 3, Nunn at the 2 and Roach playing the 1. If Omier plays power forward, then junior Josh Ojianwuna will step in at center. Robert Wright III and Jason Asemota are two more fresh bodies (and freshmen) who will see some time. Be patient with the Bears. No high-major team has a tougher first two games. They're playing Gonzaga in GU's backyard on opening night, then facing Arkansas in Dallas five days later. St. John's, UConn and Tennessee (potentially) are also on the schedule. Then it's Big 12 time. Similar to Alabama, this team could be better than its loss total indicates. Lose the best player in school history and stay a top-10 team? That's what great culture and elite coaching will do for you. That's what Purdue has. The only school to win more games over the past three years than Purdue is the one I have ranked at No. 2. The Big Ten — now a ridiculous, nobody-asked-for-this 18-school union — feels as hodgepodge as ever. But I'll take the Boilermakers to emerge at the top again. Three starters are back, the most important being Braden Smith, who could become a top-three point guard if this offense regenerates properly, Doctor Who-style, without Zach Edey. Purdue, in total, has 46% of its scoring back from last season's team that made it to the national championship. Look for Trey Kaufman-Renn to be THE breakout player in the Big Ten. In two seasons he's averaged 4.5 and 6.4 points. That number should double, minimally. Caleb Furst is also likely to bust from his shell. But this is Purdue, so let's talk centers. Who are the new towers in play? There's Daniel Jacobsen (7-4) and Will Berg (7-2). The Jesse Pinkman memes about Painter continually recruiting alien-sized players will continue apace once the games get going. Purdue has rostered a 7-footer 13 years in a row which, for all we know, is an all-time NCAA record. (If you know of a school that's had a 7-footer for 14 straight seasons, please find me.) Here's an intriguing note from Purdue: The team brings back 60% of its starting minutes from a season ago. Why does that matter? This is the 11th time under Painter that Purdue has brought back that much year-over-year. The eight most recent times Purdue brought back "at least 110 starts" from the year before, Purdue made the Sweet 16 in six of those seasons. Its winning percentage in those eight seasons: .789. That's really, really good. And given the growth of Smith and Fletcher Loyer, it should signal stability in the foggiest power conference in college basketball. Purdue has 113 league wins the past eight seasons. No high-major team claims more. Its Big Ten reign will continue by winning a fifth conference title in a nine-year span. The Volunteers had the second-best player in college basketball last season. Dalton Knecht will go down as one of the best up-transfers in college hoops history. From Northern Colorado to SEC POY. And Tennessee made a fun run to the Elite Eight before losing to the best player in college basketball. Rick Barnes not only lost Knecht, but also Jonas Aidoo, Josiah-Jordan James, Santiago Vescovi and Tobe Awaka. It's a lot! Maybe Tennessee suffers a plummet and proves to be, like, the eighth-best team in the SEC. But I'm gonna zag on that theory. I'll stick with the Barnes formula and register UT as the No. 2 team in the league. Critically, Zakai Zeigler's leadership at point guard is still in play in Knoxville. Zeigler can be a top-20 player nationally, buttressed by the fact that he's probably a top-10 defensive guard (at 5-8, no less). Zeigler's going to be at his best physically this season, and he'll pair in the backcourt with a North Florida transfer who hopes to be the next Knecht. His name is Chaz Lanier and he shot 44% from 3-point range last season while averaging 19.7 points. I like him to easily average double digits in the SEC. Barnes also brought on Felix Okpara from Ohio State, a quick-twitch center who could threaten to average three blocks and is a major reason why Tennessee will still be regarded as an SEC contender. I like sophomore J.P. Estrella to have a breakout season. Unclear whether he'll start in November, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he was hearing his name called in pregame by February. Due to the SEC's depth, accurately predicting even the 1-5 order of this league will be near-impossible. But until I see Tennessee significantly drop under Barnes, the Vols (as a regular-season operation) deserve the benefit of every doubt. Mark Few is feeling revitalized. He's coming off his time with Team USA at the Olympics, where he served as an assistant on the gold-medal winning team. It'd be no shock if Few picked up a few extra tricks from Steve Kerr and deployed some fun stuff in his offense in the months forthcoming. The Bulldogs are dinged slightly by the unfortunate loss — for the second year in a row — of small forward Steele Venters. The Eastern Washington transfer suffered an Achilles tear less than a year after rupturing an ACL. He figured to be a double-digit scorer. This being Gonzaga, I still think the Bulldogs find a way to have one of the best offenses in the sport for the ninth straight season. Graham Ike (16.5 ppg) will probably have the best season of his career; the timing is great considering this is his last one. Same goes for Ryan Nembhard, a fringe preseason All-America candidate who could threaten to average 15 points and 7 assists. Gonzaga has 81.4% of its minutes back from 2023-24, seventh-most in the country, according to BartTorvik.com. The only high-major program bringing back more is Notre Dame, per Torvik, and the only other two in the top 25 in terms of power-conference programs are Houston and Marquette. In bringing back more than 80% of the team's minutes, continuity should provide an easy transition and a likely 18th straight season with 25-plus wins. Guys like Nolan Hickman, Ben Gregg and Dusty Stromer should all play increased roles, while Pepperdine transfer Michael Ajayi (absolute hooper) and Arkansas import Khalif Battle (on his fourth school in four years, no less) reinforce GU's firepower and experience factor. The question is: Have we seen Gonzaga at its best, or does Few have another Final Four-level team in him? This one seems to have a shot. Fortunately, we don't have to wait to see the goods. The Zags play Baylor on opening night, thankfully giving college hoops a true marquee matchup to tip off the season. There's split opinion on how viable North Carolina is after losing one of the most productive players in school history, Armando Bacot, in addition to saying goodbye to double-digit scorers Harrison Ingram and Cormac Ryan. The most important player was RJ Davis, and lucky for UNC, the First Team All-American is using his COVID year for one last dance. Asking Davis (21.2 ppg) to recreate his impact from his senior season will be tough, but he might not have to in order to keep North Carolina in the top two in the ACC. Davis has company in the backcourt with familiar teammates Elliot Cadeau (expect a much better player this season), Seth Trimble and Jae'Lyn Withers coming back to Chapel Hill. Belmont transfer Cade Tyson (16.2 ppg) brings shooting reinforcements, while Vanderbilt big Ven-Allen Lubin is going to play with Jalen Washington to hopefully keep UNC's frontcourt somewhat respectable. UNC's lack of interior presence is the elephant in the room when we discuss the Heels' chances of being a national title contender. Ironically, I'm in on Carolina as a top-10 team because of its top two freshmen. It's counterintuitive in this final year of the bonus COVID year to think that 18-year-olds could be linchpin-type players, but that is setting up as the case here. Ian Jackson was ranked No. 8 in his class. The 6-5 2-guard from the Bronx could be a streaky shooter, but he's going to be a lot of fun as a potential sometimes-starter. Drake Powell (No. 11 in the class of 2024) is a guy I can't wait to watch. Powell's a strong wing, someone who could prove to be a high-level defender right away. It wouldn't surprise me if those two wound up being top-10 freshmen. UNC fell short of a second Final Four in three years under Hubert Davis, despite being a No. 1 seed, thanks to slamming into high-octane Alabama. Asking this group to build top-20 formats in offensive and defensive efficiency (which seems plausible as far as I'm concerned) should equate to Carolina again being in the Final Four mix. Things get going early: Nov. 8 at Kansas is a wonderful matchup in the first week of the season. Then UNC will test itself in Maui in that loaded field before eventually facing the likes of Alabama, Florida and UCLA in December. This team is going to take losses but will solidify itself to tussle with Duke atop the ACC. Let's just buy the ticket and take the ride. This is admittedly an aggressive spot for the Johnnies, who are coming off the shocking non-inclusion to the NCAAs. Not just that — St. John's wasn't even in the first four out after giving UConn its closest game in all of March and April. The Red Storm went 20-13 with a 4-10 record in Quad 1 and 3-1 in Quad 3. It wasn't enough. Now it needs to be better than an 11-9 team in the Big East that's sitting in fifth. I think it clears that bar with ease in '24-25. Rick Pitino is going to be a mad scientist making sure this team is nowhere near the bubble, despite the departures of Daniss Jenkins, Joel Soriano, Jordan Dingle, Chris Leldum and Nahiem Alleyne. They merely combined to average more than 57 points per game no biggie. My favorite conspiracy theory is Pitino went to Kentucky's Big Blue Madness and donned a UK sweater, whipping up multiple fan bases into a tizzy, knowing all the while he's got a team that's going to kill it this season. So, who's stepping up? RJ Luis (10.9 ppg) is the most important returnee, though I'd bank on Simeon Wilcher (2.8 ppg) quadrupling his scoring output in his sophomore season. He was a good team player, but now it's time to embrace a much more prominent role. Not as prominent as Kadary Richmond, who crossed enemy lines and made the switch from Seton Hall to SJU. Richmond will be on the short list of preseason Big East player of the year honors after averaging nearly 16 points at the Hall and scoring more than 1,200 points in his career. I think he's a dark horse choice for NPOY, too. Richmond will be set up by a great portal get in Deivon Smith, who averaged 13.3 points, 7.1 assists and 6.3 rebounds at Utah. Just a huge add there. Another key name is Vincent Iwuchukwu, who could benefit from a change in scenery after giving it an honest go the past two seasons at USC, following his heart scare in the summer of 2022. Look for Iwuchukwu to back up Zuby Ejiofor at the 5 and for North Texas 4-man Aaron Scott to be the first player off the bench. I love the talent blend and obviously trust the coaching. This could be UConn's biggest challenger in the Big East, and after last March's fireworks at MSG, who doesn't want to see more of that? Longtime readers know (and love?) my penchant for taking a few big swings every year in my top 25. Similar to St. John's, I am all the way in on Wake Forest: Top 15 Team. I'm just as in on the idea that lead guard Hunter Sallis will become a First Team All-American after bypassing the NBA Draft. Sallis averaged 18.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists and shot 40.5% from 3 last season. He's the latest transfer to downright thrive in Steve Forbes' system. Did Forbes land his transfers based on his reputation for being a portal whisperer? "Oh, without question — because they were offered way more money by other people," Forbes told me last season. "You have to have some (NIL), you can't just come in here empty handed. But, Hunter made a business decision. He did his homework." Sallis' jolt of confidence has Wake Forest's fanbase feeling more beatific heading into a November than it's been in a decade-plus. Sallis is super-receptive to coaching, has an insatiable work ethic and everyone in the program follows his lead. This year, Sallis carries Wake into the upper echelon of the ACC and gets the Deacs to the NCAAs, snapping the school's eight-year drought. He returns alongside another key Deacon, Efton Reid. If Reid can avoid foul trouble, he could emerge as one of the best bigs in the conference. Cameron Hildreth is also back in the starting lineup, effectively playing a third guard. The point? That will be Ty-Laur Johnson (Louisville), but given this is Wake, new bodies abound. App State transfer Tre'Von Spillers will play the 4, while Omaha Biliew (Iowa State) and Davin Cosby (Alabama) will also be getting plenty of run in their new surroundings. When Wake Forest is wrecking teams, remember who was first aboard the ship. Like pretty much every Marquette fan, I'm a convert to the notion that Shaka Smart is in the perfect place for what he wants to achieve in his career. The Golden Eagles are averaging 25 wins per season through Smart's first three years. I think they hit that number in Year 4 … but I also must draw attention to the reality that this will be Smart's first season at MU without Tyler Kolek in the locker room. His leadership and presence helped cement the foundation for Smart's vision of a reborn Marquette program. Now Kolek's off in the NBA and soon to be playing in a building he once won a championship in: Madison Square Garden. The Golden Eagles should still be one of the Big East's best because they do in fact return their leading scorer. Kam Jones and his 17.2 points per game are still here, flanked in the backcourt by Stevie Mitchell and Chase Ross. Underestimate that troika at your own peril. Forward David Joplin is also back, and yeah this is the place where I remind you that Smart opted not to bring in a transfer yet again. He's making it work. Against the rip tides of the sport, Smart is pulling this off. (Big man Ben Gold is about to have a breakout season as well, you can practically smell it.) If this prediction proves correct and Marquette winds up with a No. 4 seed or better for the third straight season, Smart's going to be able to charge outrageous public appearance rates to speak at coaching clinics across the country. They've got something really strong going, and with nearly 73% of the team's minutes still here from a season ago, it's more than fair to give this lot the benefit of the doubt following two seasons in which they finished 13th and 10th at KenPom. After three seasons and 88 wins in the Pac-12, Tommy Lloyd now takes his high-octane offense into the Big 12. The Wildcats figure to be one of the five best teams in that outstanding conference — something reflected in the preseason AP Top 25, where Arizona ranked fifth among Big 12 teams but was still ranked 10th. (Damn.) It's practically unheard of to have five returning All-Americans in college basketball in this generation, but that's what we're getting. One of those five is the final Pac-12 (As We Knew It) Player of the Year: Caleb Love. He's back for one more season, which means Arizona will be irresistible to watch. Love had some really good moments last season, in addition to the expected dose of Anything Could Happen On This Possession (Watch Out!). Also returning: Jaden Bradley (love his defense; crazy underrated player) and KJ Lewis (big breakout potential as a sophomore). Those three will be Arizona's backcourt, and they'll start alongside 7-2 sophomore Motiejus Krivas and Horizon League POY Trey Townsend, who helped Oakland to that charmed Cinderella run. Lloyd should get some frontcourt insurance from Tobe Awaka, who arrives after playing for Tennessee. Reports out of Tucson also indicate Anthony Dell'orso and Henri Veesaar have been absolute studs, with freshman Carter Bryant exceeding expectations, too. It will be enticing to see how this team adapts to the Big 12. Is Arizona going to come in and be as good in its first year the way Houston was last season? That wouldn't be a shock, but I'm going to stop short of that. I like a team in the 3-5 seed range that yet again will rank near the top of the most watchable offenses in choops. This is going to feel refreshing for everyone. John Calipari's time at UK needed to end. He did a lot of great things there, but the program was aching for a reboot. In comes affable alum Mark Pope, and what a flip this has been. Big Blue Nation went from despondent to delirious over the course of 48 hours after his hiring became public, a fan reaction reversion the likes of which I can't ever recall. So, how will the Wildcats look under new management? Pope has seemingly assembled a 10-deep roster without holding on to a single player who was in uniform in Lexington last season. My best guess at the opening day starting five: Kerr Kriisa (WVU transfer), Lamont Butler (SDSU transfer), Andrew Carr (Wake Forest transfer), Jaxson Robinson (BYU transfer) and Amari Williams (Drexel transfer). Those five combined to average 60 points last season. First off the bench figures to be 3-point specialist Koby Brea, who might even play his way into the starting role. Brea's commitment to UK solidified this roster's validity as top 25-quality. Pope also has Ansley Almonor (16.4 ppg at Fairleigh Dickinson), Otega Oweh (11.4 ppg at Oklahoma) and Brandon Garrison (7.5 ppg at Oklahoma State), with Garrison's long-term potential being a building block for the Pope era. Freshmen Collin Chandler, Travis Perry and Trent Noah will give the UK staff a deployment that's deeper than just about any roster Calipari had at Kentucky. (Notice I didn't write "more talented.") With games against Duke, Gonzaga, at Clemson and vs. Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic, the Wildcats will be tested regularly. I can't wait to see how this behemoth of a program is reborn with a vastly different personality calling the shots. I got to spend an afternoon this spring at UCLA, and one of the big takeaways for the year ahead was how connected and mature the group was in Westwood. Mick Cronin needed this, you'll recall, because he was as vocally critical of his team as any coach last season. (To the point where some in college basketball wondered if he was looking for a way out. UCLA went 16-17 and was a huge letdown. Cronin had never been so out of answers.) Turns out, things weren't so bad as to have a roster revolt. Three players that combined to average 37 points last season are back: point guard Dylan Andrews, shooting guard Sebastian Mack and small forward Lazar Stefanovic. UCLA is also bringing back the 7-3 Aday Mara who, with Zach Edey gone, will be among the tallest players in the sport. There's more, of course. UCLA actually had NIL resources during this past cycle, so expect Cronin to go 10-deep thanks to bringing on five transfers that averaged double-digit scoring, led by Tyler Bilodeau (14.3 ppg at Oregon State) and Dominick Harris (14.3 ppg at Loyola Marymount). From 2020-23, Cronin had offenses that ranked 11th, 12th and 21st in efficiency at KenPom. Last season it cratered to 152. I'd be shocked if this group didn't at least get into the top 40 and with a team that is more 3-point reliant than any of Cronin's previous squads at UCLA. There might be some small sacrifice on the defensive end (which Cronin will understandably resist), but it's a worthwhile trade-off to get UCLA back into the top-25 conversation. I'm bullish on the Bruins in their first year in the Big Ten. The Bluejays clear a preseason top-20 designation thanks to getting resolute big man Ryan Kalkbrenner back for a fifth and final season. Kalkbrenner is the early automatic frontrunner for Big East defensive player of the year, which doubles in selling him as a top-five defender in the sport. (He's won DPOY in the Big East three years running and will tie Patrick Ewing's mark of four in a row if he does it again.) Big Kalk averaged 17.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 3.1 blocks for a borderline top-10 team. It won't be easy, but mark me down for it: He betters all of those numbers in '24-25. Fortunately, Kalk is back with Mason Miller and Steven Ashworth also returning to the fold. That's critical in Creighton's quest to capture top-three status in the Big East for a sixth time in a seven-year stretch. It won't be easy due to the losses of Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander, both of whom are now in the NBA. And I wonder about CU's depth. The big portal get was Pop Isaacs, who averaged 15.8 points in a clattering season at Texas Tech. Isaac Traudt should be a growth prospect as a movable 4-man in Greg McDermott's system. Every year we get a handful of teams that are capable of only playing seven guys yet maintain nationally ranked status. I think the Jays are going to clear that bar, extending one more year in what's unequivocally been the best stretch of success in program history. Switching from Juwan Howard to Dusty May is going to be a near-180 culture overturn in Ann Arbor. Howard ultimately closed himself off to too many people and became too stubborn in trying to run a program. It redounded negatively on him to the point where AD Warde Manuel was effectively forced to go back on his word and fired Howard in March. In comes May, who won 126 games and averaged 21 wins in his six seasons at Florida Atlantic, which is outstanding considering the embarrassing lack of history and resources he embraced when he got that job in 2018. Michigan won out over Louisville and Vanderbilt for May's services, and I'm ranking U-M higher than just about anyone because the transfer haul feels like an ideal combo of size, shooting, speed, athleticism and proven commodities. Only one player followed May from FAU: center Vlad Goldin. He'll play alongside Yale transfer Danny Wolf, who could wind up as one of the five best up-transfers in college hoops … if Goldin doesn't rank ahead of him. Wolf can play the 3, 4 or 5 and is an A-level passer, screen-setter and space eater on the interior. Michigan also landed the underrated Sam Walters from Alabama, entering-his-prime Roddy Gayle Jr. from Ohio State, two-way competitor Rubin Jones from North Texas and sneaky-good 3-point contributor Tre Donaldson from Auburn. EvanMiya.com ranks Michigan's transfer class No. 5, which I might argue is too low. Scottie Pippen's son Justin is a freshman on this team, and the return of shooting guard Nimari Burnett and combo forward Will Tschetter should give May what he had at FAU: a roster that reliably is 10-deep and full of basketball-obsessed team players. I'm always good (or bad) for a smattering of zesty prognostications, so here's another. Boise State winning the Mountain West and becoming a top-20 crew feels as thrilling of a preseason call as almost any I've got listed. Leon Rice is over the moon at having a point guard who's his ideal kind of floor general. His name is Alvaro Cardenas. He was an intra-conference foil for Rice; Cardenas played for Tim Miles at San Jose State and averaged 13.2 points, 5.5 assists and shot 39% from 3-point territory. And he should be the key to unlock Boise State's latest NCAA Tournament team — and its first NCAA Tournament win in school history? We'll see. No program has made more Big Dances without a victory than the Broncos (0-10). BSU's best player is Tyson Degenhart. One of many instances where a high-major player is playing for a team outside the power-conference structure. Degenhart, a 6-8 senior, is the most practical preseason pick for MW POY. He might average 20/night on his way to becoming an NBA pick in 2025. Degenhart will again suit up alongside O'Mar Stanley, an undersized 5 who nevertheless played his way onto the all-league second team last season. On first glance, Boise State's roster doesn't shout "best in the Mountain West," but the buy-in at point guard and the physicality and versatility in the frontcourt has me believing in the Broncos. How big of a step back was last season? Consider that Indiana State finished 38th at KenPom, while IU was all the way at 91 and well out of the NCAA Tournament conversation. Despite making the Big Dance in years 1 and 2, Mike Woodson enters Year 4 on uneasy ground after the frustrations that sprouted like weeds emerged a season ago. The Hoosiers shouldn't even entertain outcomes that threaten Woodson's job security, though, not with the roster he's put together. IU brings back a 15-point-per-game guy in Malik Reneau (15.4 ppg), a 10.6 point-per-game vet in Trey Galloway, plus a likely sophomore burst from Mackenzie Mgbako (12.2 ppg). The Hoosiers, operating with a healthy NIL budget, also recruited Oumar Ballo from Arizona and Myles Rice from Washington State (two top-100 players), in addition to some others, like Kanaan Carlyle, who I'm eager to see in new surroundings after a nondescript season at Stanford. The 3-point shooting (or lack thereof) is a glaring concern, but most everything else screams top-20 roster. Can IU do it? Can it finish as a top-25 team for the first time in almost a decade? I can't shake the feeling this is going to be a noisy season (and that can be a good thing in many respects) for Woodson's program. One major letdown is the nonconference schedule, which is sorely lacking in must-see matchups. It also will give Indiana a lot less slack come conference play if IU falls short of winning the Battle 4 Atlantis. The Cyclones were unquestionably a top-10 team last season. The defense rated No. 1 at KenPom. The Clones destroyed inferior opponents on the regular and deserved a top seed instead of the No. 2 they got on Selection Sunday. That said, as I do every year (to varying results, yes!), I have to fade some teams in order to heavily buy in on some others in against-the-grain fashion. Mark me down for having ISU scootch back a bit in the bloated, beastly Big 12. The starting five will be led by one of the best guards in the country, Tamin Lipsey, who should be much more respected and discussed — to the level he deserves — by the time we get to Christmas. Lipsey will be flanked in the backcourt by senior Keshon Gilbert, who led the team in usage last season and probably will again this year. T.J. Otzelberger also brings back one of the more promising sophomores in the Big 12, Milan Momcilovic, who will play the 3. In the frontcourt, Saint Mary's transfer Joshua Jefferson and Charlotte newcomer Dishon Jackson will likely be starters. I'm wondering about the reliability up front, which is why I've opted to slightly sell on ISU's outlook. Overall, there's little question about this team's NCAA chances and its defensive pedigree. They can win ugly, but few care about style when the Ws rack up. This school should be dancing for the fourth straight year which would mark only the second time in program history that's happened. 10, 23, 14, 4, 8, 6, 6, 20. That's the final KenPom ranking for the No. 2 Big Ten over the past eight seasons. Illinois might be No. 2 this season, but it has been No. 2 (and sometimes No. 1) in the Big Ten over the past five seasons. Brad Underwood has a program humming, and that's a fact because he's made a habit of losing all-league guys and not falling too far behind. He'll carry on without Terrence Shannon Jr., Coleman Hawkins, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, Dain Dainja and Luke Goode. That's tons to overcome, but I have faith he'll do it thanks to some stars in the making that should find new life in Champaign. It will start with a guy I've been told has been insanely good in practice: freshman lead guard Kasparas Jakucionis. The Lithuanian could be a 2025 lottery pick. He'll join forces with Kylan Boswell, who averaged 9.6 points and 3.6 assists in a hot-and-cold two-year run with Arizona. Those two are the key, and they'll have help from Ty Rodgers and Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn, both of whom need to emerge as more consistent contributors. Carey Booth is a fledgling talent who couldn't get it going at Notre Dame. I like his chances to be a solid piece off the bench. Underwood also will bank on Ben Humrichous (14.7 ppg at Evansville) and Tre White (12.3 with Louisville) being minutes-eaters alongside two top-30 freshmen in 3-man Will Riley and 5 Morez Johnson. Illinois can be both the surprise and the reliable, pragmatic choice as a top-four finisher in the Big Ten. The tempting sleeper in the SEC. Todd Golden's Gators return three players (Walter Clayton Jr. and Will Richard in the backcourt, Alex Condon as a big) who averaged 20-plus minutes last season. They'll all be starters alongside transfers Alijah Martin (FAU) and, most likely, Rueben Chinyelu (Washington State). Martin committing to UF was a big-time add; he's an opportunistic scorer and is going to be one of the best man-to-man defenders in the SEC. With his Final Four pedigree, Martin figures to rise Florida's floor. Sophomore forward Thomas Haugh has also made huge strides in the offseason and will be the sixth man at worst. Clayton's savvy playmaking ability will likely lead to him being a top-four lead guard in the SEC. He's high-IQ, no doubt, and now the goal is to perk his 3-point accuracy from 36% and change to that ever-coveted 40% threshold. The Gators haven't yet returned to that upper-echelon SEC program that they could claim for a good portion of Billy Donovan's time, but Golden has the temperament and intellect to get there. Surprising though it may seem, Kansas State is now one of the biggest players in the transfer market. That was proven when Jerome Tang's program landed what's acknowledged as the most expensive portal get of 2024: Coleman Hawkins. The price? North of $2 million. The longtime Illinois stretch 4 will need to be one of the 20-or-so best players in American to both validate his NIL tag and lift K-State to top-25 status. I believe he will, and that's why I have the Wildcats ranked accordingly. Tang also brought on Achor Achor from Samford, Dug McDaniel from Michigan, Ugonna Onyenso from Kentucky and Max Jones from Cal State Fullerton, where he quietly/reliably averaged 15.3 points. Villanova transfer Brendan Hausen also will play north of 20 minutes per night. It's a big roster changeover, one of the starkest of any Power Five program that didn't undergo a coaching flip in '24. Tang was heavily courted by Arkansas but turned down the Razorbacks. He's where he wants to be and no question has the talent to get back to the Big Dance after missing out last year. Who amongst us can't wait to see John Calipari's final phase in Fayetteville? The Razorbacks' new coach returns just one player from the Eric Musselman regime, but he's a key one: Trevon Brazile. The stretchy 4-man opted to stick around for a rebuild that has some attention-grabbing parts. DJ Wagner followed Calipari from Kentucky, as did Adou Thiero and Zvonimir Ivišić. The latter two will be complementary pieces who could shine from time to time, but it's Wagner that seems to be the key. He took a backseat last season, despite starting, because of the dazzling play from Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. Those two are now in the NBA. Wagner hopes to be there a year from now, but the thing is, his style is close to Johnell Davis, who was an 18.2 ppg guy at FAU last season and is also on the Hogs' roster. That duo needs to learn to play off each other to give Arkansas a shot at landing in the top four of the SEC. And that's before taking into account that freshman Boogie Fland is also going to want the ball in his hands. Fland arrives alongside Karter Knox and Billy Richmond, all three switching allegiances from Kentucky shortly after Calipari fled for Hog heaven. Defensively, the Razorbacks will be viable for one man above all others: Jonas Aidoo. The Tennessee transfer averaged 11.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and was subsequently feverishly recruited in the portal. The class ranked No. 6 in the sport, per EvanMiya.com. To the shock of nobody, Calipari has recruited an enviable cluster of talent. He will have to embrace some late-career reinventions in order to dodge the flare-up of disappointments that became toxic in Lexington. Whether he's capable remains to be seen. But given who he convinced to follow him to Arkansas, this team has no excuse not to be one of the 30 best in college hoops. The last time MSU had a seed better than No. 7 was 2019 (though it would have been either a No. 2 or No. 3 in 2020). We're waiting on the return of vintage Michigan State. Will it happen in 2025? How many years does Tom Izzo still want to do this? Two more? Five? Whatever it is, I do expect Sparty to qualify for a 27th straight NCAA Tournament and for this team to be embedded in the strong and deep second tier in the Big Ten. A lot of pieces return from a 20-15 squad that ranked top-20 at KenPom. In fact, MSU is pretty well-stocked, considering Tyson Walker, Malik Hall, A.J. Hoggard and Mady Sissoko are all gone. Jeremy Fears, Jaden Akins (he's the key) and Tre Holloman all return and will combo for a three-headed backcourt that I'd like to see push the issue a lot more than last season's unhurried scheme. In the frontcourt, Coen Carr and Xavier Booker ready for their sophomore close-ups, and it sounds like Jaxon Kohler's role should spike. The roster looks like one breakout candidate after another. Plus, a family tree has been planted. Jase Richardson, a freshman, is the son of a guy who carries a pretty great legacy in East Lansing: Jason Richardson. Good group. Given it's Izzo, I openly admit to the very real possibility that I've under-ranked his group, I just want to see it come together before putting MSU into the top 25. The best news here is Johni Broome has a real chance to challenge a rival player on a rival team, Alabama's Mark Sears, for SEC Player of the Year. Broome averaged 16.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 2.2 apg, 2.2 bpg and was a 55% shooter for a 27-win Auburn team that finished (HELLO!) fourth at KenPom. Yes: fourth — despite losing to Yale in the first round — the best finish in school history, even if the Big Dance result didn't correlate. (Nugget: 2018 Virginia and 2016 Michigan State are the only other teams to ever lose in the first round and finish top-five at KenPom.) Now Bruce Pearl has a group with sites set again on winning the SEC, though as you can see I'm a seller on that idea. Every year there are a few teams ranked in the preseason that prove to be overshots, and I'll take a chance Auburn applies here. I already know the tut-tutting from Auburn fans is going to follow me well into the season. I've accepted it. For reasons hard to foresee, some teams just take steps back. Chad Baker-Mazara and Denver Jones return, and those two should be double-digit scorers alongside Broome. Furman's JP Pegues, who dropped 18.4 a night last season, will also squeeze in here as a viable option in Pearl's offense. The transfer class isn't great, though: EvanMiya ranks this class 70th in the country and second-worst in the SEC, a league so stacked that surprise results are unavoidable. And given how good Auburn's schedule is (Houston, the Maui Invitational, Duke, Ohio State, Purdue; it's loaded) in the noncon, it's going to take on some losses before what I think will be one of the toughest SEC slates in the conference. Sean Miller instantly steered Xavier back toward its typical realm of success in his first season (a No. 3 seed and a Sweet 16 run), but last year was a humbling downgrade. X went 16-18 and battled health issues en route to a forgettable campaign. For Year 3, the Musketeers have some dark-horse potential in the Big East, even despite the loss of starting center Lassina Traore, who is already done for the year with a knee injury. However, Zach Freemantle will be 24 years old and get a fully healthy final season, which should lead to him being among the best bigs in the Big East. Freemantle is, essentially, a returning starter. The only other player that's true of is Dayvion McKnight. The fifth-year senior averaged 12.4 points, 4.8 assists, 3.7 rebounds and shot 37.2% on his 3s. Because Xavier was a non-factor, McKnight was probably one of the most underrated players in the Big East. He'll shine. The Musketeers brought in Indiana State transfer Ryan Conwell, who could be Souley Boum-esque in terms of his impact. Excellent shot-taker who averaged nearly 17 points for a witty Sycamores squad last season. Toledo transfer Dante Maddox Jr. is also in line to start, given his numbers last season (15.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 40.2 3-pt%). Given Miller's coaching acumen and the fact there are 10 players on this roster who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players, it would be a semi-stunner if X wasn't easily in the NCAAs. It's wild times at Memphis these days, which is to say: everything's normal. Penny Hardaway's program is under NCAA investigation again, it's unclear what said investigation will lead to, and it's undetermined if Hardaway's actually on the hot seat or not. He made unusual late-offseason staff changes. The Tigers missed the NCAAs in March. Fan engagement is spotty, due in part to school administrators passing on an opportunity to leave the American for the Pac-12. (For now?) This is not a well-run outfit at present. But what about the basketball players? With Houston out of the conference, Memphis is the king of the league and is my pick to be the AAC's best — despite losing five key pieces. Hardaway's most important add would seem to be Tyrese Hunter, the former Iowa State and Texas point guard who is a reliable jump shot and two inches away from being an NBA Draft pick. He's going to team up with Tulsa transfer and top-shelf scorer PJ Haggerty. The frontcourt will feature a familiar name: Moussa Cisse is boomeranging back to the Tigers for his final season; he's a great rim protector and should help with Memphis' signature defensive edge. Dain Dainja comes by way of Illinois. I think he's a great get. The champion of the American should be a top-30 team. Based on talent, Memphis is the logical pick. The Bearcats will break through in Year 4 of Wes Miller's regime and make the NCAAs, ending a drought that dates back to 2019. Miller's team finished 39th at KenPom last season; a noticeable bump up is in order yet again. UC fans' patience will be rewarded. Miller has the benefit of returning enough above-average pieces to be a feisty team in the thick Big 12. There is no outright star here, but then again, that's the Cincinnati way more often than not. Jizzle James' breakout sophomore season is an expectation; the physical combo guard needs to make a jump to justify this ranking. But bringing back Day Day Thomas and Dan Skillings Jr. in the backcourt is just as important for the objectives in Cincy. Their style contrasted against Aziz Bandaogo's standout defense — he will be featured in the middle — is going to give the Bearcats some matchup advantages. Bandaogo will be assisted by Simas Lukosius, who can roam on the wing as one of the more dependable 6-8 3-point shooters in the league. The intriguing name is Dillon Mitchell, who is using his last year of eligibility and figures to start at the 4. BYU was the surprise metrics darling in the Big 12 last season. I sense UC could be that team in '24-25. Some might have expected the Red Raiders to drift into obscurity after the short-lived, disastrous end to the Mark Adams era. Not at all. Grant McCasland was the right guy at the right time. TTU went 23-11 and got a 6-seed in 2024 — doing so with an offense-first philosophy. It should be in that ballpark again in 2025. Two critical transfers to know: PG Elijah Hawkins (Minnesota) and JT Toppin (New Mexico). Hawkins was one of the best pure distributors in college hoops as a Gopher. Toppin is a bouncy wing that does a little bit of everything and broke Lobo hearts when he left ABQ. Adding those two in with three guys back (Darrion Williams, Chance McMillian, Kerwin Walton) who combined to average 30-plus points gives the Red Raiders a sleeper's chance at being a Big 12 contender. Devan Cambridge is also back, and on his way to being healthy. A lot of promise with this team. (NOTE: This ranking and capsule were published hours before Tony Bennett's retirement was publicly disclosed. Virginia's slot will remain the same for official purposes, but had I known UVa would not have Bennett on the sidelines, I realistically would have put the Cavs much lower in my rankings.) The Wahoos have made all but two NCAA tourneys since 2012, and I'm confident that broad track of success continues in 2025. But it's time for UVa to get back to making its mark in March; the program's last Big Dance victory was against Texas Tech in the 2019 title game. Last season, Virginia was a no-show vs. Colorado State in the First Four. Losing Ryan Dunn and Reece Beekman early to the NBA (borderline priceless defenders) drops the Cavs' ceiling and essentially forces them out of top-25 consideration heading into November. Virginia brings back shooting guard Isaac McKneely and his reassuring 44.5% 3-point accuracy. Big man Blake Buchanan is situated for a breakout year and he's not going to be the only one in Charlottesville. The portal add who could be requisite to Virginia finishing in the top five of the ACC is a guy who was in the league last season, but barely made a mark. TJ Power opted out of Duke, knowing full well just how much talent was coming in. At Virginia he can become one of the breakout sophomores, provided he's bought into the program's defensive requirements. Anthony Grant is 135-55 in his last six seasons at UD, equating to a magnificent .711 winning percentage, the best in the Atlantic 10 in that span and one of the 15 best of any men's Division I coach. It's for that reason, above all others, that I will again forecast Dayton as the best team in the conference. The Flyers are the most consistent team in that league. There are some lowered expectations because of the loss of DaRon Holmes II, but UD fans have seen their team overcome significant losses of NBA-level talent before. Thankfully, Malachi Smith's return from injury should inject renewed optimism in Dayton, going along with the return of preseason A-10 first-teamer Nate Santos. Santos, Enoch Cheeks and Javon Bennett are the support columns, but it's the transfers that make me all in on Dayton's return to the Big Dance. (UD is coming off an NCAA appearance as a No. 7 seed, which included a win over Nevada in the first round.) The Flyers brought in former Ohio State big man Zed Key and well-traveled defensive specialist Posh Alexander, who are both old enough to be voting in a second presidential election. How a coach schedules tells me how confident he is in his team. UD is not only going to Maui, but Grant also has Marquette, UNLV, Cincinnati and Northwestern on the schedule. These guys might not be as good as last season, but I think they'll be relatively close. What encore is in store for the team that made its first Elite Eight in 44 years? The Tigers have a healthy chance at a fifth NCAA Tournament push under Brad Brownell (and it would be the first time ever under him that Clemson made back-to-back Big Dances) with the return of Chase Hunter at combo guard and power forward Ian Schieffelin. Had PJ Hall come back, Clemson would have easily been a preseason AP Top 25 team. Without him, they'll look to make up some ground and can get their bona fides on defense with Cincinnati transfer Viktor Lakhin. The Tigers will rely on Jaeden Zackery (11.2 ppg, 4.3 apg at Boston College) to be the primary 1-man. If he's efficient, Clemson can hope to be in the realm of last season's 117.7 adjusted offensive efficiency rating (per KenPom), a program-best number. I think the Tigers are a moving target in the ACC but am willing to give Brownell the benefit of the doubt and buy in on continued success and a top-five league finish for the fourth time in five seasons.. Randy Bennett's Gaels have won 26 or 27 games in four of the past five seasons, with the COVID-affected 2020-21 campaign being the exception. It's fair to brace for a little step back here, as Aidan Mahaney left for UConn and Alex Ducas graduated. Josh Jefferson also decided to portal it out of there. I love that Mitchell Saxen is here again for a fifth and final season, though. I'd rank him among the 15 best bigs in the sport. With Saxen and the 7-1 Harry Wessels making life hell in the paint, Saint Mary's is again going to be rugged and not to be trifled with on defense. And sure, the Aussie pipeline is still flowing into Moraga, California, but Bennett's also added a couple of Lithuanians to boot. Had Mahaney stayed it would've benefited the program, but SMC fans know that Augustas Marciulionis was the team's better floor general anyway. He's back for a senior season on a squad that is again going to firmly be No. 2 in the WCC behind Gonzaga. Oh, nothing. It's only the most anticipated season in Rutgers history. Steve Pikiell and his assistant, Brandin Knight, diligently worked for years to recruit two blue-chip studs — Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey — and here they are. Yes, Rutgers will suit up quite possibly two future top-five NBA Draft picks. This is going to be fascinating, to say the least. Harper will run the offense; he's the younger brother of Ron Harper Jr., who is one of the best players in program history. Bailey is a bouncy wing who might be the most athletic freshman in the country. Those two won't explicitly be tasked with being the leaders of this team, but from the outside in, that's how it will be viewed. Harper and Bailey all but guarantee a big jump from last year's putrid offense, which ranked 295th at KenPom. Harper gets the benefit of starting beside Jeremiah Williams, who started 11 of his 12 games last season after returning from injury. No one's quite sure how this is going to go, and questions loom with RU's interior defense, but few teams in '24-25 will rank as high in watchability as the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. What a world. I like this world! The Aztecs get a top-40 designation from me due to coaching stability and proven culture. This program lost a LOT from 2023-24: Jaedon LeDee (that one's gonna leave a mark), Lamont Butler, Micah Parrish, Darrion Trammell. The best returnee is Reese Waters (9.6 ppg, 3.7 rpg). A year ago, nobody had LeDee as a top-20 player in the country, but that's precisely what he became. Can Waters make a jump that's in that ballpark? He'll get help with Miles Byrd, a stretchy wing who symbolizes a lot of what makes SDSU's defense so firm year in, year out. One new name to know is former FAU guard Nick Boyd, who has a swagger on the court that will fit right in with Brian Dutcher's program. Boyd might be good for a couple of 25-point nights, and in turn, could improve the Aztecs' chances at winning yet another Mountain West title. The MW will soon degrade, due to SDSU leaving alongside a few other teams. In these next two years, it should be a compelling battle for supremacy before this league is subdued — so soon after its best season in history. With a workable troop of fourth- and fifth-year players, plus the arrival of a five-star big man, the Terrapins can course-correct in a big way from last season's letdown. Kevin Willard's team was a confounding 16-17, done in by awful 3-point shooting and a stagnant offense. Look for that to change due to the arrival of Belmont transfer Ja'Kobe Gillespie (38.7% from beyond the arc) and South Florida import Selton Miguel (39%). Maryland lost Donta Scott and Jahmri Young, but Julian Reese is back in the frontcourt and will play the 4 alongside freshman center and local high school hero Derik Queen, who ranked 12th in the Class of 2024 according to 247Sports. Reese's defense should help Maryland rank well nationally in efficiency. I don't know if Queen will be high-impact in the first six weeks of the season, but I think he rounds into form by February and gets Maryland firmly into the bubble mix. The Longhorns' shift into the SEC (this feels like it's going to take some getting used to) is going to coincide with a big shift in the roster. A lot of old hands are no longer wearing burnt orange: Max Abmas, Dylan Disu, Tyrese Hunter, Dillon Mitchell, even Brock Cunningham (gone already? I jest) have moved on. That equates to 80% of the team's minutes flipping for the season ahead. Rodney Terry essentially has a rebuild on his hands, but at least he's got a terrific freshman wing in Tre Johnson to do it with. Johnson is the sleeper pick to be the nation's best freshman. Ranked sixth overall in the class, he was a big-gulp scorer as a prospect and figures to have a lot of touches on a team that will be looking for guys to step up on offense. Johnson figures to start alongside four other guys who are all much older and seniors/fifth-year players. Kadin Shedrick is the most important returning UT player; he'll hold down the 5. Arthur Kaluma is in Austin to chase the NCAA Tournament after missing out last year at Kansas State. Tramon Mark is back in the state after a one-year detour with Arkansas. Look for him to be critical as a leader for Terry's team, which has some interesting pieces. I can see a way for Texas to make hay in the new-look SEC, but it's likely going to be in the bubble mix come March. It's hard to catapult season-ending momentum into the following campaign, but let's see if Pitt can do it. I like the Panthers to be a bubble team after missing out (narrowly) on the NCAAs last season following a 10-3 finish and a 22-11 record. Jeff Capel is now in Year 7, with one NCAA trip in the first six. Pitt's AD was unexpectedly let go this offseason, which could put Capel's job at risk if he severely underachieves, but I like this team to comfortably finish in the top half of the ACC and make the Big Dance. The Panthers have somewhat quietly moved into second-tier status in the ACC in the past couple of years. Will this group keep that going? The roster suggests a competitive team with a reasonable shot at winning north of 20 games again. Ishmael Leggett is a key player back, as is Jaland Lowe, who will be a pop guy in 2024-25, especially after Bub Carrington's meteoric rise to one-and-done NBA Draft lottery pick. Lowe could follow Carrington's course in 2025, honestly. Blake Hinson also no longer being here also dings Pitt a bit, but, but, but: The Panthers return four of their top six scorers, which is about as good of a situation as you can ask for at a high-major school that didn't make the tournament. If you missed Jackson Shelstad's freshman year, don't make a similar mistake this upcoming season. Shelstad (12.8 ppg) is probably among the 10 best sophomores in the sport, and he'll have a shot at being a first- or second-team guy in the Big Ten. (Still feels weird to type it, let alone read it.) Dana Altman was hoping to win an NCAA appeal to get one more season with N'Faly Dante, but that didn't happen. Who's the big man to step up now? Senior Nathan Bittle, who will have to pop his 10.0 points/4.4 rebounds line from last season. After a one-year East Coast junket at Villanova, former Washington State wing TJ Bamba has returned West to suit up as a Duck. I suspect he'll get north of 320 shots in 30-plus games. This is Dana Altman's 15th season in Eugene. The previous 14 featured 20 wins or more. In fact, Altman's coached 27 consecutive years above .500. Oregon might have question marks, but the track record mandates putting the Ducks comfortably in the top 50. I was absurdly high on the Aggies last season (we're talking irrationally high), only to see Buzz Williams' team pretty much perform where most others thought they'd be. A 21-15 record and a No. 9 seed. So: they were solidly solid, but a few matters short of pretty good. Will this group be more consistent? Wade Taylor IV returns for his senior season, and after averaging 19.1 points in 2023-24 (fourth-best in the SEC), he's got a chance to be No. 1 in the conference. A lot will filter down from Taylor's production. Fellow senior backcourt mate Manny Obaseki will be inserted into the starting lineup full time, getting that promotion along with another semi-starter from last season, Jace Carter on the wing. My concern with ranking A&M higher is tied to the reality that Williams is yet to have a quality shooting team in his five seasons with the program. Every one he's had has rated outside the top 150 in 2- and 3-point percentage, many outside the top 200. Until that changes, A&M is going to have a limit on its proficiency and efficiency inside the SEC and out. After losing out to Duke in the high-stakes dual recruitment of Cameron and Cayden Boozer (who will be in college in 2025), Jim Larrañaga now focuses most of his energy on reversing the bad vibes that concluded Miami's 2023-24 season, an unspeakable 10-game nightmare that rendered the Canes irrelevant at 15-17. Nijel Pack and Matthew Cleveland decided to stay in Coral Gables, Florida, and that will prove vital to Miami's chances to be a bubble team in the ACC. The Hurricanes lost a lot from last season's team, but those two were the ones they couldn't afford to see leave. Cleveland and Pack joining forces with a fun freshman, shooting guard Jalil Bethea, in addition to Stetson transfer Jalen Blackmon (who had the game of his life in the ASUN title game, erupting for 43 points and getting the Hatters into the field of 68) will ensure this squad is potent and powerful in shot selection and creation. Few teams underachieved harder relative to the talent on the roster than The U a season ago. I can't see Larrañaga standing for that again. It might not be as good as Miami's football team in 2024, but The U will be back in the better half of the ACC. What a highly unusual situation in Columbus. Chris Holtmann was fired on Valentine's Day and everyone presumed the Buckeyes would chase, and land, a buzzy name. (Dusty May was the presumed initial target.) But Jake Diebler went from interim to full-time coach, thanks to going 8-3 after moving over a seat. Diebler has done well in his first season in terms of roster assembly. Most importantly, Bruce Thornton stuck around for one more season with the Bucks. I think he's got a great chance to be a top-five player in the Big Ten. He'll team up with boomerang transfer Meechie Johnson, who is back in an OSU uni after two years with South Carolina. Diebler recruited two former five-star prospects who didn't pan out at the blue-blood level: Sean Stewart (Duke) and Aaron Bradshaw (Kentucky). They're likely to start with another transfer, an understated team guy, Micah Parrish of San Diego State, who will be a utility guy to say the least. Not having Taison Chatman (torn ACL) will ding Ohio State's depth in the backcourt, unless 6-foot freshman Juni Mobley emerges as one of the best 3-point shooters in the Big Ten with haste. Diebler as a head coach of a high-major with no experience other than February and March's abbreviated trial run will make this a TBD season. But the talent should have OSU a bubble team at minimum. A year ago, I aggressively placed Georgia in the top 50 of my rankings, which I'm brave enough to admit was a fatuous mistake. This season, it's not such a fable. The Bulldogs fully expect to be competitive and in the top half of the SEC, thanks above all to anticipated reforms with the team's rebounding. (It's been baaaaaad.) Mike White has two players back who will be starters in Silas Demary Jr. and Blue Cain. Demary really might be the most undervalued player in the SEC. Also key: White has a freshman in Asa Newell who is the most talented newbie to come onto that campus (for basketball, anyway) since Anthony Edwards. Newell's game is nothing like Edwards, however. He's lean, stands approximately 6-10, can step out and shoot and plays with a good head on his shoulders. He'll need to be a top-10 freshman in the country to validate my UGA ranking, and I think he's gonna pull it off. Look for Demary to step up and be one of the best defenders in the SEC — with backup De'Shayne Montgomery not that far behind. Tyrin Lawrence (via Vandy) and RJ Godfrey (via Clemson) should round out the starting five. Kim English is on a mission to not put PC in the position it was last season, when spotty metrics results wound up holding the Friars outside the velvet rope to get into the NCAAs. That team won 21 games and did so without Bryce Hopkins (while Devin Carter turned into the Big East Player of the Year). Hopkins is back, however, and approaching 100% status after tearing his left ACL. Look for the combo forward to increase his previous Friar averages of 15.6 ppg and 8.6 rebounds, and in the process, potentially become the most valuable player on a Big East roster. English dipped into the portal and added Bensley Joseph (Miami), Wesley Cardet Jr. (Chicago State) and Christ Essandoko (Saint Joe's) to help out returning guard Jayden Pierre (9.5 ppg). With Josh Oduro now in the NBA, watch Oswin Erhunmwunse step in and patrol the paint. Every year when I build out this list, there are invariably a half-dozen power-conference teams that feel like their range could be anywhere from No. 30 to No. 70. Providence is one of those teams this year. The Lobos were laughably only put into the Big Dance last season because they won the Mountain West tourney title after an enthralling run that included five wins in the final six games prior to March Madness. UNM's inclusion gave the Mountain West a conference-record six bids. This team probably can't match the firepower and athleticism of that one, but it can best it in tenacity and resourcefulness. Much of that will spring from junior guard Donovan Dent, one of the best players in the Mountain West. Dent, whose gumption is on display multiple times a night, averaged 14.1 points and figures to up that number in 2024-25. He'll have returning C Nelly Junior Joseph starting with him, giving Richard Pitino's team a couple of go-to guys in very different positions. I have to ding UNM for the losses of Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn Jr. and JT Toppin, but the program's arrow has been going in the good direction since Pitino arrived three years ago and doesn't seem likely to go crooked over the next six months. It's time for the Braves to ascend to the top of the Missouri Valley — and become one of the best mid-major teams in the process. Brian Wardle, in this his 10th season in Peoria, Illinois, has his best team. And consider: Bradley ranked 64th at KenPom last season. Thanks to returning much of his roster (led by point guard Duke Deen and 5-man Darrius Hannah), Wardle can rely on veteran experience and a locker room with great chemistry. The Braves have to overcome losing their leading scorer (Connor Hickman) and best defender (Malevy Lyons), but seem to have most boxes checked for a mid-major darling. Great size, culture established, good guard play, capable 3-point shooting. The Braves have two MVC tourney championships under Wardle but just one NCAA appearance because 2020 was ripped away. Drake had been the Cinderella candidate in the Valley in recent years, and now Bradley should take that mantle. The Blazers are equipped with four returning starters from a 23-win team. If Memphis doesn't wind up as the best team in the AAC, UAB (officially the preseason league favorite) is the obvious candidate to take the top slot. Any team that deploys a man in the middle with the first name Yaxel and a pesky guard nicknamed "Butta" figures to be set up for a certain level of success, deemed necessary by the basketball gods. Yaxel Lendeborg is a 6-9 hoss — a senior center who will threaten to finish with 25 double-doubles. Butta Johnson is a bit of a dynamo who should see his shot opportunities improve playing next to underrated Georgia Southern transfer Tyren Moore. UAB will be a problem in the American because Lendeborg is complemented by Christian Coleman, a power forward with a tough nose around the rim. Kennedy knows his team's defensive issues last season sold them short. We should expect a more well-rounded squad in Birmingham. Everyone knows the deal on the Main Line. Kyle Neptune needs to make the NCAA Tournament in order to get to a fourth year with Nova. The program has quickly gone from a rock-solid top-10 reputation to confounding disappointment over the past two seasons. Now the Cats ready for a campaign with only seven players holding D-I experience. Five of those seven, at least, are 21, 22 or 23 years old. Eric Dixon opted to stay, and that might be the thing that saves VU and keeps them competitive in the Big East. He and Jordan Longino will be the team's leaders, while Wooga Poplar (via Miami) was the Big Transfer Get that Nova desperately needed in the back end of the portal cycle. Villanova hasn't missed the NCAAs three years in a row since Jay Wright's first three on the Main Line (2002-04). In order to avoid that in 2025, Neptune's going to have to overachieve with a roster that ranks well outside the top five of the Big East. A program under pressure that has responded well in previous iterations. What will this one do? If you're outside the top 50 you probably aren't in as a bubble team come March, but I think BU is one of the best sleeper NCAA candidates out there. Thad Matta's toiled a bit for two years in Indy, yes, however his coaching acumen can't be questioned. By bringing back much of the roster from an 18-win team, the expectation should be to hit 20 victories. The two biggest names still here are G/F Pierre Brooks and F Jahmyl Telfort. They'll be wonderful on a team that should move into the top 50 of offensive efficiency. I do wonder about the defensive integrity and the lack of higher-end athletes. Tulane transfer Kolby King is a guy who will also emerge here, but needs to beef up into a strong two-way player to bolster the loss of Posh Alexander. A veritable mid-major beast these days. Bryce Drew's program is coming off a first-round upset of Saint Mary's in the 5/12 game, giving GCU a program-record 30th win in the process. The Antelopes were 65th in my rankings a year ago, which proved too low. I'm bumping 'em up that much more heading into November. Four starters return, led by Tyon Grant-Foster, a 20-point-per-game guard who is one of the three-or-so most talented mid-major players in the sport. If bringing back a healthy portion of the team's scoring and minutes wasn't enough to convince you this team can win another NCAA Tournament game, know that TCU transfer JaKobe Coles and his 42% 3-point accuracy is also in the mix here. The Lopes are overwhelming WAC favorites yet again before the program moves on to the WCC next year. Non-Rambler fans, If I ask you what this team's win total was last season, you think you can guess it within two spots? Loyola Chicago went 23-10 in a critical bounce-back campaign after the disastrous 10-win season the year prior. For as good and improved as LUC was last season, the program sure didn't seem like it received a fair amount of attention and publicity. Drew Valentine will need to have another 20-win season to get his flowers, and I'm here to project he will. Three starters are back at a program that retained five rotation players in all and should have the makings of a top-40 per-possession defense. Miles Rubin averaged just 6.2 points, but I don't know how many players who didn't score 10 per game were more valuable, at least at the mid-major level, than him. He set the program record with 76 blocks in a season. Rubin, Des Watson (high-end A-10 player) and Jayden Dawson will be the triumvirate taking on a not-so-mysterious-but-still-sorta-unpredictable top third of the Atlantic 10. The Ramblers upgraded to this conference from the MVC two years ago. This is the season they show they made the right decision. Here's a big swing. It was a slog in Year 1 under Micah Shrewsberry, as anticipated, but I'm tagging the Irish to be one of the more surprising high-majors in the months ahead. Shrews was able to retain four starters, the most important being point guard Markus Burton (17.5 ppg, 4.3 apg, 3.3 rpg at 5-foot-11). Burton gets to play beside a utilitarian transfer who should fit like a glove: Princeton guard Matt Allocco. ND brings back guys who don't have big Q scores but are highly valued on that campus: Tae Davis, Braeden Shrewsberry and J.R. Konieczny. The Irish are going to punch above their weight and steal a few games as a home underdog. The program's been on fire recently with some big-time recruiting wins. Notre Dame will likely be a projected NCAA team a year from now, but in this bridge season I like Shrewsberry's crew to go from 13 wins to at least five more than that in '24-25. With all due respect to the predictive metrics out there and how they're formulated and calculated, the Bulls team I saw last season looked better than the one listed online. USF ranked 87th at KenPom, 84th at Torvik, 78th at EvanMiya and 91st at BPI. I'm not going to say USF was a top-60 team last season, because the data's in and the data across different algorithms is correct. However, if you watched USF occasionally and saw how that fan base was reinvigorated, how well-coached it was under Amir Abdur-Rahim and its new life as a 25-win team, you saw top-50 aura. Despite Abdur-Rahim not taking a bigger job after just one year, but losing vital pieces regardless, I'm buying in with the Bulls. I think they play their way to a second consecutive 20-win season. I think they build on a fun story in Tampa. I think they do it behind lead guard Jayden Reid. He's an easy candidate for AAC POY consideration, and he'll likely be tasked with a lot after USF got poached in the portal. Reid has Brandon Stroud and Kobe Knox flanking him, giving the Bulls the uncommon situation of coming off a good year with returning pieces, but likely being underrated. (Except here, of course.) USF has a good policy in place: replace the departing coach with the best-qualified in-house candidate. It did this in 2019 when Kyle Smith left and Todd Golden scooted a seat over. Then, when Golden took the Florida job in 2022, Chris Gerlufsen was promoted from within. Since then, the Dons have gone 43-25 and maintained top-four status in the WCC, which is where they'll be again for the next five months. Gerlufsen is fortunate to return four high-leverage players from last season's 23-11 team: Marcus Williams, Malik Thomas and Ndewedo Newbury (all seniors), plus sophomore combo guard (and somewhat rare non-Gonzaga WCC freshman of the year winner) Ryan Beasley. This team wasn't free throw-prone a season ago, something that should change for the better. A nice offense is likely to upgrade to a good one, and the defense can again be top-60 in the nation. That will lay the course for USF's inside track to third place in the WCC behind Gonzaga and Saint Mary's. What Will Wade did to change the situation in mere months' time in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is outrageous. McNeese won 30 games last year and finished 67th at KenPom, by far its best ever. Prior to 2023-24, McNeese's average KenPom finish in its history was 257th; the Cowboys finished between 276 and 335 in the 11 preceding years. Then Wade arrives and all the suck and ineptitude is vaporized out of the program. McNeese had a 19-game turnaround, tying an NCAA record. And remember, Wade had to sit for the opening stretch of last season because of suspension. Of course, he's only there because of the NCAA violations and stain from his LSU days, but regardless, this is now a low-major monster. McNeese will rule the Southland with ease again. Look for Christian Shumate (awesome two-way player), Ole Miss transfer Brandon Murray and Saint Louis transfer Sincere Parker to guide the Cowboys to at least 25 wins again. THE story with Wisconsin is how it fares after being brutalized by the portal ("portalized"?) after being upset as a 5-seed in the first round by James Madison. The Badgers watched Chucky Hepburn (Louisville), AJ Storr (Kansas) and Connor Essegian (Nebraska) walk away, dropping their ceiling in the process. This is a program that's held a lot of stability in roster retention — doing so against the currents of the sport — but this year was different. At least Steven Crowl, Max Klesmit and John Blackwell stuck around. (Tyler Wahl graduated, alas.) There can be good portal news, though: John Tonje was a non-factor at Mizzou last year because of injury, but it wouldn't stun me at all if he was a double-double guy in his final college season. Greg Gard has a big task ahead in what seems fated to have Wisconsin floating in the middle of a boggy Big Ten. One of about five teams in the ACC that I think has the capacity to finish as high as seventh and as low as 15th. It's just so tough to tell in this first year of overwrought high-major expansion. The Orange bring back JJ Starling, who's a lot of fun and should be in striking distance of averaging 17 points. Eddie Lampkin (previously of TCU and Colorado renown) will pay rent on the low block for his final year of eligibility. Junior wing Chris Bell (41.7% from 3-point land) is underrated and may unlock this team's ceiling. Hofstra transfer Jaquan Carlos is also getting some buzz in the preseason, so we're on the lookout for him. I like the Orange to finish top 10 in the ACC, but it could be a bumpy route to the finish. Consider how Red Autry won 20 games in his debut season. SU should be in that range again. This is a respectable jump from last season's Mississippi debut for Chris Beard, which included 20 wins (good) but also had the Rebels finish 79th at Torvik and 86th at KenPom (not good). The Rebels return PG Jaylen Murray and combo guard Matthew Murrell, in addition to 6-8 wing Jaemyn Brakefield. The defense was barely adequate at times, and now Jamarion Sharp, Moussa Cisse and Allen Flanigan have moved on. Can the group be collectively better? How will the scheme change? There's a lot to prove in the frontcourt. I've got some reservations over Beard getting this new roster (which includes four senior transfers, led by Sean Pedulla and Dre Davis) to be good enough on defense to make the NCAA Tournament. But the scoring capability will likely lead to some barn-burning atmospheres every month. Someone's going to surprise in the Big 12. Why not the Knights? Johnny Dawkins' team had three eyebrow-raising wins last season (Kansas, at Texas and at TCU), which has me thinking this program could be in for more party spoiling. Because UCF isn't appointment TV, it has one of the most unheralded (but reliable) duos in high-major ball. Watch out for guards Jaylin Sellers and Darius Johnson. They combined to average 31 points last season and could hit the 35 mark this season. The strange thing here is there's a bunch of guys on this roster who back stories that are longer than novellas (Mikey Williams, Dior Johnson, Benny Williams), but if the chemistry is in line, UCF will have top-half-of-the-league talent in the Big 12. And should the defense again rate top-30, like last year, then this outlook won't be bullish. Wolf Pack fans found me with a quickness a year ago when I stupidly neglected to include Nevada in my top 101. (Steve Alford's team was soundly in the top 60 of all metrics at year's end.) No such mistake this year. This is easily a top-70 roster. Alford is running it back with his three best at the 3, 4 and 5: Tre Coleman, Nick Davidson and KJ Hymes. Not many teams are able to claim the same. Look for Nevada to be in the thick of the NCAA convo because of its size and know-how. The backcourt of Tyler Rolison (big-time role increase) and Kobe Sanders (Cal Poly transfer) might take a little time to jell, but so long as they're counterplaying off the gravity from the aforementioned frontcourt, Rolison and Sanders are going to have a lot of chances to capitalize with the spacing provided in Alford's system. If not for super-senior guard Max Shulga, the Rams would be about two dozen spots further down on this list. Shulga, who has spent his career with coach Ryan Odom, had a few weeks over the spring where he opted for a future at Villanova. But after careful consideration, he doubled back to Richmond and will be the focal point on one of the best teams in the A-10. Putting it plainly: VCU has valid NCAA hopes because Shulga's here. As a career 40% 3-point shooter, his leadership by example will be vital. Remember, the Rams went 24-14 last season and would have made the NCAA Tournament had they not stubbed their toe in the conference title game against Duquesne. Odom brings back three starters (Shulga, Joe Bamisile, Zeb Jackson) who also led the team in scoring, giving this group a realistic chance not just at winning the A-10, but at making up ground in the nonconference, where games and scheduling never come easy for VCU. I count no more than three programs, max, that will have to overcome the loss of a player the way Northwestern will with Boo Buie, who graduated as NU's all-time leading scorer. That aside, times are pretty sweet now in Evanston, Illinois. Chris Collins guided the team to a second straight NCAA Tournament bid, which was previously considered a fantasy for a school with just three of those in its history. NU will drag some higher-end Big Ten teams into escape room-type scenarios at Welsh-Ryan Arena, where it's had a handful of loud upset wins over ranked opponents in recent seasons. Key names back: Brooks Barnhizer, Ty Berry, Nick Martinelli. Barnhizer is quite the well-rounded player, especially when you consider how much time he spends on the floor (more than 90% of minutes last season) without having noticeable efficiency drop-offs. Chris Jans is the only coach in Bulldogs history to make the NCAAs in his first two seasons. (He's the only coach to reach the Big Dance in Year 1, too.) It's been a really good fit from the get-go in Starkville. The Bulldogs do have quite the makeover, bringing aboard six transfers and two freshmen. The best player back is one of the best sophomores in college basketball. Josh Hubbard averaged 17.1 points as a 5-9 combo guard in a defense-leaning scheme. Can't wait to see how he follows up a delectable debut season. Hubbard is the guy on offense, while Cameron Matthews is the platonic ideal of a switchable 6-7 defender. MSU figures to rank top-30 in defensive efficiency behind the captaincy of Matthews, who will be in the mix for SEC Defensive Player of the Year. I presume I'll be lower on the Bulldogs than other preseason rankings. It's not about Jans. Instead, it's more due to the very likely scenario the SEC is a top-two league, in addition to my wait-and-see approach on the portal compilation in Starkville, which needs to prove its offensive capacity. Most everyone (yep, yours truly included) was wrong a year ago when BYU was projected in the bottom half of the Big 12, only to see Mark Pope win 23 games and finish in the top 20 in advanced-metrics rankings. Now Pope is at Kentucky and Kevin Young — a longtime NBA assistant, most recently with the Suns — has made the pivot to the college game. This will be one fascinating experiment, as Young is going to try to NBA-ify the Cougs while also adhering to certain structure and schemes fitted for college. Fortunately for Young, he was able to retain Dallin Hall, Trevin Knell, Fousseyni Traore and Richie Saunders, all of whom could have left but chose to keep on with BYU's unique culture. It's likely to be bumpy in Year 1, but the vision is to fund BYU and turn it into one of the top four programs in the Big 12 by the end of the decade. (Case in point: The Cougars are a major player for the top prospect in the country, AJ Dybantsa.) Young might pull a Pope and wildly overshoot expectations again, but I'll give the Coogs plenty of slack in his first season. What the Wolfpack did in March/April amounted to the most statistically improbable Final Four run ever. From trailing putrid Louisville in the first half of the first game of the ACC tourney to winning nine straight (which had never been done before) and making history in reaching the Final Four. Will there be a hangover in Raleigh? DJ Burns, Casey Morsell and DJ Horne won't be there to experience it. Kevin Keatts returns Jayden Taylor, Michael O'Connell and Ben Middlebrooks. Louisville transfer Brandon Huntley-Hatfield will step in and play the 4 and/or the 5 and probably be ecstatic to be in new surroundings. Last season's team found a way to scout effectively, capitalize on mismatches (a lot of this was Burns) and never take stretches off in games. It will need to do this to maximum effect in order to get back to the NCAAs. Ohio is blessed to bring back six of its top eight players from last season. Senior guard Shereef Mitchell is the latest sturdy captain in the backcourt. Combo forward AJ Clayton is one of the best 3-point-shooting frontcourt players at his level. He hit 40.1% of his triples a season ago. It's the MAC, so the league tournament is far from fair to the top seed, but it's probably rational to expect one of Akron, Ohio or Toledo to wind up winning the conference. With Akron losing too much firepower from a 24-win team and Toledo rebuilding half its roster, Jeff Boals' Bobcats are my pick to emerge as the top squad in a quintessential mid-major league. The Shockers were merely 15-19 a season ago, but it was Paul Mills' first season on the job after doing a wonderful six-year stay with Oral Roberts. Mills brings back five of his top seven minutes-getters, which should convey an above-.500 season. Wichita State figures to get consistent scoring from guards Xavier Bell and Harlond Beverly, who lead a group that's old-old. A lot of teams in this sport are veteran-capped, given this is the final year of the COVID bonus year, but Wichita State's projected starting five will rank near the top in experience. All five are fourth- and fifth-year players, and Mills will have three more battle-scarred seniors readily available off the bench. Projecting WSU as a top-75 team is a dart in the dark, but the program has the players and figures to have the coaching. Beyond that, the American Athletic Conference on average is able to put four teams into the top 75. Let's give 'em a shot. The Red Wolves should supplant James Madison as the premier team in the Sun Belt. Arkansas State was so feared that Memphis and Alabama were the only two schools from high-major and/or multi-bid leagues this past offseason that agreed to play Bryan Hodgson's team. Hodgson, a second-year coach, has done an outstanding job after spending eight years learning under Nate Oats. Three starters return from the program's second 20-win season since 1998. (A young Grant McCasland was responsible for the other one in 2017.) Taryn Todd and Derrian Ford are the notable guys back, but the spark plug should be Louisiana transfer Kobe Julien, who averaged 17+ last season. Craig Smith has gone from 11 wins to 17 to 22 in his first three years in Salt Lake City. The task to get even more in Year 4 will be immense. The Utes lost Branden Carlson to graduation and Deivon Smith to St. John's, which is going to be a big hit, as those were two of the 10 best players in the Pac-12 last season. Now Utah's in the Big 12. It returns Gabe Madsen, the only player back who was a double-digit scorer last season (13.2 ppg). Lawson Lovering and Hunter Erickson are also key returnees. Stretchy San Francisco guard Mike Sharavjamts is poised to be a difference-maker, and Baylor transfer Miro Little should also be featured in the starting lineup. The Pirates narrowly missed last year's NCAAs (then won the NIT) and, even worse, lost Kadary Richmond to Big East rival St. John's. Shaheen Holloway won 17 games in Year 1 and 25 last season. I think he splits that in '24-25 and ends up with either 20 or 21 Ws. Dylan Addae-Wusu and Isaiah Coleman return; expect both to become double-digit scorers after combining to average 14 points last season. Holloway brought on seven transfers, the most notable being an intra-league Big East swap of his own in Garwey Dual (Providence). The implied lack of 3-point prowess is striking. Without enough long-distance threats, it is hard to get the Hall higher on the list than this. That said, while it's casual to underestimate this team, keep in mind Holloway's one of the best do-more-with-less coaches in the high-major ranks. Few folks in the media were as consistently pro-Isaiah Stevens over the past two years as your humble author here. Stevens stuck around in Fort Collins when he easily could have left in 2022 or 2023 and sought bigger NIL paydays. He guided CSU as a point guard with few peers (if any) at his level. Now that his college career is done, the Rams have to hope Northern Iowa transfer Bowen Born can facilitate and guide the ship. It won't be easy, but at least Nique Clifford (a multi-tool 6-5 wing) is back. Clifford figures to be a first team-type of All-Mountain West player. He averaged 12.2 points and that number is a stone-cold lock to inflate. Clifford was a down-transfer from Colorado who is a primo example of how moving to a lower level can vastly improve a player's college experience. Niko Medved also brings back Jalen Lake in a starting role. Probably won't compete for the Mountain West title but should be good enough to flirt with the bubble. I was on hand in Manhattan in March for the Tigers' stunning 90-81 loss in the Ivy League Tournament semifinals to Brown. (Princeton trailed by as many as 22 in that game.) Coach Mitch Henderson was visibly and understandably furious in the aftermath. That aggravation should serve as a motivator, not an inhibitor, for the Tigers in what should be another very good year in Princeton. Last season's team was 24-3 before losing its final two games. Crucially, it returns shooting guard Xaivian Lee, who is the most talented player in the Ivy. But he wasn't the 2024 Ivy POY. That would be Caden Pierce, who is also still wearing black and orange. Those two give the Tigers dependability, leadership and star power. If Henderson enables it, Pierce and Lee could rank among the highest-scoring duos in the country. Both are capable of averaging 20 if they want it. Russell Turner has built up one of the strongest mid-major résumés in the game. With a 289-180 record in 14 seasons, he's finished half of his campaigns with the best team in the Big West. That should be the case again in 2024-25 because the Anteaters have four starters sticking around from a 24-win team that finished 82nd at KenPom. It would come as no shock if this team wound up having a top-50 defense, too. UCI has won on the strength of its bigs in the past, but this group figures to carve its way to another 20-win year based on the depth of its guards. The two starters who should pace this group are Justin Hohn and Andre Henry — a duo that should wind up being the best 3-point shooting backcourt in the Big West. Few coaches have ever had bigger jumps in success in their first three years of Division I coaching than Josh Schertz. His first season at Indiana State was 11-20. Then he went 23-13 in 2022-23. Last season ISU made the NIT title game and went 32-7. If not for an unprecedented amount of bid thieves, the Sycamores would have been in the NCAAs. And Schertz might be coaching at Louisville if they had danced. Instead, Saint Louis is the spot, and it feels right. This is a good jump and the type of hire that SLU fans can eagerly embrace. They've got a shot to once again have a relevant program in short order. A big reason is because Schertz brought MVC Player of the Year Robbie Avila with him. The lovable baller with too many great nicknames (Cream Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Nerd, Steph Blurry) instantly becomes the must-watch player in the A-10. Isaiah Swope (who sank 114 treys a season ago) also made the move down from Indiana State to be a Billiken. Schertz's avant-garde offense combined with some shrewd roster-building provides instant credibility. Eric Musselman won 24 games in his first season at Nevada (2015-16) and 20 in his first at Arkansas (2019-20). Neither team made the NCAAs, and it seems more likely than not that will be true of the Trojans in their first year under Muss and in the West Coast-ified Big Ten. A double-digit transfer load comes aboard, many of them one-year guys in a grad-school year. Led most likely by Desmond Claude (Xavier), it's unclear just how well this group of ballers from Boise State, UMass, UC San Diego, Michigan, Northern Colorado and beyond will jell. Muss is right at home in SoCal, and if it hits, this has a shot to be the one job he sticks at for the better part of a decade. But it's hard to see this assembly as a top-half Big Ten outfit. After regularly rating in the top 100 when Phil Martelli was there, SJU finally broke back into that echelon again by finishing 99th at KenPom last season, Billy Lange's fifth tour. I think the Hawks can be similarly good, if not even slightly better, due to all-Atlantic 10 guard Erik Reynolds II playing one final season on the hill. Reynolds' 17.3 points per game led the league, and teaming up alongside returnee Xzayvier Brown (12.7 ppg) will give the Hawks one of the best backcourt tandems in the A-10. Brown is a stud and could compete with Reynolds for A-10 POY honors. Rasheer Fleming is also back, giving SJU three starting players who stuck around and averaged double digits. That's a luxury few non-high-major programs can claim in 2024. It's a reboot in Fort Worth for Jamie Dixon. The Horned Frogs figure to start four transfers alongside returning center Ernest Udeh Jr. Dixon will also have seven players on the roster yet to play a college game. That's going to lead to piles of losses in the Big 12. Unavoidable. I like the addition of Arizona State transfer Frankie Collins, who will be the head of the snake. He'll be flanked by Noah Reynolds (via Green Bay) and Brendan Wenzel (via Wyoming). TCU is coming off its third straight NCAA appearance, which had never happened in program history. A step or two back in '24-25 is almost certainly coming, but that's no indictment on Dixon's track record. Ben Jacobson has been ping-ponging between good and bad seasons for almost a decade. Here's UNI's win totals, starting in 2016 and up through last season: 23, 14, 16, 16, 25, 10, 20, 14, 19. The Panthers haven't won at least 19 games in back-to-back seasons since their two most recent NCAA Tournament showings in 2015/16. While Bradley is clearly the preseason No. 1 in the MVC, Northern Iowa is a fair pick to finish second — and have its best two-year push since 2016. Well-rounded power wing Tytan Anderson and 6-4 point guard Trey Campbell will guide the way in Cedar Falls. A bizarrely god-awful season (from 25-10 in Dennis Gates' first year to 8-24 last season, including going 0-19 in the SEC) meant Mizzou was one of the most shocking bad teams in the country. There are reasons for belief in a healthy turnaround, though. The Tigers figure to play seven guys in the primary rotation who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players. Wing Tamar Bates (13.5 ppg) returns alongside Caleb Grill, who only played nine games due to injury but should become a double-digit scorer. Duke transfer power forward Mark Mitchell was a crucial portal pickup, as was Iowa's Tony Perkins on the wing. The Tigers will be better built to withstand the rigors of the SEC banked on a vastly improved defense. Gates is too good of a coach to have a terrible team in back-to-back seasons. Fran McCaffery has a good shot at coaching another First Team All-Big Ten player. Payton Sandfort is coming into his fourth season of college ball, having averaged 16.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and shot 37.9% from beyond the arc last season. He's going to be Iowa's No. 1 (and likely No. 2) option on offense as the Hawkeyes look to finish top-20 in offensive efficiency (per KenPom) for an eighth straight season. The defensive concerns are again heavy, which is why I'm predicting a subpar campaign in Iowa City, but if you like the Hawkeyes you should feel great. I don't think there's a team I'm more often wrong about heading into a season than Iowa. Louisville fans aren't looking for a lulu of a season, but they do think Pat Kelsey recruited a roster good enough to go from 12 total wins in two years under Kenny Payne to an NCAA bid in Year 1 of Kelsey. We shall see. As I said on the Eye on College Basketball Podcast last week, Louisville is among the toughest teams to peg in the ACC. Just an outright rebuild emerging from an awful situation. Working in Kelsey's favor: His only season below .500 was his first as a head coach in 2012-13 at Winthrop (14-17). The Cards bring on Chucky Hepburn from Wisconsin, Terrence Edwards Jr. from JMU — who was REALLY good — plus Noah Waterman via BYU, a few guys from Charleston and Kasean Pryor from South Florida. I want to see how the pieces coagulate and I want to see if Kelsey can and does play as up-tempo with U of L as he did with Winthrop and Charleston. James Jones needs four more wins to hit 400 for his career, which should culminate before we get to December. Jones is one of the longest-tenured coaches in Division I; this is his 26th season with the Bulldogs. (It's to Yale's benefit, but this guy should have been hired to a bigger job three-to-eight years ago, frankly.) With Jones still operating in his prime, Yale can be a top-100 team for the fifth time in seven seasons. With Princeton the practical pick to win the Ivy, Yale is the evident No. 2 — and may well win the league's automatic bid again in the intimate and pressurized confines of that league bracket. The Elis lost Danny Wolf to Michigan, otherwise they'd be my preseason pick. Bez Mbeng and John Poulakidas (who had 28 vs. Auburn in the tournament) are back to ball in New Haven, Connecticut. After three consecutive 20-win seasons for a program that's produced a couple of top-20 NBA picks (Jalen Williams, Brandin Podziemski) as of late, let's toss them into the 100 And 1. Herb Sendek has a really good staff and didn't lose anyone to the portal (less than 10 teams did in all of college hoops) and should have nine guys playing double-digit minutes, which is why I've got the Broncos positioned to finish in the top four of the WCC. You best believe that Adama-Alpha Bal (a top-10 name in the sport) is ready for his senior year close-up. He'll team up with Johnny O'Neil, who is a jack-of-all-trades type … at 6-10. The top four of the WCC looks good again. It's a shame that the league is losing Gonzaga in two years, but that will help programs like Santa Clara break through after the breakup. Alan Huss had one of the best debut coaching seasons Division I has seen — regardless of conference designation — in recent memory. He took over the Panthers last season and transformed a school that averaged 13 wins over the previous seven seasons into a 27-9 inaugural campaign. Unfortunately for High Point, it got picked off in the Big South Tournament against Longwood, losing a heartbreaker by one in OT. Now Huss gets four starters back, including potential Big South POY Kezza Giffa and second-year defensive standout Juslin Bodo Bodo. The Gamecocks lost three of their top four scorers, who accounted for nearly 38 points per game, but do bring back one of the best sophomores in the country. Collin Murray-Boyles may sound like the name of the second-best striker for Ireland's World Cup team, but no. He's a 6-7 forward who has a great opportunity to step into the spotlight and be one of the five best players in the SEC. The lack of proven pieces around Murray-Boyles has me hesitant overall on the Gamecocks, who were one of the surprises of 2023-24 after winning 26 games and earning a No. 6 seed despite being picked dead last in the then-14-team SEC. The Hokies — and a few teams like them — will be interesting test cases for predictive metrics in this new phase of 16- and 18-team megaconferences. If a team like this goes 18-16 and finishes four games below .500 in league play, will it still work its way into the top 75? Glancing at VT's roster, you can make a case for not including this team in the top 101. But I will because Mike Young's a really good coach and should squeeze a lot out of his roster. Young is 92-66 in five seasons in Blacksburg, holding a 50-52 mark against ACC opponents. Virginia Tech brings aboard Charleston's Ben Burnham and Temple's Hysier Miller as its biggest stat guys in the portal. The attrition is huge; no ACC team that didn't undergo a coaching change lost a bigger dose of its roster than the Hokies. This one's admittedly a hunch based on little evidence. But guess what? Teams make huge jumps from well outside the top 100 every year. It's part of the fun of watching the season unfold. We've got two years until the Pac-12 revives. During its interregnum, Oregon State (and Washington State) are taking up residency in the WCC. I think the move will do wonders for Wayne Tinkle's program. Plus, the Beavers are loaded with guys between 6-7 and 7 feet. As Dan Patrick once said: Welcome to the Big Show. Can't wait to see how this roster-building approach fares in a mid-major league. The WCC schedule is now 18 games, with a home-and-home against Gonzaga guaranteed. Get this: Oregon State is 25-2 vs. Gonzaga, and 11-0 since Gonzaga went Division I in the early 1960s. The teams last met in 1991! Putting faith in a remarkable second-year spike for Georgetown under Ed Cooley. No. 90 doesn't get you anywhere near the NCAA tourney convo obviously, but I'll take a flier on Georgetown hitting 15 wins, upgrading its defense and beating at least three non-DePaul teams in the Big East. Malik Mack could be the star. The Harvard transfer is likely to be a high-volume producer alongside junior guard Jayden Epps. The addition of TCU forward Micah Peavy should provide G'town a necessary older-guy presence on a team that's got a lot of freshmen. What a story. Bucky McMillan, who grew up four miles from Samford and has lived his whole life in Birmingham, Alabama, took his BuckyBall style to its maximum potential (seemingly) by going from six wins in Year 1 to 29 and an NCAA Tournament berth in Year 4. Samford was 81st at KenPom last season after falling to Kansas in controversial fashion in the first round of the Big Dance. McMillan lost four starters, but I'd bank on this team being able to average north of 77 or 78 points (last year: 81.4) because of the style of play. Rylan Jones is the lone returning starter on a team that's projected to be the best in the SoCon. A lot of players are going to have an increase in minutes and impact. McMillan's press-for-40-minutes-no-matter-what blueprint is the only one of its kind in college basketball. Here are the teams outside the high-major leagues with the most wins over the last eight seasons: Gonzaga (121), Belmont (120) and Vermont (115). John Becker has made the NCAAs six times; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Related: UVM has ranked top-100 at KenPom six times in Becker's tenure; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Becker should be taking calls from dozens of coaches across the country so they can learn his secret for avoiding invariable pitfalls that affect most other mid-majors. Four starters are back from a No. 13 seed that went 28-7. Shamir Bogues seems to be the next big name in the Green Mountain State, but beyond individual play, Becker believes this team could be one of his best on defense. The Tigers have a chance to be the surprise mid-major team in the sport. Pat Skerry's team lost just two hoopers from last year's lineup that won 20 games (and they were to graduation and a down-transfer to D-II). In total, 10 out of 11 possible returnees are back. Understand: This kind of retention scenario will present itself maybe two or three times at the non-military mid-major level moving forward. A really good story is brewing here. Four players returned who averaged double figures, led by Christian May and Dylan Williamson. In total, 81% of the team's scoring returns and Skerry probably will go 10-deep well into league play. To me, the narrow favorites over Charleston in a competitive top end of the CAA. I dithered between FAU or UNT as the last team from the American in the back of the Top 100 And 1. I'll lean Mean Green due to not having a coaching change and the program ranking top-90 in multiple metrics four years running. Due to losing four starters, the Mean Green probably take a step back, but Ross Hodge's defensive scheme is going to ensure this team is second tier at worst in the AAC. Hodge is a top-10 (maybe top-five) defensive coach in the country. But without a threatening scorer, things get problematic. I think the name to watch is Atin Wright, a transfer from Drake who can shoot from deep and is going to be North Texas' spreader on offense. It's easy to overlook a team that wins by committee the way UNT has in recent years, but until I see results that justify putting this program outside the top 101, I won't do it. The Nittany Lions have five seniors back. Ace Baldwin is probably going to destroy opposing guards' spirits with almost every assignment he gets. That guy is worth the price of admission. No, PSU doesn't have great basketball history, but Mike Rhoades' track record (389-206 in his career, including a decade in D-III) suggests this team is being underrated heading into the season. Again, the Big Ten is such a foggy set of circumstances, but something tells me Rhoades' team will play spoiler on multiple nights this season. Over the past 20 years, with only a few exceptions, the MVC has placed at least three teams in the top 100 of a variety of metrics by season's end. I think 2025 will sustain the pattern. I've got Bradley in the top 50, Northern Iowa 16 spots north of this, and now we welcome the Murray State Racers back into the top-100 club. The team is one of my picks for one of the biggest turnarounds in the sport. Steve Prohm's program won only 12 games last season. So, why so much faith? Eight juniors and seniors will take up the entirety of the rotation, with a reasonable expectation that this will be a top-two defense in the Valley. At the 1 is JaCobi Wood, who won't exactly be Ja Morant, but I think he's poised to be one of only a handful of guys in D-I to average 15/5/5. If it all comes together, he could do that and creep up on 40% shooting from 3-point range. It would be easy to dismiss OSU after a lackluster run at the end of Mike Boynton's tenure, a subsequent coaching hire and inevitable massive roster flip. But the new coach is Steve Lutz, who has made the past three NCAA tourneys while at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Western Kentucky. He's a really good coach and previously worked under Matt Painter at Purdue and Greg McDermott at Creighton. Most importantly, Lutz wound up recruiting one of the oldest rosters in high-major ball, which I expect to translate to a solid Year 1. The familiar name is Bryce Thompson, who opted to stick it out in Stillwater after Boynton's departure. The new name is Devo Davis, who can be hit-or-miss but needs to hit big to give the Cowboys a spoiler's chance in the 16-team Big 12. The Buffaloes are losing a lot. The most talented team in program history, essentially. Gone: Tristan da Silva, KJ Simpson, Cody Williams, all NBA picks, two of them first rounders. And Eddie Lampkin Jr. is gone as well. Tad Boyle's had some really good years with lowered expectations. Let's see if he can pull off another one here, because it looks to be a tough slog ahead as Colorado transitions into the Big 12. It's anyone's guess as to who steps up in a starring role, but the candidates are Washington State transfer Andrej Jakimovski and top returning reserve Julian Hammond III. On a side note, I'm not sure there's a greater personality disparity in coaches at the high-major level than Deion Sanders and Tad Boyle. Frank Martin won 15 games in Year 1, 20 last season, so why not sign up for the Minutemen to be near the top of the A-10? It's an ambitious forecast, but Martin's force of will tends to have his rosters outperform expectations. Simply put, there will be 10-15 teams that easily rank top-100 come March but that can't be found inside the preseason top 100 at any predictive metrics site today. I'll go with UMass as one of those teams. Shooting guard Rahsool Diggins is back; expect him to drop 15 points per night. Sophomore point guard Jaylen Curry should shine. This is UMass' final season in the A-10, by the way. The school idiotically voted to leave and chase ill-fated football dreams in the MAC starting in 2025, a decision that's alienated a heavy portion of the school's alumni base. It's fair to say Bobby Hurley is in a hot-seat season, due to the new-look Big 12 and the fact ASU has finished sub-.500 in three of the past four years. If 2025 doesn't include an NCAA bid, change could be in the offing. And so, in comes the highest-rated frosh class of Hurley's career. One of the surprise roster additions of the offseason was ASU landing five-star Jayden Quaintance, who could help prove this ranking too dismissive. Best of all, due to his age, he's not eligible to be drafted until 2026. It's not just Quaintance; ASU also got a football-style flip in Joson Sanon, who balked on his commitment to Arizona and took to Tempe. I've got the Sun Devils low, however, because relying on freshmen and portal adds from the mid-major ranks (Missouri State's Alston Mason and Milwaukee's BJ Freeman are expected to be prominently featured) could be a challenging playbook in the best league in the country. The Cornhuskers are coming off only their second NCAA Tournament bid since 1998. This was a sweet story last season, but the bounce-back could be difficult. Keisei Tominaga's off conquering the world these days; the sport will miss him so. Critically, Rienk Mast is out for the season because of a knee injury. That lowers NU's ceiling due to Mast's vastly underrated skillset. Look for returnees Brice Williams and Juwan Gary to be high-leverage, positionless-type players, though maximizing their success could be attached to Utah transfer point guard Rollie Worster, who missed much of last season to injury. So there's your widespread preview. Want more hoops previews? We've got a lot in stock already. To start, head here for our preseason All-America teams and our preseason awards. If you want even more detailed previews of the high-major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12 and the SEC) and a best-of-the-rest lookahead outside the power leagues. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The hope. The anticipation. Sneakers squeaking. Basketballs bouncing. Whistles chirping. Coaches already in full-throat before the season is in full throe. Find a quiet spot and, if you really try hard enough, you'll hear college basketball building for its long-awaited return in the first week of November. College hoops season is less than three weeks away, but more than 360 teams across the United States have been ramping and tuning up for weeks. We're all just about ready to tip this thing off — and angst grows as we lurch toward Nov. 4. Once the games begin, we can only hope the phantasmagoric will arrive as scheduled — but without a hint of its imminent entry, for maximum impact — as this beautiful mess of a sport is sure to take us on another great journey of joy, shock and madness. Ah, we know it will. We just don't know the when, who, how or why. That's why we love this sport so much. Before we get another college basketball campaign going, let's zoom out and lock in. As has been the case for a decade now, I've foolishly and enthusiastically taken to a master preseason ranking of teams. My methods are uncomplicated but diligent: examine the rosters, check in with coaches for intel, evaluate programs based on recent success (or a lack of it), factor in (and try to discern) inevitable surges and fades, and mostly avoid preseason metrics as to not be influenced by the (often accurate) biases of algorithms. Oh, and: Be sure to just let a few inexplicable predictions rip and hope for the best. A note on this year's process. With the Big Ten and ACC now 18 teams, plus the Big 12 and SEC beefing up to 16 apiece, I found myself wrestling a bit with how to place power-conference teams from about the No. 60 spot and below. Will we see the 79 teams from the power conferences (Big East has 11 and is also in that class) all mostly wind up as top-100 teams in most ratings systems by season's end? Will most of the 79 work their way into the top 70? Is the deck going to prove to be stacked that much in their favor? Or will a dozen-or-so mid-majors break through and find themselves ranked in the top 60? I think that's still possible, and my predictions reflect that, but if it skews toward the big boys in massive ways, I'll take that into consideration a year from now. I want to see how this new world of mass high-major expansion impacts the universe of college hoops, however that winds up playing out. Once more unto the breach, away we go! In what feels like a wide-open season just over the horizon, I'm taking a team at No. 1 with the preseason national player of the year; a team that brought in one of the best transfer classes of the offseason; a team that is adding multiple five-star freshman; and a team that had the No. 2-ranked offense last season en route to the Final Four. Alabama. The Tide are in the rare spot of having the men's basketball band ranked higher in the preseason than the football fellas, just the eighth time that's happened and the first time since 2006. (Bama football was No. 5 in the preseason.) Alabama, of course, is coming off its first Final Four in school history. Now it's going to try to become just the fourth SEC school (joining Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky) to make back-to-back Final Fours. Remember, the Tide was wicked unpredictable on defense last season, but survived in the NCAAs despite that, beating trendy Charleston and 30-win Grand Canyon before upsetting No. 1 UNC and then pushing past Clemson in the Elite Eight. Ultimately, Alabama lost by 14 to UConn in the national semis, which was the Huskies' smallest margin of victory in the NCAAs. Nate Oats did this after losing his entire staff the previous offseason, in addition to the Brandon Miller debacle. Now he's got one of the strongest rosters in the sport, led by CBS Sports Preseason Player of the Year Mark Sears. The inventive lead guard averaged 21.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists. Returning with Sears are two more fifth-year guys: Grant Nelson (11.9 ppg) and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (8.9 ppg), in addition to promising 6-11 sophomore Jarin Stevenson. Oats picked up notable transfers Chris Youngblood (15.3 ppg at South Florida), Houston Mallette (14.7 ppg at Pepperdine), Clifford Omoruyi (10.4 ppg at Rutgers) and a quisling in former Auburn guard Aden Holloway (7.3 ppg). Oh, and there's also two five-star freshmen in play: power forward Derrion Reid and center Aiden Sherrell. Bama has a loaded nonconference schedule (it plays Purdue, UNC and Houston, all top seeds last March, plus Illinois, Rutgers and Creighton, in addition to hosting a lot of really good mid-majors; it only has six non-con home games, the lowest of any high-major team in the country), so there's a chance the Tide accrues some losses that affect their standing in the human rankings. But I'm expecting this team to be a No. 1 seed and a clear title contender from Game 1. If Sears plays to expectations and the offense remains elite, this will be the best Alabama team in school history. A program that has finished No. 2 at KenPom.com three years running, so let's slot it right there again. Houston's averaged a nation-leading 30.2 wins the past six seasons, amassing 13 NCAA Tournament victories in that span. It hasn't lost more than five league games in a season in that span, including postseason play. The Cougars moved from the American to the Big 12 last season, and not only was there no drop-off whatsoever, the team seemed emboldened by its conference upgrade. A year ago, UH lost a First Team All-American (Marcus Sasser), only to produce another: Jamal Shead. Now Shead is gone (and had he not ripped up his ankle against Duke in the NCAAs, it's all too conceivable Houston would've been at the Final Four in place of NC State). The Cougars' next player in line for All-American status is senior L.J. Cryer, who averaged 15.5 points last season and should show his best yet. The Coogs also bring back proven players Emanuel Sharp (12.6 ppg), J'Wan Roberts (9.5 ppg), Ja'Vier Francis (6.0 ppg) and Joseph Tugler — a key defensive presence whose season ended in February. There's also Terrance Arceneaux, also coming back from injury and whose time surely must be coming. Milos Uzan, via Oklahoma, will be productive in a supporting role that won't require him to be an alpha. Kelvin Sampson's a proven commodity in college hoops. The Big 12 might be the best conference in the sport again, and while Kansas is rightfully getting a lot of No. 1 buzz heading into the season, I'll slightly side in that league with the program whose defense has been more reliable in the past half-decade than any other in college basketball. We're going to see a lot of good three-man cores this season, but Kansas could have the best in the sport: Hunter Dickinson, KJ Adams Jr. and Dajuan Harris Jr. They're all back and each does a variety of things different from the other two that will, again, make Kansas a national title threat. KU was supposed to be that a season ago, but the Jayhawks faced injury issues and withered down the stretch, finishing 27th at KenPom, its all-time low-water mark in that metric's 28-year database. The Jayhawks have reinforcements coming in, and the outlook is optimistic because AJ Storr (Wisconsin), Rylan Griffen (Alabama) and Zeke Mayo (South Dakota State) are all proven scorers AND shooters. Griffen could be near the top of the list of best 3-point snipers if his trajectory translates. KU also has top-20 prospect Flory Bidunga, a center, and four-star guard Rakease Passmore coming in. No Elmarko Jackson, though; he's out for the season with patellar tendon injury he suffered in June. The Jayhawks' biggest problem last season was depth. At one point, Self told me, he seriously debated whether or not to play his five best players together for about 36 out of 40 minutes in a game — and hockey-sub five bench players and try to survive that way. He never did it, but it would have been a fascinating approach. This team, knock on wood, will not need to be kept together with lattice. Dickinson is a preseason First Team All-American in this, his final season of college eligibility. Everything is in place for another great run in Lawrence. Most others in this scenario wouldn't sniff the top 10, solely because of the amount of unproven players that are going to step into new roles and more prominent tasks in Storrs. But UConn is different. Dan Hurley is even more different than different. I've got the Huskies at No. 4 because the program kept Hurley and won the angsty sweepstakes against the Lakers. The coaching staff is still entirely intact, too. And Alex Karaban, a two-time national champion as a starter on both teams, turned down the NBA for one more year in order to chase NCAA history. That's enough to give the Huskies the benefit of the doubt and place them this high heading into the season. Connecticut lost four starters (Tristen Newton, Donovan Clingan, Cam Spencer, Stephon Castle) who'll likely be replaced in the starting lineup by Hassan Diarra, Samson Johnson, Solo Ball and Liam McNeeley. The first three are returnees and McNeeley earned CBS Sports Freshman All-America honors. One guy who's probably going to earn a fair share of starts is Jaylin Stewart. Connecticut also picked up lead guard Aidan Mahaney from Saint Mary's. The two most recent back-to-back champions were Florida in 2007 and Duke in 1992. In the subsequent seasons, Florida went 24-12, made the NIT and was 8-9 vs. SEC opponents. It never reached No. 1 in the AP poll in 2007-08. The 1992-93 Duke team finished 24-8 and went 10-7 vs. ACC opponents. It lost to Cal in the second round of the NCAAs. The Devils spent five weeks at No. 1. Relatedly, we polled 100-plus coaches this summer and asked if they thought UConn would make a third straight Final Four: 68% said no. But the fact 32% said yes is incredible. Hurley is the face of college basketball and one of the most prominent coaches in American sports. He is operating at the peak of his powers, and knowing him, he's obsessed with proving people wrong and is probably sounding klaxons over being put fourth on this list. It will be absurdly difficult to win three national titles in a row. I can't wait to see this version of UConn and how the story plays out over the next five months. Another year, another loaded Duke roster? Yes, but this one includes the most hyped incoming prospect in a generation. Although Zion Williamson became a transcendent sensation, he wasn't expected to be a First Team All-American when he started at Duke; he wasn't even the highest-rated prospect on the team. (RJ Barrett AND Cam Reddish were both ranked above Williamson in 2018.) Now, Cooper Flagg, the CBS Sports Preseason Freshman of the Year, represents Duke's chance to recapture the nation's attention. He could be the best player in the sport … but he's also got a lot around him that may lead to a different reality. Flagg's certainly regarded as the top NBA Draft prospect heading into November. Fortunately, he'll have veterans to acclimate him, most notably junior point guard Tyrese Proctor, sophomore guard Caleb Foster and grad senior Mason Gillis, who comes by way of Purdue, bringing a lot of winning experience with him from West Lafayette, Indiana. Jon Scheyer enters Year 3. The pressure will be significant. He's done a really good job through the first two campaigns, but these next five-to-six months seem destined to feel a lot different. Expectations will be to win the ACC, then get a top-two seed in the NCAAs and to make the Final Four after coming one game short last spring. Proctor has to be more consistent. Flagg's fellow freshmen are all ranked top-30: Isaiah Evans, a lanky 6-foot-7 wing; Khaman Maluach, a 7-1 center from South Sudan who played in the Olympics; Kon Knueppel, a 6-5 shooting guard who might be the skeleton key for this offense; Pat Ngongba (currently dealing with a foot injury), a 6-10 power forward (the idea that he could be the eighth- or ninth-most important player on this team speaks to how loaded Duke is); and Darren Harris, a 6-4 shooting guard who most fan bases would be doing cartwheels over if he was on their roster. Scheyer also has Tulane transfer Sion James (14.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 38% from 3-point range), who will get a lot of run. Can Duke win big despite having so much youth, and how much youth will they rely on? The Blue Devils will be a national story every week, and whether you like, love or hate them, that's a good thing for college basketball. For the third straight year, I'm higher on the Bears than just about anyone you'll find. It's working out for me: BU has had a No. 1- or No. 3-seeded résumé the past five years (counting 2020 when that season ended). Scott Drew lost a LOT from last season, and he's also had some coaching turnover on his staff, but until I see true drop-off in Waco I'm not bailing on Baylor as a top-10 program. This year, I've slotted the Bears second in the Big 12 and easily in the Final-Four-contenders discussion. Drew will have to account for losing another lottery pick one-and-done guy (Ja'Kobe Walter) by ... bringing in another lottery pick one-and-done guy (VJ Edgecombe). There is a workable chance Edgecombe winds up leading all freshmen in scoring. He's receiving buzz already for how dynamic his game is. Real star potential. Whether he should or will be tasked with being Baylor's leader is another matter. Langston Love (11.0 ppg) and Jayden Nunn (10.5 ppg) are the two prominent guys back for the Bears. They'll play with Duke transfer Jeremy Roach in the backcourt. Roach has said he wants to be a pure point guard in this Baylor scheme. If that happens and he's an elite decision-maker, then Baylor will be a top-10 team. The Bears also got a crucial transfer in fifth-year player Norchad Omier, who flew up from Miami. Baylor's varying looks will be interesting. I expect a lot of small-ball with Omier at the 5, flanked by Edgecombe at the 4, Langston at 3, Nunn at the 2 and Roach playing the 1. If Omier plays power forward, then junior Josh Ojianwuna will step in at center. Robert Wright III and Jason Asemota are two more fresh bodies (and freshmen) who will see some time. Be patient with the Bears. No high-major team has a tougher first two games. They're playing Gonzaga in GU's backyard on opening night, then facing Arkansas in Dallas five days later. St. John's, UConn and Tennessee (potentially) are also on the schedule. Then it's Big 12 time. Similar to Alabama, this team could be better than its loss total indicates. Lose the best player in school history and stay a top-10 team? That's what great culture and elite coaching will do for you. That's what Purdue has. The only school to win more games over the past three years than Purdue is the one I have ranked at No. 2. The Big Ten — now a ridiculous, nobody-asked-for-this 18-school union — feels as hodgepodge as ever. But I'll take the Boilermakers to emerge at the top again. Three starters are back, the most important being Braden Smith, who could become a top-three point guard if this offense regenerates properly, Doctor Who-style, without Zach Edey. Purdue, in total, has 46% of its scoring back from last season's team that made it to the national championship. Look for Trey Kaufman-Renn to be THE breakout player in the Big Ten. In two seasons he's averaged 4.5 and 6.4 points. That number should double, minimally. Caleb Furst is also likely to bust from his shell. But this is Purdue, so let's talk centers. Who are the new towers in play? There's Daniel Jacobsen (7-4) and Will Berg (7-2). The Jesse Pinkman memes about Painter continually recruiting alien-sized players will continue apace once the games get going. Purdue has rostered a 7-footer 13 years in a row which, for all we know, is an all-time NCAA record. (If you know of a school that's had a 7-footer for 14 straight seasons, please find me.) Here's an intriguing note from Purdue: The team brings back 60% of its starting minutes from a season ago. Why does that matter? This is the 11th time under Painter that Purdue has brought back that much year-over-year. The eight most recent times Purdue brought back "at least 110 starts" from the year before, Purdue made the Sweet 16 in six of those seasons. Its winning percentage in those eight seasons: .789. That's really, really good. And given the growth of Smith and Fletcher Loyer, it should signal stability in the foggiest power conference in college basketball. Purdue has 113 league wins the past eight seasons. No high-major team claims more. Its Big Ten reign will continue by winning a fifth conference title in a nine-year span. The Volunteers had the second-best player in college basketball last season. Dalton Knecht will go down as one of the best up-transfers in college hoops history. From Northern Colorado to SEC POY. And Tennessee made a fun run to the Elite Eight before losing to the best player in college basketball. Rick Barnes not only lost Knecht, but also Jonas Aidoo, Josiah-Jordan James, Santiago Vescovi and Tobe Awaka. It's a lot! Maybe Tennessee suffers a plummet and proves to be, like, the eighth-best team in the SEC. But I'm gonna zag on that theory. I'll stick with the Barnes formula and register UT as the No. 2 team in the league. Critically, Zakai Zeigler's leadership at point guard is still in play in Knoxville. Zeigler can be a top-20 player nationally, buttressed by the fact that he's probably a top-10 defensive guard (at 5-8, no less). Zeigler's going to be at his best physically this season, and he'll pair in the backcourt with a North Florida transfer who hopes to be the next Knecht. His name is Chaz Lanier and he shot 44% from 3-point range last season while averaging 19.7 points. I like him to easily average double digits in the SEC. Barnes also brought on Felix Okpara from Ohio State, a quick-twitch center who could threaten to average three blocks and is a major reason why Tennessee will still be regarded as an SEC contender. I like sophomore J.P. Estrella to have a breakout season. Unclear whether he'll start in November, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he was hearing his name called in pregame by February. Due to the SEC's depth, accurately predicting even the 1-5 order of this league will be near-impossible. But until I see Tennessee significantly drop under Barnes, the Vols (as a regular-season operation) deserve the benefit of every doubt. Mark Few is feeling revitalized. He's coming off his time with Team USA at the Olympics, where he served as an assistant on the gold-medal winning team. It'd be no shock if Few picked up a few extra tricks from Steve Kerr and deployed some fun stuff in his offense in the months forthcoming. The Bulldogs are dinged slightly by the unfortunate loss — for the second year in a row — of small forward Steele Venters. The Eastern Washington transfer suffered an Achilles tear less than a year after rupturing an ACL. He figured to be a double-digit scorer. This being Gonzaga, I still think the Bulldogs find a way to have one of the best offenses in the sport for the ninth straight season. Graham Ike (16.5 ppg) will probably have the best season of his career; the timing is great considering this is his last one. Same goes for Ryan Nembhard, a fringe preseason All-America candidate who could threaten to average 15 points and 7 assists. Gonzaga has 81.4% of its minutes back from 2023-24, seventh-most in the country, according to BartTorvik.com. The only high-major program bringing back more is Notre Dame, per Torvik, and the only other two in the top 25 in terms of power-conference programs are Houston and Marquette. In bringing back more than 80% of the team's minutes, continuity should provide an easy transition and a likely 18th straight season with 25-plus wins. Guys like Nolan Hickman, Ben Gregg and Dusty Stromer should all play increased roles, while Pepperdine transfer Michael Ajayi (absolute hooper) and Arkansas import Khalif Battle (on his fourth school in four years, no less) reinforce GU's firepower and experience factor. The question is: Have we seen Gonzaga at its best, or does Few have another Final Four-level team in him? This one seems to have a shot. Fortunately, we don't have to wait to see the goods. The Zags play Baylor on opening night, thankfully giving college hoops a true marquee matchup to tip off the season. There's split opinion on how viable North Carolina is after losing one of the most productive players in school history, Armando Bacot, in addition to saying goodbye to double-digit scorers Harrison Ingram and Cormac Ryan. The most important player was RJ Davis, and lucky for UNC, the First Team All-American is using his COVID year for one last dance. Asking Davis (21.2 ppg) to recreate his impact from his senior season will be tough, but he might not have to in order to keep North Carolina in the top two in the ACC. Davis has company in the backcourt with familiar teammates Elliot Cadeau (expect a much better player this season), Seth Trimble and Jae'Lyn Withers coming back to Chapel Hill. Belmont transfer Cade Tyson (16.2 ppg) brings shooting reinforcements, while Vanderbilt big Ven-Allen Lubin is going to play with Jalen Washington to hopefully keep UNC's frontcourt somewhat respectable. UNC's lack of interior presence is the elephant in the room when we discuss the Heels' chances of being a national title contender. Ironically, I'm in on Carolina as a top-10 team because of its top two freshmen. It's counterintuitive in this final year of the bonus COVID year to think that 18-year-olds could be linchpin-type players, but that is setting up as the case here. Ian Jackson was ranked No. 8 in his class. The 6-5 2-guard from the Bronx could be a streaky shooter, but he's going to be a lot of fun as a potential sometimes-starter. Drake Powell (No. 11 in the class of 2024) is a guy I can't wait to watch. Powell's a strong wing, someone who could prove to be a high-level defender right away. It wouldn't surprise me if those two wound up being top-10 freshmen. UNC fell short of a second Final Four in three years under Hubert Davis, despite being a No. 1 seed, thanks to slamming into high-octane Alabama. Asking this group to build top-20 formats in offensive and defensive efficiency (which seems plausible as far as I'm concerned) should equate to Carolina again being in the Final Four mix. Things get going early: Nov. 8 at Kansas is a wonderful matchup in the first week of the season. Then UNC will test itself in Maui in that loaded field before eventually facing the likes of Alabama, Florida and UCLA in December. This team is going to take losses but will solidify itself to tussle with Duke atop the ACC. Let's just buy the ticket and take the ride. This is admittedly an aggressive spot for the Johnnies, who are coming off the shocking non-inclusion to the NCAAs. Not just that — St. John's wasn't even in the first four out after giving UConn its closest game in all of March and April. The Red Storm went 20-13 with a 4-10 record in Quad 1 and 3-1 in Quad 3. It wasn't enough. Now it needs to be better than an 11-9 team in the Big East that's sitting in fifth. I think it clears that bar with ease in '24-25. Rick Pitino is going to be a mad scientist making sure this team is nowhere near the bubble, despite the departures of Daniss Jenkins, Joel Soriano, Jordan Dingle, Chris Leldum and Nahiem Alleyne. They merely combined to average more than 57 points per game no biggie. My favorite conspiracy theory is Pitino went to Kentucky's Big Blue Madness and donned a UK sweater, whipping up multiple fan bases into a tizzy, knowing all the while he's got a team that's going to kill it this season. So, who's stepping up? RJ Luis (10.9 ppg) is the most important returnee, though I'd bank on Simeon Wilcher (2.8 ppg) quadrupling his scoring output in his sophomore season. He was a good team player, but now it's time to embrace a much more prominent role. Not as prominent as Kadary Richmond, who crossed enemy lines and made the switch from Seton Hall to SJU. Richmond will be on the short list of preseason Big East player of the year honors after averaging nearly 16 points at the Hall and scoring more than 1,200 points in his career. I think he's a dark horse choice for NPOY, too. Richmond will be set up by a great portal get in Deivon Smith, who averaged 13.3 points, 7.1 assists and 6.3 rebounds at Utah. Just a huge add there. Another key name is Vincent Iwuchukwu, who could benefit from a change in scenery after giving it an honest go the past two seasons at USC, following his heart scare in the summer of 2022. Look for Iwuchukwu to back up Zuby Ejiofor at the 5 and for North Texas 4-man Aaron Scott to be the first player off the bench. I love the talent blend and obviously trust the coaching. This could be UConn's biggest challenger in the Big East, and after last March's fireworks at MSG, who doesn't want to see more of that? Longtime readers know (and love?) my penchant for taking a few big swings every year in my top 25. Similar to St. John's, I am all the way in on Wake Forest: Top 15 Team. I'm just as in on the idea that lead guard Hunter Sallis will become a First Team All-American after bypassing the NBA Draft. Sallis averaged 18.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists and shot 40.5% from 3 last season. He's the latest transfer to downright thrive in Steve Forbes' system. Did Forbes land his transfers based on his reputation for being a portal whisperer? "Oh, without question — because they were offered way more money by other people," Forbes told me last season. "You have to have some (NIL), you can't just come in here empty handed. But, Hunter made a business decision. He did his homework." Sallis' jolt of confidence has Wake Forest's fanbase feeling more beatific heading into a November than it's been in a decade-plus. Sallis is super-receptive to coaching, has an insatiable work ethic and everyone in the program follows his lead. This year, Sallis carries Wake into the upper echelon of the ACC and gets the Deacs to the NCAAs, snapping the school's eight-year drought. He returns alongside another key Deacon, Efton Reid. If Reid can avoid foul trouble, he could emerge as one of the best bigs in the conference. Cameron Hildreth is also back in the starting lineup, effectively playing a third guard. The point? That will be Ty-Laur Johnson (Louisville), but given this is Wake, new bodies abound. App State transfer Tre'Von Spillers will play the 4, while Omaha Biliew (Iowa State) and Davin Cosby (Alabama) will also be getting plenty of run in their new surroundings. When Wake Forest is wrecking teams, remember who was first aboard the ship. Like pretty much every Marquette fan, I'm a convert to the notion that Shaka Smart is in the perfect place for what he wants to achieve in his career. The Golden Eagles are averaging 25 wins per season through Smart's first three years. I think they hit that number in Year 4 … but I also must draw attention to the reality that this will be Smart's first season at MU without Tyler Kolek in the locker room. His leadership and presence helped cement the foundation for Smart's vision of a reborn Marquette program. Now Kolek's off in the NBA and soon to be playing in a building he once won a championship in: Madison Square Garden. The Golden Eagles should still be one of the Big East's best because they do in fact return their leading scorer. Kam Jones and his 17.2 points per game are still here, flanked in the backcourt by Stevie Mitchell and Chase Ross. Underestimate that troika at your own peril. Forward David Joplin is also back, and yeah this is the place where I remind you that Smart opted not to bring in a transfer yet again. He's making it work. Against the rip tides of the sport, Smart is pulling this off. (Big man Ben Gold is about to have a breakout season as well, you can practically smell it.) If this prediction proves correct and Marquette winds up with a No. 4 seed or better for the third straight season, Smart's going to be able to charge outrageous public appearance rates to speak at coaching clinics across the country. They've got something really strong going, and with nearly 73% of the team's minutes still here from a season ago, it's more than fair to give this lot the benefit of the doubt following two seasons in which they finished 13th and 10th at KenPom. After three seasons and 88 wins in the Pac-12, Tommy Lloyd now takes his high-octane offense into the Big 12. The Wildcats figure to be one of the five best teams in that outstanding conference — something reflected in the preseason AP Top 25, where Arizona ranked fifth among Big 12 teams but was still ranked 10th. (Damn.) It's practically unheard of to have five returning All-Americans in college basketball in this generation, but that's what we're getting. One of those five is the final Pac-12 (As We Knew It) Player of the Year: Caleb Love. He's back for one more season, which means Arizona will be irresistible to watch. Love had some really good moments last season, in addition to the expected dose of Anything Could Happen On This Possession (Watch Out!). Also returning: Jaden Bradley (love his defense; crazy underrated player) and KJ Lewis (big breakout potential as a sophomore). Those three will be Arizona's backcourt, and they'll start alongside 7-2 sophomore Motiejus Krivas and Horizon League POY Trey Townsend, who helped Oakland to that charmed Cinderella run. Lloyd should get some frontcourt insurance from Tobe Awaka, who arrives after playing for Tennessee. Reports out of Tucson also indicate Anthony Dell'orso and Henri Veesaar have been absolute studs, with freshman Carter Bryant exceeding expectations, too. It will be enticing to see how this team adapts to the Big 12. Is Arizona going to come in and be as good in its first year the way Houston was last season? That wouldn't be a shock, but I'm going to stop short of that. I like a team in the 3-5 seed range that yet again will rank near the top of the most watchable offenses in choops. This is going to feel refreshing for everyone. John Calipari's time at UK needed to end. He did a lot of great things there, but the program was aching for a reboot. In comes affable alum Mark Pope, and what a flip this has been. Big Blue Nation went from despondent to delirious over the course of 48 hours after his hiring became public, a fan reaction reversion the likes of which I can't ever recall. So, how will the Wildcats look under new management? Pope has seemingly assembled a 10-deep roster without holding on to a single player who was in uniform in Lexington last season. My best guess at the opening day starting five: Kerr Kriisa (WVU transfer), Lamont Butler (SDSU transfer), Andrew Carr (Wake Forest transfer), Jaxson Robinson (BYU transfer) and Amari Williams (Drexel transfer). Those five combined to average 60 points last season. First off the bench figures to be 3-point specialist Koby Brea, who might even play his way into the starting role. Brea's commitment to UK solidified this roster's validity as top 25-quality. Pope also has Ansley Almonor (16.4 ppg at Fairleigh Dickinson), Otega Oweh (11.4 ppg at Oklahoma) and Brandon Garrison (7.5 ppg at Oklahoma State), with Garrison's long-term potential being a building block for the Pope era. Freshmen Collin Chandler, Travis Perry and Trent Noah will give the UK staff a deployment that's deeper than just about any roster Calipari had at Kentucky. (Notice I didn't write "more talented.") With games against Duke, Gonzaga, at Clemson and vs. Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic, the Wildcats will be tested regularly. I can't wait to see how this behemoth of a program is reborn with a vastly different personality calling the shots. I got to spend an afternoon this spring at UCLA, and one of the big takeaways for the year ahead was how connected and mature the group was in Westwood. Mick Cronin needed this, you'll recall, because he was as vocally critical of his team as any coach last season. (To the point where some in college basketball wondered if he was looking for a way out. UCLA went 16-17 and was a huge letdown. Cronin had never been so out of answers.) Turns out, things weren't so bad as to have a roster revolt. Three players that combined to average 37 points last season are back: point guard Dylan Andrews, shooting guard Sebastian Mack and small forward Lazar Stefanovic. UCLA is also bringing back the 7-3 Aday Mara who, with Zach Edey gone, will be among the tallest players in the sport. There's more, of course. UCLA actually had NIL resources during this past cycle, so expect Cronin to go 10-deep thanks to bringing on five transfers that averaged double-digit scoring, led by Tyler Bilodeau (14.3 ppg at Oregon State) and Dominick Harris (14.3 ppg at Loyola Marymount). From 2020-23, Cronin had offenses that ranked 11th, 12th and 21st in efficiency at KenPom. Last season it cratered to 152. I'd be shocked if this group didn't at least get into the top 40 and with a team that is more 3-point reliant than any of Cronin's previous squads at UCLA. There might be some small sacrifice on the defensive end (which Cronin will understandably resist), but it's a worthwhile trade-off to get UCLA back into the top-25 conversation. I'm bullish on the Bruins in their first year in the Big Ten. The Bluejays clear a preseason top-20 designation thanks to getting resolute big man Ryan Kalkbrenner back for a fifth and final season. Kalkbrenner is the early automatic frontrunner for Big East defensive player of the year, which doubles in selling him as a top-five defender in the sport. (He's won DPOY in the Big East three years running and will tie Patrick Ewing's mark of four in a row if he does it again.) Big Kalk averaged 17.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 3.1 blocks for a borderline top-10 team. It won't be easy, but mark me down for it: He betters all of those numbers in '24-25. Fortunately, Kalk is back with Mason Miller and Steven Ashworth also returning to the fold. That's critical in Creighton's quest to capture top-three status in the Big East for a sixth time in a seven-year stretch. It won't be easy due to the losses of Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander, both of whom are now in the NBA. And I wonder about CU's depth. The big portal get was Pop Isaacs, who averaged 15.8 points in a clattering season at Texas Tech. Isaac Traudt should be a growth prospect as a movable 4-man in Greg McDermott's system. Every year we get a handful of teams that are capable of only playing seven guys yet maintain nationally ranked status. I think the Jays are going to clear that bar, extending one more year in what's unequivocally been the best stretch of success in program history. Switching from Juwan Howard to Dusty May is going to be a near-180 culture overturn in Ann Arbor. Howard ultimately closed himself off to too many people and became too stubborn in trying to run a program. It redounded negatively on him to the point where AD Warde Manuel was effectively forced to go back on his word and fired Howard in March. In comes May, who won 126 games and averaged 21 wins in his six seasons at Florida Atlantic, which is outstanding considering the embarrassing lack of history and resources he embraced when he got that job in 2018. Michigan won out over Louisville and Vanderbilt for May's services, and I'm ranking U-M higher than just about anyone because the transfer haul feels like an ideal combo of size, shooting, speed, athleticism and proven commodities. Only one player followed May from FAU: center Vlad Goldin. He'll play alongside Yale transfer Danny Wolf, who could wind up as one of the five best up-transfers in college hoops … if Goldin doesn't rank ahead of him. Wolf can play the 3, 4 or 5 and is an A-level passer, screen-setter and space eater on the interior. Michigan also landed the underrated Sam Walters from Alabama, entering-his-prime Roddy Gayle Jr. from Ohio State, two-way competitor Rubin Jones from North Texas and sneaky-good 3-point contributor Tre Donaldson from Auburn. EvanMiya.com ranks Michigan's transfer class No. 5, which I might argue is too low. Scottie Pippen's son Justin is a freshman on this team, and the return of shooting guard Nimari Burnett and combo forward Will Tschetter should give May what he had at FAU: a roster that reliably is 10-deep and full of basketball-obsessed team players. I'm always good (or bad) for a smattering of zesty prognostications, so here's another. Boise State winning the Mountain West and becoming a top-20 crew feels as thrilling of a preseason call as almost any I've got listed. Leon Rice is over the moon at having a point guard who's his ideal kind of floor general. His name is Alvaro Cardenas. He was an intra-conference foil for Rice; Cardenas played for Tim Miles at San Jose State and averaged 13.2 points, 5.5 assists and shot 39% from 3-point territory. And he should be the key to unlock Boise State's latest NCAA Tournament team — and its first NCAA Tournament win in school history? We'll see. No program has made more Big Dances without a victory than the Broncos (0-10). BSU's best player is Tyson Degenhart. One of many instances where a high-major player is playing for a team outside the power-conference structure. Degenhart, a 6-8 senior, is the most practical preseason pick for MW POY. He might average 20/night on his way to becoming an NBA pick in 2025. Degenhart will again suit up alongside O'Mar Stanley, an undersized 5 who nevertheless played his way onto the all-league second team last season. On first glance, Boise State's roster doesn't shout "best in the Mountain West," but the buy-in at point guard and the physicality and versatility in the frontcourt has me believing in the Broncos. How big of a step back was last season? Consider that Indiana State finished 38th at KenPom, while IU was all the way at 91 and well out of the NCAA Tournament conversation. Despite making the Big Dance in years 1 and 2, Mike Woodson enters Year 4 on uneasy ground after the frustrations that sprouted like weeds emerged a season ago. The Hoosiers shouldn't even entertain outcomes that threaten Woodson's job security, though, not with the roster he's put together. IU brings back a 15-point-per-game guy in Malik Reneau (15.4 ppg), a 10.6 point-per-game vet in Trey Galloway, plus a likely sophomore burst from Mackenzie Mgbako (12.2 ppg). The Hoosiers, operating with a healthy NIL budget, also recruited Oumar Ballo from Arizona and Myles Rice from Washington State (two top-100 players), in addition to some others, like Kanaan Carlyle, who I'm eager to see in new surroundings after a nondescript season at Stanford. The 3-point shooting (or lack thereof) is a glaring concern, but most everything else screams top-20 roster. Can IU do it? Can it finish as a top-25 team for the first time in almost a decade? I can't shake the feeling this is going to be a noisy season (and that can be a good thing in many respects) for Woodson's program. One major letdown is the nonconference schedule, which is sorely lacking in must-see matchups. It also will give Indiana a lot less slack come conference play if IU falls short of winning the Battle 4 Atlantis. The Cyclones were unquestionably a top-10 team last season. The defense rated No. 1 at KenPom. The Clones destroyed inferior opponents on the regular and deserved a top seed instead of the No. 2 they got on Selection Sunday. That said, as I do every year (to varying results, yes!), I have to fade some teams in order to heavily buy in on some others in against-the-grain fashion. Mark me down for having ISU scootch back a bit in the bloated, beastly Big 12. The starting five will be led by one of the best guards in the country, Tamin Lipsey, who should be much more respected and discussed — to the level he deserves — by the time we get to Christmas. Lipsey will be flanked in the backcourt by senior Keshon Gilbert, who led the team in usage last season and probably will again this year. T.J. Otzelberger also brings back one of the more promising sophomores in the Big 12, Milan Momcilovic, who will play the 3. In the frontcourt, Saint Mary's transfer Joshua Jefferson and Charlotte newcomer Dishon Jackson will likely be starters. I'm wondering about the reliability up front, which is why I've opted to slightly sell on ISU's outlook. Overall, there's little question about this team's NCAA chances and its defensive pedigree. They can win ugly, but few care about style when the Ws rack up. This school should be dancing for the fourth straight year which would mark only the second time in program history that's happened. 10, 23, 14, 4, 8, 6, 6, 20. That's the final KenPom ranking for the No. 2 Big Ten over the past eight seasons. Illinois might be No. 2 this season, but it has been No. 2 (and sometimes No. 1) in the Big Ten over the past five seasons. Brad Underwood has a program humming, and that's a fact because he's made a habit of losing all-league guys and not falling too far behind. He'll carry on without Terrence Shannon Jr., Coleman Hawkins, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, Dain Dainja and Luke Goode. That's tons to overcome, but I have faith he'll do it thanks to some stars in the making that should find new life in Champaign. It will start with a guy I've been told has been insanely good in practice: freshman lead guard Kasparas Jakucionis. The Lithuanian could be a 2025 lottery pick. He'll join forces with Kylan Boswell, who averaged 9.6 points and 3.6 assists in a hot-and-cold two-year run with Arizona. Those two are the key, and they'll have help from Ty Rodgers and Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn, both of whom need to emerge as more consistent contributors. Carey Booth is a fledgling talent who couldn't get it going at Notre Dame. I like his chances to be a solid piece off the bench. Underwood also will bank on Ben Humrichous (14.7 ppg at Evansville) and Tre White (12.3 with Louisville) being minutes-eaters alongside two top-30 freshmen in 3-man Will Riley and 5 Morez Johnson. Illinois can be both the surprise and the reliable, pragmatic choice as a top-four finisher in the Big Ten. The tempting sleeper in the SEC. Todd Golden's Gators return three players (Walter Clayton Jr. and Will Richard in the backcourt, Alex Condon as a big) who averaged 20-plus minutes last season. They'll all be starters alongside transfers Alijah Martin (FAU) and, most likely, Rueben Chinyelu (Washington State). Martin committing to UF was a big-time add; he's an opportunistic scorer and is going to be one of the best man-to-man defenders in the SEC. With his Final Four pedigree, Martin figures to rise Florida's floor. Sophomore forward Thomas Haugh has also made huge strides in the offseason and will be the sixth man at worst. Clayton's savvy playmaking ability will likely lead to him being a top-four lead guard in the SEC. He's high-IQ, no doubt, and now the goal is to perk his 3-point accuracy from 36% and change to that ever-coveted 40% threshold. The Gators haven't yet returned to that upper-echelon SEC program that they could claim for a good portion of Billy Donovan's time, but Golden has the temperament and intellect to get there. Surprising though it may seem, Kansas State is now one of the biggest players in the transfer market. That was proven when Jerome Tang's program landed what's acknowledged as the most expensive portal get of 2024: Coleman Hawkins. The price? North of $2 million. The longtime Illinois stretch 4 will need to be one of the 20-or-so best players in American to both validate his NIL tag and lift K-State to top-25 status. I believe he will, and that's why I have the Wildcats ranked accordingly. Tang also brought on Achor Achor from Samford, Dug McDaniel from Michigan, Ugonna Onyenso from Kentucky and Max Jones from Cal State Fullerton, where he quietly/reliably averaged 15.3 points. Villanova transfer Brendan Hausen also will play north of 20 minutes per night. It's a big roster changeover, one of the starkest of any Power Five program that didn't undergo a coaching flip in '24. Tang was heavily courted by Arkansas but turned down the Razorbacks. He's where he wants to be and no question has the talent to get back to the Big Dance after missing out last year. Who amongst us can't wait to see John Calipari's final phase in Fayetteville? The Razorbacks' new coach returns just one player from the Eric Musselman regime, but he's a key one: Trevon Brazile. The stretchy 4-man opted to stick around for a rebuild that has some attention-grabbing parts. DJ Wagner followed Calipari from Kentucky, as did Adou Thiero and Zvonimir Ivišić. The latter two will be complementary pieces who could shine from time to time, but it's Wagner that seems to be the key. He took a backseat last season, despite starting, because of the dazzling play from Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. Those two are now in the NBA. Wagner hopes to be there a year from now, but the thing is, his style is close to Johnell Davis, who was an 18.2 ppg guy at FAU last season and is also on the Hogs' roster. That duo needs to learn to play off each other to give Arkansas a shot at landing in the top four of the SEC. And that's before taking into account that freshman Boogie Fland is also going to want the ball in his hands. Fland arrives alongside Karter Knox and Billy Richmond, all three switching allegiances from Kentucky shortly after Calipari fled for Hog heaven. Defensively, the Razorbacks will be viable for one man above all others: Jonas Aidoo. The Tennessee transfer averaged 11.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and was subsequently feverishly recruited in the portal. The class ranked No. 6 in the sport, per EvanMiya.com. To the shock of nobody, Calipari has recruited an enviable cluster of talent. He will have to embrace some late-career reinventions in order to dodge the flare-up of disappointments that became toxic in Lexington. Whether he's capable remains to be seen. But given who he convinced to follow him to Arkansas, this team has no excuse not to be one of the 30 best in college hoops. The last time MSU had a seed better than No. 7 was 2019 (though it would have been either a No. 2 or No. 3 in 2020). We're waiting on the return of vintage Michigan State. Will it happen in 2025? How many years does Tom Izzo still want to do this? Two more? Five? Whatever it is, I do expect Sparty to qualify for a 27th straight NCAA Tournament and for this team to be embedded in the strong and deep second tier in the Big Ten. A lot of pieces return from a 20-15 squad that ranked top-20 at KenPom. In fact, MSU is pretty well-stocked, considering Tyson Walker, Malik Hall, A.J. Hoggard and Mady Sissoko are all gone. Jeremy Fears, Jaden Akins (he's the key) and Tre Holloman all return and will combo for a three-headed backcourt that I'd like to see push the issue a lot more than last season's unhurried scheme. In the frontcourt, Coen Carr and Xavier Booker ready for their sophomore close-ups, and it sounds like Jaxon Kohler's role should spike. The roster looks like one breakout candidate after another. Plus, a family tree has been planted. Jase Richardson, a freshman, is the son of a guy who carries a pretty great legacy in East Lansing: Jason Richardson. Good group. Given it's Izzo, I openly admit to the very real possibility that I've under-ranked his group, I just want to see it come together before putting MSU into the top 25. The best news here is Johni Broome has a real chance to challenge a rival player on a rival team, Alabama's Mark Sears, for SEC Player of the Year. Broome averaged 16.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 2.2 apg, 2.2 bpg and was a 55% shooter for a 27-win Auburn team that finished (HELLO!) fourth at KenPom. Yes: fourth — despite losing to Yale in the first round — the best finish in school history, even if the Big Dance result didn't correlate. (Nugget: 2018 Virginia and 2016 Michigan State are the only other teams to ever lose in the first round and finish top-five at KenPom.) Now Bruce Pearl has a group with sites set again on winning the SEC, though as you can see I'm a seller on that idea. Every year there are a few teams ranked in the preseason that prove to be overshots, and I'll take a chance Auburn applies here. I already know the tut-tutting from Auburn fans is going to follow me well into the season. I've accepted it. For reasons hard to foresee, some teams just take steps back. Chad Baker-Mazara and Denver Jones return, and those two should be double-digit scorers alongside Broome. Furman's JP Pegues, who dropped 18.4 a night last season, will also squeeze in here as a viable option in Pearl's offense. The transfer class isn't great, though: EvanMiya ranks this class 70th in the country and second-worst in the SEC, a league so stacked that surprise results are unavoidable. And given how good Auburn's schedule is (Houston, the Maui Invitational, Duke, Ohio State, Purdue; it's loaded) in the noncon, it's going to take on some losses before what I think will be one of the toughest SEC slates in the conference. Sean Miller instantly steered Xavier back toward its typical realm of success in his first season (a No. 3 seed and a Sweet 16 run), but last year was a humbling downgrade. X went 16-18 and battled health issues en route to a forgettable campaign. For Year 3, the Musketeers have some dark-horse potential in the Big East, even despite the loss of starting center Lassina Traore, who is already done for the year with a knee injury. However, Zach Freemantle will be 24 years old and get a fully healthy final season, which should lead to him being among the best bigs in the Big East. Freemantle is, essentially, a returning starter. The only other player that's true of is Dayvion McKnight. The fifth-year senior averaged 12.4 points, 4.8 assists, 3.7 rebounds and shot 37.2% on his 3s. Because Xavier was a non-factor, McKnight was probably one of the most underrated players in the Big East. He'll shine. The Musketeers brought in Indiana State transfer Ryan Conwell, who could be Souley Boum-esque in terms of his impact. Excellent shot-taker who averaged nearly 17 points for a witty Sycamores squad last season. Toledo transfer Dante Maddox Jr. is also in line to start, given his numbers last season (15.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 40.2 3-pt%). Given Miller's coaching acumen and the fact there are 10 players on this roster who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players, it would be a semi-stunner if X wasn't easily in the NCAAs. It's wild times at Memphis these days, which is to say: everything's normal. Penny Hardaway's program is under NCAA investigation again, it's unclear what said investigation will lead to, and it's undetermined if Hardaway's actually on the hot seat or not. He made unusual late-offseason staff changes. The Tigers missed the NCAAs in March. Fan engagement is spotty, due in part to school administrators passing on an opportunity to leave the American for the Pac-12. (For now?) This is not a well-run outfit at present. But what about the basketball players? With Houston out of the conference, Memphis is the king of the league and is my pick to be the AAC's best — despite losing five key pieces. Hardaway's most important add would seem to be Tyrese Hunter, the former Iowa State and Texas point guard who is a reliable jump shot and two inches away from being an NBA Draft pick. He's going to team up with Tulsa transfer and top-shelf scorer PJ Haggerty. The frontcourt will feature a familiar name: Moussa Cisse is boomeranging back to the Tigers for his final season; he's a great rim protector and should help with Memphis' signature defensive edge. Dain Dainja comes by way of Illinois. I think he's a great get. The champion of the American should be a top-30 team. Based on talent, Memphis is the logical pick. The Bearcats will break through in Year 4 of Wes Miller's regime and make the NCAAs, ending a drought that dates back to 2019. Miller's team finished 39th at KenPom last season; a noticeable bump up is in order yet again. UC fans' patience will be rewarded. Miller has the benefit of returning enough above-average pieces to be a feisty team in the thick Big 12. There is no outright star here, but then again, that's the Cincinnati way more often than not. Jizzle James' breakout sophomore season is an expectation; the physical combo guard needs to make a jump to justify this ranking. But bringing back Day Day Thomas and Dan Skillings Jr. in the backcourt is just as important for the objectives in Cincy. Their style contrasted against Aziz Bandaogo's standout defense — he will be featured in the middle — is going to give the Bearcats some matchup advantages. Bandaogo will be assisted by Simas Lukosius, who can roam on the wing as one of the more dependable 6-8 3-point shooters in the league. The intriguing name is Dillon Mitchell, who is using his last year of eligibility and figures to start at the 4. BYU was the surprise metrics darling in the Big 12 last season. I sense UC could be that team in '24-25. Some might have expected the Red Raiders to drift into obscurity after the short-lived, disastrous end to the Mark Adams era. Not at all. Grant McCasland was the right guy at the right time. TTU went 23-11 and got a 6-seed in 2024 — doing so with an offense-first philosophy. It should be in that ballpark again in 2025. Two critical transfers to know: PG Elijah Hawkins (Minnesota) and JT Toppin (New Mexico). Hawkins was one of the best pure distributors in college hoops as a Gopher. Toppin is a bouncy wing that does a little bit of everything and broke Lobo hearts when he left ABQ. Adding those two in with three guys back (Darrion Williams, Chance McMillian, Kerwin Walton) who combined to average 30-plus points gives the Red Raiders a sleeper's chance at being a Big 12 contender. Devan Cambridge is also back, and on his way to being healthy. A lot of promise with this team. (NOTE: This ranking and capsule were published hours before Tony Bennett's retirement was publicly disclosed. Virginia's slot will remain the same for official purposes, but had I known UVa would not have Bennett on the sidelines, I realistically would have put the Cavs much lower in my rankings.) The Wahoos have made all but two NCAA tourneys since 2012, and I'm confident that broad track of success continues in 2025. But it's time for UVa to get back to making its mark in March; the program's last Big Dance victory was against Texas Tech in the 2019 title game. Last season, Virginia was a no-show vs. Colorado State in the First Four. Losing Ryan Dunn and Reece Beekman early to the NBA (borderline priceless defenders) drops the Cavs' ceiling and essentially forces them out of top-25 consideration heading into November. Virginia brings back shooting guard Isaac McKneely and his reassuring 44.5% 3-point accuracy. Big man Blake Buchanan is situated for a breakout year and he's not going to be the only one in Charlottesville. The portal add who could be requisite to Virginia finishing in the top five of the ACC is a guy who was in the league last season, but barely made a mark. TJ Power opted out of Duke, knowing full well just how much talent was coming in. At Virginia he can become one of the breakout sophomores, provided he's bought into the program's defensive requirements. Anthony Grant is 135-55 in his last six seasons at UD, equating to a magnificent .711 winning percentage, the best in the Atlantic 10 in that span and one of the 15 best of any men's Division I coach. It's for that reason, above all others, that I will again forecast Dayton as the best team in the conference. The Flyers are the most consistent team in that league. There are some lowered expectations because of the loss of DaRon Holmes II, but UD fans have seen their team overcome significant losses of NBA-level talent before. Thankfully, Malachi Smith's return from injury should inject renewed optimism in Dayton, going along with the return of preseason A-10 first-teamer Nate Santos. Santos, Enoch Cheeks and Javon Bennett are the support columns, but it's the transfers that make me all in on Dayton's return to the Big Dance. (UD is coming off an NCAA appearance as a No. 7 seed, which included a win over Nevada in the first round.) The Flyers brought in former Ohio State big man Zed Key and well-traveled defensive specialist Posh Alexander, who are both old enough to be voting in a second presidential election. How a coach schedules tells me how confident he is in his team. UD is not only going to Maui, but Grant also has Marquette, UNLV, Cincinnati and Northwestern on the schedule. These guys might not be as good as last season, but I think they'll be relatively close. What encore is in store for the team that made its first Elite Eight in 44 years? The Tigers have a healthy chance at a fifth NCAA Tournament push under Brad Brownell (and it would be the first time ever under him that Clemson made back-to-back Big Dances) with the return of Chase Hunter at combo guard and power forward Ian Schieffelin. Had PJ Hall come back, Clemson would have easily been a preseason AP Top 25 team. Without him, they'll look to make up some ground and can get their bona fides on defense with Cincinnati transfer Viktor Lakhin. The Tigers will rely on Jaeden Zackery (11.2 ppg, 4.3 apg at Boston College) to be the primary 1-man. If he's efficient, Clemson can hope to be in the realm of last season's 117.7 adjusted offensive efficiency rating (per KenPom), a program-best number. I think the Tigers are a moving target in the ACC but am willing to give Brownell the benefit of the doubt and buy in on continued success and a top-five league finish for the fourth time in five seasons.. Randy Bennett's Gaels have won 26 or 27 games in four of the past five seasons, with the COVID-affected 2020-21 campaign being the exception. It's fair to brace for a little step back here, as Aidan Mahaney left for UConn and Alex Ducas graduated. Josh Jefferson also decided to portal it out of there. I love that Mitchell Saxen is here again for a fifth and final season, though. I'd rank him among the 15 best bigs in the sport. With Saxen and the 7-1 Harry Wessels making life hell in the paint, Saint Mary's is again going to be rugged and not to be trifled with on defense. And sure, the Aussie pipeline is still flowing into Moraga, California, but Bennett's also added a couple of Lithuanians to boot. Had Mahaney stayed it would've benefited the program, but SMC fans know that Augustas Marciulionis was the team's better floor general anyway. He's back for a senior season on a squad that is again going to firmly be No. 2 in the WCC behind Gonzaga. Oh, nothing. It's only the most anticipated season in Rutgers history. Steve Pikiell and his assistant, Brandin Knight, diligently worked for years to recruit two blue-chip studs — Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey — and here they are. Yes, Rutgers will suit up quite possibly two future top-five NBA Draft picks. This is going to be fascinating, to say the least. Harper will run the offense; he's the younger brother of Ron Harper Jr., who is one of the best players in program history. Bailey is a bouncy wing who might be the most athletic freshman in the country. Those two won't explicitly be tasked with being the leaders of this team, but from the outside in, that's how it will be viewed. Harper and Bailey all but guarantee a big jump from last year's putrid offense, which ranked 295th at KenPom. Harper gets the benefit of starting beside Jeremiah Williams, who started 11 of his 12 games last season after returning from injury. No one's quite sure how this is going to go, and questions loom with RU's interior defense, but few teams in '24-25 will rank as high in watchability as the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. What a world. I like this world! The Aztecs get a top-40 designation from me due to coaching stability and proven culture. This program lost a LOT from 2023-24: Jaedon LeDee (that one's gonna leave a mark), Lamont Butler, Micah Parrish, Darrion Trammell. The best returnee is Reese Waters (9.6 ppg, 3.7 rpg). A year ago, nobody had LeDee as a top-20 player in the country, but that's precisely what he became. Can Waters make a jump that's in that ballpark? He'll get help with Miles Byrd, a stretchy wing who symbolizes a lot of what makes SDSU's defense so firm year in, year out. One new name to know is former FAU guard Nick Boyd, who has a swagger on the court that will fit right in with Brian Dutcher's program. Boyd might be good for a couple of 25-point nights, and in turn, could improve the Aztecs' chances at winning yet another Mountain West title. The MW will soon degrade, due to SDSU leaving alongside a few other teams. In these next two years, it should be a compelling battle for supremacy before this league is subdued — so soon after its best season in history. With a workable troop of fourth- and fifth-year players, plus the arrival of a five-star big man, the Terrapins can course-correct in a big way from last season's letdown. Kevin Willard's team was a confounding 16-17, done in by awful 3-point shooting and a stagnant offense. Look for that to change due to the arrival of Belmont transfer Ja'Kobe Gillespie (38.7% from beyond the arc) and South Florida import Selton Miguel (39%). Maryland lost Donta Scott and Jahmri Young, but Julian Reese is back in the frontcourt and will play the 4 alongside freshman center and local high school hero Derik Queen, who ranked 12th in the Class of 2024 according to 247Sports. Reese's defense should help Maryland rank well nationally in efficiency. I don't know if Queen will be high-impact in the first six weeks of the season, but I think he rounds into form by February and gets Maryland firmly into the bubble mix. The Longhorns' shift into the SEC (this feels like it's going to take some getting used to) is going to coincide with a big shift in the roster. A lot of old hands are no longer wearing burnt orange: Max Abmas, Dylan Disu, Tyrese Hunter, Dillon Mitchell, even Brock Cunningham (gone already? I jest) have moved on. That equates to 80% of the team's minutes flipping for the season ahead. Rodney Terry essentially has a rebuild on his hands, but at least he's got a terrific freshman wing in Tre Johnson to do it with. Johnson is the sleeper pick to be the nation's best freshman. Ranked sixth overall in the class, he was a big-gulp scorer as a prospect and figures to have a lot of touches on a team that will be looking for guys to step up on offense. Johnson figures to start alongside four other guys who are all much older and seniors/fifth-year players. Kadin Shedrick is the most important returning UT player; he'll hold down the 5. Arthur Kaluma is in Austin to chase the NCAA Tournament after missing out last year at Kansas State. Tramon Mark is back in the state after a one-year detour with Arkansas. Look for him to be critical as a leader for Terry's team, which has some interesting pieces. I can see a way for Texas to make hay in the new-look SEC, but it's likely going to be in the bubble mix come March. It's hard to catapult season-ending momentum into the following campaign, but let's see if Pitt can do it. I like the Panthers to be a bubble team after missing out (narrowly) on the NCAAs last season following a 10-3 finish and a 22-11 record. Jeff Capel is now in Year 7, with one NCAA trip in the first six. Pitt's AD was unexpectedly let go this offseason, which could put Capel's job at risk if he severely underachieves, but I like this team to comfortably finish in the top half of the ACC and make the Big Dance. The Panthers have somewhat quietly moved into second-tier status in the ACC in the past couple of years. Will this group keep that going? The roster suggests a competitive team with a reasonable shot at winning north of 20 games again. Ishmael Leggett is a key player back, as is Jaland Lowe, who will be a pop guy in 2024-25, especially after Bub Carrington's meteoric rise to one-and-done NBA Draft lottery pick. Lowe could follow Carrington's course in 2025, honestly. Blake Hinson also no longer being here also dings Pitt a bit, but, but, but: The Panthers return four of their top six scorers, which is about as good of a situation as you can ask for at a high-major school that didn't make the tournament. If you missed Jackson Shelstad's freshman year, don't make a similar mistake this upcoming season. Shelstad (12.8 ppg) is probably among the 10 best sophomores in the sport, and he'll have a shot at being a first- or second-team guy in the Big Ten. (Still feels weird to type it, let alone read it.) Dana Altman was hoping to win an NCAA appeal to get one more season with N'Faly Dante, but that didn't happen. Who's the big man to step up now? Senior Nathan Bittle, who will have to pop his 10.0 points/4.4 rebounds line from last season. After a one-year East Coast junket at Villanova, former Washington State wing TJ Bamba has returned West to suit up as a Duck. I suspect he'll get north of 320 shots in 30-plus games. This is Dana Altman's 15th season in Eugene. The previous 14 featured 20 wins or more. In fact, Altman's coached 27 consecutive years above .500. Oregon might have question marks, but the track record mandates putting the Ducks comfortably in the top 50. I was absurdly high on the Aggies last season (we're talking irrationally high), only to see Buzz Williams' team pretty much perform where most others thought they'd be. A 21-15 record and a No. 9 seed. So: they were solidly solid, but a few matters short of pretty good. Will this group be more consistent? Wade Taylor IV returns for his senior season, and after averaging 19.1 points in 2023-24 (fourth-best in the SEC), he's got a chance to be No. 1 in the conference. A lot will filter down from Taylor's production. Fellow senior backcourt mate Manny Obaseki will be inserted into the starting lineup full time, getting that promotion along with another semi-starter from last season, Jace Carter on the wing. My concern with ranking A&M higher is tied to the reality that Williams is yet to have a quality shooting team in his five seasons with the program. Every one he's had has rated outside the top 150 in 2- and 3-point percentage, many outside the top 200. Until that changes, A&M is going to have a limit on its proficiency and efficiency inside the SEC and out. After losing out to Duke in the high-stakes dual recruitment of Cameron and Cayden Boozer (who will be in college in 2025), Jim Larrañaga now focuses most of his energy on reversing the bad vibes that concluded Miami's 2023-24 season, an unspeakable 10-game nightmare that rendered the Canes irrelevant at 15-17. Nijel Pack and Matthew Cleveland decided to stay in Coral Gables, Florida, and that will prove vital to Miami's chances to be a bubble team in the ACC. The Hurricanes lost a lot from last season's team, but those two were the ones they couldn't afford to see leave. Cleveland and Pack joining forces with a fun freshman, shooting guard Jalil Bethea, in addition to Stetson transfer Jalen Blackmon (who had the game of his life in the ASUN title game, erupting for 43 points and getting the Hatters into the field of 68) will ensure this squad is potent and powerful in shot selection and creation. Few teams underachieved harder relative to the talent on the roster than The U a season ago. I can't see Larrañaga standing for that again. It might not be as good as Miami's football team in 2024, but The U will be back in the better half of the ACC. What a highly unusual situation in Columbus. Chris Holtmann was fired on Valentine's Day and everyone presumed the Buckeyes would chase, and land, a buzzy name. (Dusty May was the presumed initial target.) But Jake Diebler went from interim to full-time coach, thanks to going 8-3 after moving over a seat. Diebler has done well in his first season in terms of roster assembly. Most importantly, Bruce Thornton stuck around for one more season with the Bucks. I think he's got a great chance to be a top-five player in the Big Ten. He'll team up with boomerang transfer Meechie Johnson, who is back in an OSU uni after two years with South Carolina. Diebler recruited two former five-star prospects who didn't pan out at the blue-blood level: Sean Stewart (Duke) and Aaron Bradshaw (Kentucky). They're likely to start with another transfer, an understated team guy, Micah Parrish of San Diego State, who will be a utility guy to say the least. Not having Taison Chatman (torn ACL) will ding Ohio State's depth in the backcourt, unless 6-foot freshman Juni Mobley emerges as one of the best 3-point shooters in the Big Ten with haste. Diebler as a head coach of a high-major with no experience other than February and March's abbreviated trial run will make this a TBD season. But the talent should have OSU a bubble team at minimum. A year ago, I aggressively placed Georgia in the top 50 of my rankings, which I'm brave enough to admit was a fatuous mistake. This season, it's not such a fable. The Bulldogs fully expect to be competitive and in the top half of the SEC, thanks above all to anticipated reforms with the team's rebounding. (It's been baaaaaad.) Mike White has two players back who will be starters in Silas Demary Jr. and Blue Cain. Demary really might be the most undervalued player in the SEC. Also key: White has a freshman in Asa Newell who is the most talented newbie to come onto that campus (for basketball, anyway) since Anthony Edwards. Newell's game is nothing like Edwards, however. He's lean, stands approximately 6-10, can step out and shoot and plays with a good head on his shoulders. He'll need to be a top-10 freshman in the country to validate my UGA ranking, and I think he's gonna pull it off. Look for Demary to step up and be one of the best defenders in the SEC — with backup De'Shayne Montgomery not that far behind. Tyrin Lawrence (via Vandy) and RJ Godfrey (via Clemson) should round out the starting five. Kim English is on a mission to not put PC in the position it was last season, when spotty metrics results wound up holding the Friars outside the velvet rope to get into the NCAAs. That team won 21 games and did so without Bryce Hopkins (while Devin Carter turned into the Big East Player of the Year). Hopkins is back, however, and approaching 100% status after tearing his left ACL. Look for the combo forward to increase his previous Friar averages of 15.6 ppg and 8.6 rebounds, and in the process, potentially become the most valuable player on a Big East roster. English dipped into the portal and added Bensley Joseph (Miami), Wesley Cardet Jr. (Chicago State) and Christ Essandoko (Saint Joe's) to help out returning guard Jayden Pierre (9.5 ppg). With Josh Oduro now in the NBA, watch Oswin Erhunmwunse step in and patrol the paint. Every year when I build out this list, there are invariably a half-dozen power-conference teams that feel like their range could be anywhere from No. 30 to No. 70. Providence is one of those teams this year. The Lobos were laughably only put into the Big Dance last season because they won the Mountain West tourney title after an enthralling run that included five wins in the final six games prior to March Madness. UNM's inclusion gave the Mountain West a conference-record six bids. This team probably can't match the firepower and athleticism of that one, but it can best it in tenacity and resourcefulness. Much of that will spring from junior guard Donovan Dent, one of the best players in the Mountain West. Dent, whose gumption is on display multiple times a night, averaged 14.1 points and figures to up that number in 2024-25. He'll have returning C Nelly Junior Joseph starting with him, giving Richard Pitino's team a couple of go-to guys in very different positions. I have to ding UNM for the losses of Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn Jr. and JT Toppin, but the program's arrow has been going in the good direction since Pitino arrived three years ago and doesn't seem likely to go crooked over the next six months. It's time for the Braves to ascend to the top of the Missouri Valley — and become one of the best mid-major teams in the process. Brian Wardle, in this his 10th season in Peoria, Illinois, has his best team. And consider: Bradley ranked 64th at KenPom last season. Thanks to returning much of his roster (led by point guard Duke Deen and 5-man Darrius Hannah), Wardle can rely on veteran experience and a locker room with great chemistry. The Braves have to overcome losing their leading scorer (Connor Hickman) and best defender (Malevy Lyons), but seem to have most boxes checked for a mid-major darling. Great size, culture established, good guard play, capable 3-point shooting. The Braves have two MVC tourney championships under Wardle but just one NCAA appearance because 2020 was ripped away. Drake had been the Cinderella candidate in the Valley in recent years, and now Bradley should take that mantle. The Blazers are equipped with four returning starters from a 23-win team. If Memphis doesn't wind up as the best team in the AAC, UAB (officially the preseason league favorite) is the obvious candidate to take the top slot. Any team that deploys a man in the middle with the first name Yaxel and a pesky guard nicknamed "Butta" figures to be set up for a certain level of success, deemed necessary by the basketball gods. Yaxel Lendeborg is a 6-9 hoss — a senior center who will threaten to finish with 25 double-doubles. Butta Johnson is a bit of a dynamo who should see his shot opportunities improve playing next to underrated Georgia Southern transfer Tyren Moore. UAB will be a problem in the American because Lendeborg is complemented by Christian Coleman, a power forward with a tough nose around the rim. Kennedy knows his team's defensive issues last season sold them short. We should expect a more well-rounded squad in Birmingham. Everyone knows the deal on the Main Line. Kyle Neptune needs to make the NCAA Tournament in order to get to a fourth year with Nova. The program has quickly gone from a rock-solid top-10 reputation to confounding disappointment over the past two seasons. Now the Cats ready for a campaign with only seven players holding D-I experience. Five of those seven, at least, are 21, 22 or 23 years old. Eric Dixon opted to stay, and that might be the thing that saves VU and keeps them competitive in the Big East. He and Jordan Longino will be the team's leaders, while Wooga Poplar (via Miami) was the Big Transfer Get that Nova desperately needed in the back end of the portal cycle. Villanova hasn't missed the NCAAs three years in a row since Jay Wright's first three on the Main Line (2002-04). In order to avoid that in 2025, Neptune's going to have to overachieve with a roster that ranks well outside the top five of the Big East. A program under pressure that has responded well in previous iterations. What will this one do? If you're outside the top 50 you probably aren't in as a bubble team come March, but I think BU is one of the best sleeper NCAA candidates out there. Thad Matta's toiled a bit for two years in Indy, yes, however his coaching acumen can't be questioned. By bringing back much of the roster from an 18-win team, the expectation should be to hit 20 victories. The two biggest names still here are G/F Pierre Brooks and F Jahmyl Telfort. They'll be wonderful on a team that should move into the top 50 of offensive efficiency. I do wonder about the defensive integrity and the lack of higher-end athletes. Tulane transfer Kolby King is a guy who will also emerge here, but needs to beef up into a strong two-way player to bolster the loss of Posh Alexander. A veritable mid-major beast these days. Bryce Drew's program is coming off a first-round upset of Saint Mary's in the 5/12 game, giving GCU a program-record 30th win in the process. The Antelopes were 65th in my rankings a year ago, which proved too low. I'm bumping 'em up that much more heading into November. Four starters return, led by Tyon Grant-Foster, a 20-point-per-game guard who is one of the three-or-so most talented mid-major players in the sport. If bringing back a healthy portion of the team's scoring and minutes wasn't enough to convince you this team can win another NCAA Tournament game, know that TCU transfer JaKobe Coles and his 42% 3-point accuracy is also in the mix here. The Lopes are overwhelming WAC favorites yet again before the program moves on to the WCC next year. Non-Rambler fans, If I ask you what this team's win total was last season, you think you can guess it within two spots? Loyola Chicago went 23-10 in a critical bounce-back campaign after the disastrous 10-win season the year prior. For as good and improved as LUC was last season, the program sure didn't seem like it received a fair amount of attention and publicity. Drew Valentine will need to have another 20-win season to get his flowers, and I'm here to project he will. Three starters are back at a program that retained five rotation players in all and should have the makings of a top-40 per-possession defense. Miles Rubin averaged just 6.2 points, but I don't know how many players who didn't score 10 per game were more valuable, at least at the mid-major level, than him. He set the program record with 76 blocks in a season. Rubin, Des Watson (high-end A-10 player) and Jayden Dawson will be the triumvirate taking on a not-so-mysterious-but-still-sorta-unpredictable top third of the Atlantic 10. The Ramblers upgraded to this conference from the MVC two years ago. This is the season they show they made the right decision. Here's a big swing. It was a slog in Year 1 under Micah Shrewsberry, as anticipated, but I'm tagging the Irish to be one of the more surprising high-majors in the months ahead. Shrews was able to retain four starters, the most important being point guard Markus Burton (17.5 ppg, 4.3 apg, 3.3 rpg at 5-foot-11). Burton gets to play beside a utilitarian transfer who should fit like a glove: Princeton guard Matt Allocco. ND brings back guys who don't have big Q scores but are highly valued on that campus: Tae Davis, Braeden Shrewsberry and J.R. Konieczny. The Irish are going to punch above their weight and steal a few games as a home underdog. The program's been on fire recently with some big-time recruiting wins. Notre Dame will likely be a projected NCAA team a year from now, but in this bridge season I like Shrewsberry's crew to go from 13 wins to at least five more than that in '24-25. With all due respect to the predictive metrics out there and how they're formulated and calculated, the Bulls team I saw last season looked better than the one listed online. USF ranked 87th at KenPom, 84th at Torvik, 78th at EvanMiya and 91st at BPI. I'm not going to say USF was a top-60 team last season, because the data's in and the data across different algorithms is correct. However, if you watched USF occasionally and saw how that fan base was reinvigorated, how well-coached it was under Amir Abdur-Rahim and its new life as a 25-win team, you saw top-50 aura. Despite Abdur-Rahim not taking a bigger job after just one year, but losing vital pieces regardless, I'm buying in with the Bulls. I think they play their way to a second consecutive 20-win season. I think they build on a fun story in Tampa. I think they do it behind lead guard Jayden Reid. He's an easy candidate for AAC POY consideration, and he'll likely be tasked with a lot after USF got poached in the portal. Reid has Brandon Stroud and Kobe Knox flanking him, giving the Bulls the uncommon situation of coming off a good year with returning pieces, but likely being underrated. (Except here, of course.) USF has a good policy in place: replace the departing coach with the best-qualified in-house candidate. It did this in 2019 when Kyle Smith left and Todd Golden scooted a seat over. Then, when Golden took the Florida job in 2022, Chris Gerlufsen was promoted from within. Since then, the Dons have gone 43-25 and maintained top-four status in the WCC, which is where they'll be again for the next five months. Gerlufsen is fortunate to return four high-leverage players from last season's 23-11 team: Marcus Williams, Malik Thomas and Ndewedo Newbury (all seniors), plus sophomore combo guard (and somewhat rare non-Gonzaga WCC freshman of the year winner) Ryan Beasley. This team wasn't free throw-prone a season ago, something that should change for the better. A nice offense is likely to upgrade to a good one, and the defense can again be top-60 in the nation. That will lay the course for USF's inside track to third place in the WCC behind Gonzaga and Saint Mary's. What Will Wade did to change the situation in mere months' time in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is outrageous. McNeese won 30 games last year and finished 67th at KenPom, by far its best ever. Prior to 2023-24, McNeese's average KenPom finish in its history was 257th; the Cowboys finished between 276 and 335 in the 11 preceding years. Then Wade arrives and all the suck and ineptitude is vaporized out of the program. McNeese had a 19-game turnaround, tying an NCAA record. And remember, Wade had to sit for the opening stretch of last season because of suspension. Of course, he's only there because of the NCAA violations and stain from his LSU days, but regardless, this is now a low-major monster. McNeese will rule the Southland with ease again. Look for Christian Shumate (awesome two-way player), Ole Miss transfer Brandon Murray and Saint Louis transfer Sincere Parker to guide the Cowboys to at least 25 wins again. THE story with Wisconsin is how it fares after being brutalized by the portal ("portalized"?) after being upset as a 5-seed in the first round by James Madison. The Badgers watched Chucky Hepburn (Louisville), AJ Storr (Kansas) and Connor Essegian (Nebraska) walk away, dropping their ceiling in the process. This is a program that's held a lot of stability in roster retention — doing so against the currents of the sport — but this year was different. At least Steven Crowl, Max Klesmit and John Blackwell stuck around. (Tyler Wahl graduated, alas.) There can be good portal news, though: John Tonje was a non-factor at Mizzou last year because of injury, but it wouldn't stun me at all if he was a double-double guy in his final college season. Greg Gard has a big task ahead in what seems fated to have Wisconsin floating in the middle of a boggy Big Ten. One of about five teams in the ACC that I think has the capacity to finish as high as seventh and as low as 15th. It's just so tough to tell in this first year of overwrought high-major expansion. The Orange bring back JJ Starling, who's a lot of fun and should be in striking distance of averaging 17 points. Eddie Lampkin (previously of TCU and Colorado renown) will pay rent on the low block for his final year of eligibility. Junior wing Chris Bell (41.7% from 3-point land) is underrated and may unlock this team's ceiling. Hofstra transfer Jaquan Carlos is also getting some buzz in the preseason, so we're on the lookout for him. I like the Orange to finish top 10 in the ACC, but it could be a bumpy route to the finish. Consider how Red Autry won 20 games in his debut season. SU should be in that range again. This is a respectable jump from last season's Mississippi debut for Chris Beard, which included 20 wins (good) but also had the Rebels finish 79th at Torvik and 86th at KenPom (not good). The Rebels return PG Jaylen Murray and combo guard Matthew Murrell, in addition to 6-8 wing Jaemyn Brakefield. The defense was barely adequate at times, and now Jamarion Sharp, Moussa Cisse and Allen Flanigan have moved on. Can the group be collectively better? How will the scheme change? There's a lot to prove in the frontcourt. I've got some reservations over Beard getting this new roster (which includes four senior transfers, led by Sean Pedulla and Dre Davis) to be good enough on defense to make the NCAA Tournament. But the scoring capability will likely lead to some barn-burning atmospheres every month. Someone's going to surprise in the Big 12. Why not the Knights? Johnny Dawkins' team had three eyebrow-raising wins last season (Kansas, at Texas and at TCU), which has me thinking this program could be in for more party spoiling. Because UCF isn't appointment TV, it has one of the most unheralded (but reliable) duos in high-major ball. Watch out for guards Jaylin Sellers and Darius Johnson. They combined to average 31 points last season and could hit the 35 mark this season. The strange thing here is there's a bunch of guys on this roster who back stories that are longer than novellas (Mikey Williams, Dior Johnson, Benny Williams), but if the chemistry is in line, UCF will have top-half-of-the-league talent in the Big 12. And should the defense again rate top-30, like last year, then this outlook won't be bullish. Wolf Pack fans found me with a quickness a year ago when I stupidly neglected to include Nevada in my top 101. (Steve Alford's team was soundly in the top 60 of all metrics at year's end.) No such mistake this year. This is easily a top-70 roster. Alford is running it back with his three best at the 3, 4 and 5: Tre Coleman, Nick Davidson and KJ Hymes. Not many teams are able to claim the same. Look for Nevada to be in the thick of the NCAA convo because of its size and know-how. The backcourt of Tyler Rolison (big-time role increase) and Kobe Sanders (Cal Poly transfer) might take a little time to jell, but so long as they're counterplaying off the gravity from the aforementioned frontcourt, Rolison and Sanders are going to have a lot of chances to capitalize with the spacing provided in Alford's system. If not for super-senior guard Max Shulga, the Rams would be about two dozen spots further down on this list. Shulga, who has spent his career with coach Ryan Odom, had a few weeks over the spring where he opted for a future at Villanova. But after careful consideration, he doubled back to Richmond and will be the focal point on one of the best teams in the A-10. Putting it plainly: VCU has valid NCAA hopes because Shulga's here. As a career 40% 3-point shooter, his leadership by example will be vital. Remember, the Rams went 24-14 last season and would have made the NCAA Tournament had they not stubbed their toe in the conference title game against Duquesne. Odom brings back three starters (Shulga, Joe Bamisile, Zeb Jackson) who also led the team in scoring, giving this group a realistic chance not just at winning the A-10, but at making up ground in the nonconference, where games and scheduling never come easy for VCU. I count no more than three programs, max, that will have to overcome the loss of a player the way Northwestern will with Boo Buie, who graduated as NU's all-time leading scorer. That aside, times are pretty sweet now in Evanston, Illinois. Chris Collins guided the team to a second straight NCAA Tournament bid, which was previously considered a fantasy for a school with just three of those in its history. NU will drag some higher-end Big Ten teams into escape room-type scenarios at Welsh-Ryan Arena, where it's had a handful of loud upset wins over ranked opponents in recent seasons. Key names back: Brooks Barnhizer, Ty Berry, Nick Martinelli. Barnhizer is quite the well-rounded player, especially when you consider how much time he spends on the floor (more than 90% of minutes last season) without having noticeable efficiency drop-offs. Chris Jans is the only coach in Bulldogs history to make the NCAAs in his first two seasons. (He's the only coach to reach the Big Dance in Year 1, too.) It's been a really good fit from the get-go in Starkville. The Bulldogs do have quite the makeover, bringing aboard six transfers and two freshmen. The best player back is one of the best sophomores in college basketball. Josh Hubbard averaged 17.1 points as a 5-9 combo guard in a defense-leaning scheme. Can't wait to see how he follows up a delectable debut season. Hubbard is the guy on offense, while Cameron Matthews is the platonic ideal of a switchable 6-7 defender. MSU figures to rank top-30 in defensive efficiency behind the captaincy of Matthews, who will be in the mix for SEC Defensive Player of the Year. I presume I'll be lower on the Bulldogs than other preseason rankings. It's not about Jans. Instead, it's more due to the very likely scenario the SEC is a top-two league, in addition to my wait-and-see approach on the portal compilation in Starkville, which needs to prove its offensive capacity. Most everyone (yep, yours truly included) was wrong a year ago when BYU was projected in the bottom half of the Big 12, only to see Mark Pope win 23 games and finish in the top 20 in advanced-metrics rankings. Now Pope is at Kentucky and Kevin Young — a longtime NBA assistant, most recently with the Suns — has made the pivot to the college game. This will be one fascinating experiment, as Young is going to try to NBA-ify the Cougs while also adhering to certain structure and schemes fitted for college. Fortunately for Young, he was able to retain Dallin Hall, Trevin Knell, Fousseyni Traore and Richie Saunders, all of whom could have left but chose to keep on with BYU's unique culture. It's likely to be bumpy in Year 1, but the vision is to fund BYU and turn it into one of the top four programs in the Big 12 by the end of the decade. (Case in point: The Cougars are a major player for the top prospect in the country, AJ Dybantsa.) Young might pull a Pope and wildly overshoot expectations again, but I'll give the Coogs plenty of slack in his first season. What the Wolfpack did in March/April amounted to the most statistically improbable Final Four run ever. From trailing putrid Louisville in the first half of the first game of the ACC tourney to winning nine straight (which had never been done before) and making history in reaching the Final Four. Will there be a hangover in Raleigh? DJ Burns, Casey Morsell and DJ Horne won't be there to experience it. Kevin Keatts returns Jayden Taylor, Michael O'Connell and Ben Middlebrooks. Louisville transfer Brandon Huntley-Hatfield will step in and play the 4 and/or the 5 and probably be ecstatic to be in new surroundings. Last season's team found a way to scout effectively, capitalize on mismatches (a lot of this was Burns) and never take stretches off in games. It will need to do this to maximum effect in order to get back to the NCAAs. Ohio is blessed to bring back six of its top eight players from last season. Senior guard Shereef Mitchell is the latest sturdy captain in the backcourt. Combo forward AJ Clayton is one of the best 3-point-shooting frontcourt players at his level. He hit 40.1% of his triples a season ago. It's the MAC, so the league tournament is far from fair to the top seed, but it's probably rational to expect one of Akron, Ohio or Toledo to wind up winning the conference. With Akron losing too much firepower from a 24-win team and Toledo rebuilding half its roster, Jeff Boals' Bobcats are my pick to emerge as the top squad in a quintessential mid-major league. The Shockers were merely 15-19 a season ago, but it was Paul Mills' first season on the job after doing a wonderful six-year stay with Oral Roberts. Mills brings back five of his top seven minutes-getters, which should convey an above-.500 season. Wichita State figures to get consistent scoring from guards Xavier Bell and Harlond Beverly, who lead a group that's old-old. A lot of teams in this sport are veteran-capped, given this is the final year of the COVID bonus year, but Wichita State's projected starting five will rank near the top in experience. All five are fourth- and fifth-year players, and Mills will have three more battle-scarred seniors readily available off the bench. Projecting WSU as a top-75 team is a dart in the dark, but the program has the players and figures to have the coaching. Beyond that, the American Athletic Conference on average is able to put four teams into the top 75. Let's give 'em a shot. The Red Wolves should supplant James Madison as the premier team in the Sun Belt. Arkansas State was so feared that Memphis and Alabama were the only two schools from high-major and/or multi-bid leagues this past offseason that agreed to play Bryan Hodgson's team. Hodgson, a second-year coach, has done an outstanding job after spending eight years learning under Nate Oats. Three starters return from the program's second 20-win season since 1998. (A young Grant McCasland was responsible for the other one in 2017.) Taryn Todd and Derrian Ford are the notable guys back, but the spark plug should be Louisiana transfer Kobe Julien, who averaged 17+ last season. Craig Smith has gone from 11 wins to 17 to 22 in his first three years in Salt Lake City. The task to get even more in Year 4 will be immense. The Utes lost Branden Carlson to graduation and Deivon Smith to St. John's, which is going to be a big hit, as those were two of the 10 best players in the Pac-12 last season. Now Utah's in the Big 12. It returns Gabe Madsen, the only player back who was a double-digit scorer last season (13.2 ppg). Lawson Lovering and Hunter Erickson are also key returnees. Stretchy San Francisco guard Mike Sharavjamts is poised to be a difference-maker, and Baylor transfer Miro Little should also be featured in the starting lineup. The Pirates narrowly missed last year's NCAAs (then won the NIT) and, even worse, lost Kadary Richmond to Big East rival St. John's. Shaheen Holloway won 17 games in Year 1 and 25 last season. I think he splits that in '24-25 and ends up with either 20 or 21 Ws. Dylan Addae-Wusu and Isaiah Coleman return; expect both to become double-digit scorers after combining to average 14 points last season. Holloway brought on seven transfers, the most notable being an intra-league Big East swap of his own in Garwey Dual (Providence). The implied lack of 3-point prowess is striking. Without enough long-distance threats, it is hard to get the Hall higher on the list than this. That said, while it's casual to underestimate this team, keep in mind Holloway's one of the best do-more-with-less coaches in the high-major ranks. Few folks in the media were as consistently pro-Isaiah Stevens over the past two years as your humble author here. Stevens stuck around in Fort Collins when he easily could have left in 2022 or 2023 and sought bigger NIL paydays. He guided CSU as a point guard with few peers (if any) at his level. Now that his college career is done, the Rams have to hope Northern Iowa transfer Bowen Born can facilitate and guide the ship. It won't be easy, but at least Nique Clifford (a multi-tool 6-5 wing) is back. Clifford figures to be a first team-type of All-Mountain West player. He averaged 12.2 points and that number is a stone-cold lock to inflate. Clifford was a down-transfer from Colorado who is a primo example of how moving to a lower level can vastly improve a player's college experience. Niko Medved also brings back Jalen Lake in a starting role. Probably won't compete for the Mountain West title but should be good enough to flirt with the bubble. I was on hand in Manhattan in March for the Tigers' stunning 90-81 loss in the Ivy League Tournament semifinals to Brown. (Princeton trailed by as many as 22 in that game.) Coach Mitch Henderson was visibly and understandably furious in the aftermath. That aggravation should serve as a motivator, not an inhibitor, for the Tigers in what should be another very good year in Princeton. Last season's team was 24-3 before losing its final two games. Crucially, it returns shooting guard Xaivian Lee, who is the most talented player in the Ivy. But he wasn't the 2024 Ivy POY. That would be Caden Pierce, who is also still wearing black and orange. Those two give the Tigers dependability, leadership and star power. If Henderson enables it, Pierce and Lee could rank among the highest-scoring duos in the country. Both are capable of averaging 20 if they want it. Russell Turner has built up one of the strongest mid-major résumés in the game. With a 289-180 record in 14 seasons, he's finished half of his campaigns with the best team in the Big West. That should be the case again in 2024-25 because the Anteaters have four starters sticking around from a 24-win team that finished 82nd at KenPom. It would come as no shock if this team wound up having a top-50 defense, too. UCI has won on the strength of its bigs in the past, but this group figures to carve its way to another 20-win year based on the depth of its guards. The two starters who should pace this group are Justin Hohn and Andre Henry — a duo that should wind up being the best 3-point shooting backcourt in the Big West. Few coaches have ever had bigger jumps in success in their first three years of Division I coaching than Josh Schertz. His first season at Indiana State was 11-20. Then he went 23-13 in 2022-23. Last season ISU made the NIT title game and went 32-7. If not for an unprecedented amount of bid thieves, the Sycamores would have been in the NCAAs. And Schertz might be coaching at Louisville if they had danced. Instead, Saint Louis is the spot, and it feels right. This is a good jump and the type of hire that SLU fans can eagerly embrace. They've got a shot to once again have a relevant program in short order. A big reason is because Schertz brought MVC Player of the Year Robbie Avila with him. The lovable baller with too many great nicknames (Cream Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Nerd, Steph Blurry) instantly becomes the must-watch player in the A-10. Isaiah Swope (who sank 114 treys a season ago) also made the move down from Indiana State to be a Billiken. Schertz's avant-garde offense combined with some shrewd roster-building provides instant credibility. Eric Musselman won 24 games in his first season at Nevada (2015-16) and 20 in his first at Arkansas (2019-20). Neither team made the NCAAs, and it seems more likely than not that will be true of the Trojans in their first year under Muss and in the West Coast-ified Big Ten. A double-digit transfer load comes aboard, many of them one-year guys in a grad-school year. Led most likely by Desmond Claude (Xavier), it's unclear just how well this group of ballers from Boise State, UMass, UC San Diego, Michigan, Northern Colorado and beyond will jell. Muss is right at home in SoCal, and if it hits, this has a shot to be the one job he sticks at for the better part of a decade. But it's hard to see this assembly as a top-half Big Ten outfit. After regularly rating in the top 100 when Phil Martelli was there, SJU finally broke back into that echelon again by finishing 99th at KenPom last season, Billy Lange's fifth tour. I think the Hawks can be similarly good, if not even slightly better, due to all-Atlantic 10 guard Erik Reynolds II playing one final season on the hill. Reynolds' 17.3 points per game led the league, and teaming up alongside returnee Xzayvier Brown (12.7 ppg) will give the Hawks one of the best backcourt tandems in the A-10. Brown is a stud and could compete with Reynolds for A-10 POY honors. Rasheer Fleming is also back, giving SJU three starting players who stuck around and averaged double digits. That's a luxury few non-high-major programs can claim in 2024. It's a reboot in Fort Worth for Jamie Dixon. The Horned Frogs figure to start four transfers alongside returning center Ernest Udeh Jr. Dixon will also have seven players on the roster yet to play a college game. That's going to lead to piles of losses in the Big 12. Unavoidable. I like the addition of Arizona State transfer Frankie Collins, who will be the head of the snake. He'll be flanked by Noah Reynolds (via Green Bay) and Brendan Wenzel (via Wyoming). TCU is coming off its third straight NCAA appearance, which had never happened in program history. A step or two back in '24-25 is almost certainly coming, but that's no indictment on Dixon's track record. Ben Jacobson has been ping-ponging between good and bad seasons for almost a decade. Here's UNI's win totals, starting in 2016 and up through last season: 23, 14, 16, 16, 25, 10, 20, 14, 19. The Panthers haven't won at least 19 games in back-to-back seasons since their two most recent NCAA Tournament showings in 2015/16. While Bradley is clearly the preseason No. 1 in the MVC, Northern Iowa is a fair pick to finish second — and have its best two-year push since 2016. Well-rounded power wing Tytan Anderson and 6-4 point guard Trey Campbell will guide the way in Cedar Falls. A bizarrely god-awful season (from 25-10 in Dennis Gates' first year to 8-24 last season, including going 0-19 in the SEC) meant Mizzou was one of the most shocking bad teams in the country. There are reasons for belief in a healthy turnaround, though. The Tigers figure to play seven guys in the primary rotation who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players. Wing Tamar Bates (13.5 ppg) returns alongside Caleb Grill, who only played nine games due to injury but should become a double-digit scorer. Duke transfer power forward Mark Mitchell was a crucial portal pickup, as was Iowa's Tony Perkins on the wing. The Tigers will be better built to withstand the rigors of the SEC banked on a vastly improved defense. Gates is too good of a coach to have a terrible team in back-to-back seasons. Fran McCaffery has a good shot at coaching another First Team All-Big Ten player. Payton Sandfort is coming into his fourth season of college ball, having averaged 16.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and shot 37.9% from beyond the arc last season. He's going to be Iowa's No. 1 (and likely No. 2) option on offense as the Hawkeyes look to finish top-20 in offensive efficiency (per KenPom) for an eighth straight season. The defensive concerns are again heavy, which is why I'm predicting a subpar campaign in Iowa City, but if you like the Hawkeyes you should feel great. I don't think there's a team I'm more often wrong about heading into a season than Iowa. Louisville fans aren't looking for a lulu of a season, but they do think Pat Kelsey recruited a roster good enough to go from 12 total wins in two years under Kenny Payne to an NCAA bid in Year 1 of Kelsey. We shall see. As I said on the Eye on College Basketball Podcast last week, Louisville is among the toughest teams to peg in the ACC. Just an outright rebuild emerging from an awful situation. Working in Kelsey's favor: His only season below .500 was his first as a head coach in 2012-13 at Winthrop (14-17). The Cards bring on Chucky Hepburn from Wisconsin, Terrence Edwards Jr. from JMU — who was REALLY good — plus Noah Waterman via BYU, a few guys from Charleston and Kasean Pryor from South Florida. I want to see how the pieces coagulate and I want to see if Kelsey can and does play as up-tempo with U of L as he did with Winthrop and Charleston. James Jones needs four more wins to hit 400 for his career, which should culminate before we get to December. Jones is one of the longest-tenured coaches in Division I; this is his 26th season with the Bulldogs. (It's to Yale's benefit, but this guy should have been hired to a bigger job three-to-eight years ago, frankly.) With Jones still operating in his prime, Yale can be a top-100 team for the fifth time in seven seasons. With Princeton the practical pick to win the Ivy, Yale is the evident No. 2 — and may well win the league's automatic bid again in the intimate and pressurized confines of that league bracket. The Elis lost Danny Wolf to Michigan, otherwise they'd be my preseason pick. Bez Mbeng and John Poulakidas (who had 28 vs. Auburn in the tournament) are back to ball in New Haven, Connecticut. After three consecutive 20-win seasons for a program that's produced a couple of top-20 NBA picks (Jalen Williams, Brandin Podziemski) as of late, let's toss them into the 100 And 1. Herb Sendek has a really good staff and didn't lose anyone to the portal (less than 10 teams did in all of college hoops) and should have nine guys playing double-digit minutes, which is why I've got the Broncos positioned to finish in the top four of the WCC. You best believe that Adama-Alpha Bal (a top-10 name in the sport) is ready for his senior year close-up. He'll team up with Johnny O'Neil, who is a jack-of-all-trades type … at 6-10. The top four of the WCC looks good again. It's a shame that the league is losing Gonzaga in two years, but that will help programs like Santa Clara break through after the breakup. Alan Huss had one of the best debut coaching seasons Division I has seen — regardless of conference designation — in recent memory. He took over the Panthers last season and transformed a school that averaged 13 wins over the previous seven seasons into a 27-9 inaugural campaign. Unfortunately for High Point, it got picked off in the Big South Tournament against Longwood, losing a heartbreaker by one in OT. Now Huss gets four starters back, including potential Big South POY Kezza Giffa and second-year defensive standout Juslin Bodo Bodo. The Gamecocks lost three of their top four scorers, who accounted for nearly 38 points per game, but do bring back one of the best sophomores in the country. Collin Murray-Boyles may sound like the name of the second-best striker for Ireland's World Cup team, but no. He's a 6-7 forward who has a great opportunity to step into the spotlight and be one of the five best players in the SEC. The lack of proven pieces around Murray-Boyles has me hesitant overall on the Gamecocks, who were one of the surprises of 2023-24 after winning 26 games and earning a No. 6 seed despite being picked dead last in the then-14-team SEC. The Hokies — and a few teams like them — will be interesting test cases for predictive metrics in this new phase of 16- and 18-team megaconferences. If a team like this goes 18-16 and finishes four games below .500 in league play, will it still work its way into the top 75? Glancing at VT's roster, you can make a case for not including this team in the top 101. But I will because Mike Young's a really good coach and should squeeze a lot out of his roster. Young is 92-66 in five seasons in Blacksburg, holding a 50-52 mark against ACC opponents. Virginia Tech brings aboard Charleston's Ben Burnham and Temple's Hysier Miller as its biggest stat guys in the portal. The attrition is huge; no ACC team that didn't undergo a coaching change lost a bigger dose of its roster than the Hokies. This one's admittedly a hunch based on little evidence. But guess what? Teams make huge jumps from well outside the top 100 every year. It's part of the fun of watching the season unfold. We've got two years until the Pac-12 revives. During its interregnum, Oregon State (and Washington State) are taking up residency in the WCC. I think the move will do wonders for Wayne Tinkle's program. Plus, the Beavers are loaded with guys between 6-7 and 7 feet. As Dan Patrick once said: Welcome to the Big Show. Can't wait to see how this roster-building approach fares in a mid-major league. The WCC schedule is now 18 games, with a home-and-home against Gonzaga guaranteed. Get this: Oregon State is 25-2 vs. Gonzaga, and 11-0 since Gonzaga went Division I in the early 1960s. The teams last met in 1991! Putting faith in a remarkable second-year spike for Georgetown under Ed Cooley. No. 90 doesn't get you anywhere near the NCAA tourney convo obviously, but I'll take a flier on Georgetown hitting 15 wins, upgrading its defense and beating at least three non-DePaul teams in the Big East. Malik Mack could be the star. The Harvard transfer is likely to be a high-volume producer alongside junior guard Jayden Epps. The addition of TCU forward Micah Peavy should provide G'town a necessary older-guy presence on a team that's got a lot of freshmen. What a story. Bucky McMillan, who grew up four miles from Samford and has lived his whole life in Birmingham, Alabama, took his BuckyBall style to its maximum potential (seemingly) by going from six wins in Year 1 to 29 and an NCAA Tournament berth in Year 4. Samford was 81st at KenPom last season after falling to Kansas in controversial fashion in the first round of the Big Dance. McMillan lost four starters, but I'd bank on this team being able to average north of 77 or 78 points (last year: 81.4) because of the style of play. Rylan Jones is the lone returning starter on a team that's projected to be the best in the SoCon. A lot of players are going to have an increase in minutes and impact. McMillan's press-for-40-minutes-no-matter-what blueprint is the only one of its kind in college basketball. Here are the teams outside the high-major leagues with the most wins over the last eight seasons: Gonzaga (121), Belmont (120) and Vermont (115). John Becker has made the NCAAs six times; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Related: UVM has ranked top-100 at KenPom six times in Becker's tenure; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Becker should be taking calls from dozens of coaches across the country so they can learn his secret for avoiding invariable pitfalls that affect most other mid-majors. Four starters are back from a No. 13 seed that went 28-7. Shamir Bogues seems to be the next big name in the Green Mountain State, but beyond individual play, Becker believes this team could be one of his best on defense. The Tigers have a chance to be the surprise mid-major team in the sport. Pat Skerry's team lost just two hoopers from last year's lineup that won 20 games (and they were to graduation and a down-transfer to D-II). In total, 10 out of 11 possible returnees are back. Understand: This kind of retention scenario will present itself maybe two or three times at the non-military mid-major level moving forward. A really good story is brewing here. Four players returned who averaged double figures, led by Christian May and Dylan Williamson. In total, 81% of the team's scoring returns and Skerry probably will go 10-deep well into league play. To me, the narrow favorites over Charleston in a competitive top end of the CAA. I dithered between FAU or UNT as the last team from the American in the back of the Top 100 And 1. I'll lean Mean Green due to not having a coaching change and the program ranking top-90 in multiple metrics four years running. Due to losing four starters, the Mean Green probably take a step back, but Ross Hodge's defensive scheme is going to ensure this team is second tier at worst in the AAC. Hodge is a top-10 (maybe top-five) defensive coach in the country. But without a threatening scorer, things get problematic. I think the name to watch is Atin Wright, a transfer from Drake who can shoot from deep and is going to be North Texas' spreader on offense. It's easy to overlook a team that wins by committee the way UNT has in recent years, but until I see results that justify putting this program outside the top 101, I won't do it. The Nittany Lions have five seniors back. Ace Baldwin is probably going to destroy opposing guards' spirits with almost every assignment he gets. That guy is worth the price of admission. No, PSU doesn't have great basketball history, but Mike Rhoades' track record (389-206 in his career, including a decade in D-III) suggests this team is being underrated heading into the season. Again, the Big Ten is such a foggy set of circumstances, but something tells me Rhoades' team will play spoiler on multiple nights this season. Over the past 20 years, with only a few exceptions, the MVC has placed at least three teams in the top 100 of a variety of metrics by season's end. I think 2025 will sustain the pattern. I've got Bradley in the top 50, Northern Iowa 16 spots north of this, and now we welcome the Murray State Racers back into the top-100 club. The team is one of my picks for one of the biggest turnarounds in the sport. Steve Prohm's program won only 12 games last season. So, why so much faith? Eight juniors and seniors will take up the entirety of the rotation, with a reasonable expectation that this will be a top-two defense in the Valley. At the 1 is JaCobi Wood, who won't exactly be Ja Morant, but I think he's poised to be one of only a handful of guys in D-I to average 15/5/5. If it all comes together, he could do that and creep up on 40% shooting from 3-point range. It would be easy to dismiss OSU after a lackluster run at the end of Mike Boynton's tenure, a subsequent coaching hire and inevitable massive roster flip. But the new coach is Steve Lutz, who has made the past three NCAA tourneys while at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Western Kentucky. He's a really good coach and previously worked under Matt Painter at Purdue and Greg McDermott at Creighton. Most importantly, Lutz wound up recruiting one of the oldest rosters in high-major ball, which I expect to translate to a solid Year 1. The familiar name is Bryce Thompson, who opted to stick it out in Stillwater after Boynton's departure. The new name is Devo Davis, who can be hit-or-miss but needs to hit big to give the Cowboys a spoiler's chance in the 16-team Big 12. The Buffaloes are losing a lot. The most talented team in program history, essentially. Gone: Tristan da Silva, KJ Simpson, Cody Williams, all NBA picks, two of them first rounders. And Eddie Lampkin Jr. is gone as well. Tad Boyle's had some really good years with lowered expectations. Let's see if he can pull off another one here, because it looks to be a tough slog ahead as Colorado transitions into the Big 12. It's anyone's guess as to who steps up in a starring role, but the candidates are Washington State transfer Andrej Jakimovski and top returning reserve Julian Hammond III. On a side note, I'm not sure there's a greater personality disparity in coaches at the high-major level than Deion Sanders and Tad Boyle. Frank Martin won 15 games in Year 1, 20 last season, so why not sign up for the Minutemen to be near the top of the A-10? It's an ambitious forecast, but Martin's force of will tends to have his rosters outperform expectations. Simply put, there will be 10-15 teams that easily rank top-100 come March but that can't be found inside the preseason top 100 at any predictive metrics site today. I'll go with UMass as one of those teams. Shooting guard Rahsool Diggins is back; expect him to drop 15 points per night. Sophomore point guard Jaylen Curry should shine. This is UMass' final season in the A-10, by the way. The school idiotically voted to leave and chase ill-fated football dreams in the MAC starting in 2025, a decision that's alienated a heavy portion of the school's alumni base. It's fair to say Bobby Hurley is in a hot-seat season, due to the new-look Big 12 and the fact ASU has finished sub-.500 in three of the past four years. If 2025 doesn't include an NCAA bid, change could be in the offing. And so, in comes the highest-rated frosh class of Hurley's career. One of the surprise roster additions of the offseason was ASU landing five-star Jayden Quaintance, who could help prove this ranking too dismissive. Best of all, due to his age, he's not eligible to be drafted until 2026. It's not just Quaintance; ASU also got a football-style flip in Joson Sanon, who balked on his commitment to Arizona and took to Tempe. I've got the Sun Devils low, however, because relying on freshmen and portal adds from the mid-major ranks (Missouri State's Alston Mason and Milwaukee's BJ Freeman are expected to be prominently featured) could be a challenging playbook in the best league in the country. The Cornhuskers are coming off only their second NCAA Tournament bid since 1998. This was a sweet story last season, but the bounce-back could be difficult. Keisei Tominaga's off conquering the world these days; the sport will miss him so. Critically, Rienk Mast is out for the season because of a knee injury. That lowers NU's ceiling due to Mast's vastly underrated skillset. Look for returnees Brice Williams and Juwan Gary to be high-leverage, positionless-type players, though maximizing their success could be attached to Utah transfer point guard Rollie Worster, who missed much of last season to injury. So there's your widespread preview. Want more hoops previews? We've got a lot in stock already. To start, head here for our preseason All-America teams and our preseason awards. If you want even more detailed previews of the high-major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12 and the SEC) and a best-of-the-rest lookahead outside the power leagues. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Title: From Tariffs to Taxes to Tyranny, Hollywood Braces for the Possibility of a Donald Trump Victory

Director Ali Abbasi basked in the applause, confident that the eight-minute standing ovation “The Apprentice” was enjoying in Cannes last May meant that his six-year gamble to bring the film to the screen was about to pay off. The movie, a look at Donald Trump’s early years as a real estate developer and his friendship with Roy Cohn, was scouting for distribution. Armed with this kind of reception, Abbasi believed he would soon have Netflix, or one of the prominent indie studios, knocking on his door. But though “The Apprentice” drew interest from the usual suspects, there were no offers — not even a lowball one. The film, which depicts Trump getting liposuction, abusing amphetamines, running his casino into the ground and raping his first wife, Ivana, was simply too hot to handle. With Trump locked in a tight race for the White House, major studios, indie labels and streamers, or at least their corporate parents, couldn’t risk alienating the once and possibly future king. Related Stories VIP+ How YouTube and Netflix Copied Each Other’s Homework 'A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead' Video Game Will Measure How Loud You Are With Your Controller's Microphone “I get it,” Abbasi says. “This guy can become the next president, and he will have all these tools at his disposal, which he’s shown a willingness to use. So he can come after you with all these regulations and taxes.” he adds, “But it still upsets me.” Popular on Variety Abbasi’s experience says a lot about the anxiety gripping the entertainment world as it watches a tumultuous, enormously consequential election unfold. From corporate suites to studio lots, Hollywood is bracing for a possible Trump return, one that could bring chaos and deepen political divisions in a polarized country. “There’s a lot of nervousness,” says Schuyler M. Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker, who practices entertainment, corporate and tax law. “They don’t know exactly what he would do if he got back in power.” The actors, writers and directors who make most of what Hollywood exports are overwhelmingly supportive of Kamala Harris and view Trump as an existential threat to their freedoms. They speak at rallies for the Democratic nominee, host fundraisers and make personal contributions. And they’re terrified about what Trump would mean for everything from abortion access to environmental protections — to say nothing of the frontal assault on the rule of law he seems hell-bent on waging. “Everything’s at stake,” says Sarah Paulson, the Emmy- and Tony-winning actress and a Harris supporter. “Democracy is on the ballot.” But the people who sign Paulson and other artists’ checks have complicated loyalties — they seem more worried about making money than maintaining democratic norms. For them, a second Trump term would mean lower taxes and less antitrust enforcement, a key attraction for a debt-ridden industry looking to consolidate. They are banking on Trump behaving like a generic Republican by embracing a pro-business agenda. But Trump has been less interested in ideology and more attracted to a politics of personal grievance, one that rewards sycophants and punishes critics. Trump’s erratic behavior in his first term made it difficult for companies to figure out how to navigate his administration without offending him. Despite that challenge, his policies were often good for corporate bottom lines. In 2017, Trump signed a massive tax cut, lowering corporate rates from 35% to 21%. The bill included benefits that were especially helpful to Hollywood, including a lowered rate on overseas income and the ability to immediately write off the full cost of film and TV productions. Disney and Comcast each saved more than $6 billion in the following four years, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. If elected to a second term, Trump has vowed to cut the corporate rate even further — to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S. Harris, in contrast, wants to hike the rate to 28% and increase the tax on overseas income. Regardless of who wins, the Motion Picture Association, which represents seven Hollywood studios, is already seeking to influence the next tax law. In a Sept. 25 letter, the lobbying group urged Congress to preserve the benefits of the Trump tax cut, arguing that it “led to a profound increase in film and television production and ownership in the U.S.” On the other hand, Trump has targeted companies that own news operations, sometimes in performative ways, but sometimes with genuine consequences. In the last month, he has threatened to pull the broadcast licenses of CBS and Disney’s ABC over their coverage, and he is currently suing ABC. He has threatened to investigate Comcast for “treason” over NBC’s coverage of the Russia scandal. And in 2017, his Justice Department sued to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, which some saw as retaliation against CNN for its coverage of his campaign and presidency. Looking ahead, Trump has pledged to use his office to prosecute opponents. Since many media conglomerates operate news divisions and produce late-night shows that investigate, criticize or lampoon Trump, that could make them a legal and political target for a president obsessed with personal retribution. “I could see him asking Republicans to pass a law saying anything anti-government is treasonous,” says Moore. “And I could also see him trying to upend current defamation law, so it becomes much easier to go after people. That could have a chilling effect on free speech.” Moore faults companies for being too enamored of the tax cuts that Trump is proposing and insufficiently fearful of his authoritarian impulses. “He’s not kidding around,” he says. “I’m not sure how great it would be for them to live in a country without a functional democracy.” Those darker predictions may not come to pass, but whoever wins the Oval Office will have to deal with a media industry that’s desperate to keep merging. And since the next president’s administration will be tasked with enforcing antitrust law, that will give either Trump or Harris enormous power over Hollywood’s future. The Biden administration has antagonized Wall Street by appointing enforcers — Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, anti-trust division chief at the Justice Department — who have targeted corporate power, especially in tech. Critics argue that has had a chilling effect. “They created an environment that made dealmaking more difficult,” says Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. “They’ve scared away deals.” It’s not obvious which administration would be better for companies. Kovacic assumes that Trump would back off on the Biden approach, though he adds, “if you’re a company he hates, he’s not beyond revenge.” Harris, meanwhile, sued several companies on antitrust grounds when she was California attorney general. But she was reluctant to take big swings at the tech industry, according to a memoir by Kathleen Foote, the longtime chief of the AG’s antitrust section. Kovacic says Harris might go a little easier than Biden, but in a subtle way, so as not to rile her left flank. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren recently urged the Justice Department to scrutinize Venu, the new sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, saying it would raise subscription prices across the industry. If Harris is elected, Sanders and Warren are likely to keep up the pressure on her administration on that and similar issues. Warner Bros. Discovery is struggling under a massive debt load, and another merger may be its only means of survival. At the Allen & Co. conference in July, CEO David Zaslav didn’t endorse a candidate, but said he hoped the next administration will see the benefits of consolidation. “We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to, to be even better,” he said. The Hollywood unions have supported the Biden approach, arguing that media consolidation suppresses wages and results in layoffs. “The Biden administration has been the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” says Matthew Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 65,000 Hollywood workers and has endorsed Harris. “It was an easy call for us,” Loeb says. Entertainment companies also face the risk of an all-out trade war. Hollywood is an export business, but many studios belong to companies such as Sony and Apple that also import electronics and other goods to the U.S. Trump has promised a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on goods coming from China. That would unleash “chaos” in a global marketplace, says Ed Brzytwa, the VP of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. “All the agreements, rules and norms will start to unravel,” he says. Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, most of which Biden retained. They amounted to a $32 billion levy on electronic goods through 2021, according to Brzytwa’s group. The Consumer Technology Association — whose members include Sony, Disney, Amazon and Comcast — argues that the tariffs failed to revive U.S. manufacturing, but did push production to other Asian countries, like Vietnam and Taiwan. In 2022, Sony Electronics moved much of its camera production to Thailand. Harris would likely maintain the Biden approach, using targeted tariffs more aggressively than under previous Democratic administrations. Trump’s overall tariff rates would be seven times higher than the current level, according to the Tax Foundation. If he follows through, prices would rise, and the resulting drop in demand, for many companies, would outweigh any gains from lower tax rates, Brzytwa says. “I think there is a lot of interest in the corporate world in preserving what was accomplished in the [Trump tax bill],” he says. “But they don’t want a situation where the U.S. is a fortress and is closed off from the world.” Brzytwa warns that other countries would likely retaliate, making life more difficult for exporters — even entertainment producers. Media giants shoot all over the world, taking advantage of foreign subsidies. They employ creative talent overseas, and release movies and television shows to vast international regions, where they hope to drive future growth. Trump’s protectionist policies could disrupt that. They would threaten to reframe America’s role in the global economy, straining alliances and fracturing trade partnerships. The consequences of those actions would be felt in almost every sector of the economy. “You have someone in Trump with the potential to blow it all up,” says Tina Fordham, the founder of Fordham Global Foresight and an expert on geopolitical risk. “If the rules of the game and international norms aren’t respected, then the U.S. will no longer be treated as a reliable global trading partner. That means all the advantages that America has enjoyed in the post-World War II era could erode. I’m not sure people appreciate how destabilizing this could be.” Some of that impact is already being felt. A decade ago, Hollywood was still focused on opening the Chinese market to American films. But that initiative faded away as the relationship soured. “That ship has sailed,” says Greg Frazier, who worked on the issue while at the MPA. “Whether it’s Harris or Trump, I don’t see any great opening in China, on either side.” As for “The Apprentice,” after months in limbo, the producers finally signed a deal with Briarcliff Entertainment, a tiny distribution company that has handled politically charged fare such as “The Dissident,” a 2020 documentary about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi that also scared off major media outlets. “It was such a relief to get into theaters,” Abbasi says. “I spent the summer clinically depressed and thinking, ‘We did all this work, and nobody is ever going to see our film.’” Instead, “The Apprentice” opened in theaters on Oct. 11, a month before a presidential election that could return Trump to the pinnacle of power. Abbasi is glad that someone had the courage to release his movie, but he won’t forget the fear he encountered while trying to get “The Apprentice” in front of audiences. “The big story for me is how one human being is intimidating the 300 million or so people who live in America,” Abbasi says. “How can an entire country let that happen?” Jack Dunn contributed to this report.

On Thursday, JPMorgan reaffirmed its Overweight rating on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), following the company's third-quarter earnings report, which surpassed expectations. The semiconductor giant reported gross margins (GM) of 57.8%, significantly higher than the anticipated mid-point guidance of 54.5% and JPMorgan's estimate of 54.8%. Moreover, TSMC provided an optimistic fourth-quarter revenue growth forecast of 13% quarter over quarter, indicating a potential further increase in gross margins. The improvement in gross margins for the second half of 2024 is attributed to better utilization rates, with N5 and N3 technology nodes operating at full capacity, and productivity gains. These positive factors have helped mitigate the challenges posed by the transition from N5 to N3 technology and increases in power tariffs. TSMC also projects that the growth in artificial intelligence (AI) will sustain for several years, driven by robust demand from hyperscaler customers and the development of practical applications. This outlook suggests the likelihood of an ongoing semiconductor industry upcycle. JPMorgan's analysis points to a potential near-term rise in TSMC's stock value, particularly in light of the company's strong guidance and margin trajectory. This outlook comes as a reassurance to investors, especially after recent concerns about potential weaknesses in the semiconductor sector following disappointing news from ASML (AS:ASML). In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) reported robust third-quarter sales, surpassing both their own and market estimates. This success is attributed to the strong performance of TSMC's advanced nodes, particularly as the 3nm technology continues to gain traction. HSBC, BofA Securities, and Bernstein SocGen Group have all maintained positive ratings on TSMC, highlighting the company's strong financial performance and future potential. TSMC's revenue reached TWD760 billion, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter. The semiconductor giant is expected to achieve a gross margin of 55.5% for the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of 54.7%. The precise details regarding the company's financial performance will be clarified during TSMC's third-quarter earnings call. TSMC displayed robust performance in Q2 of 2024, with a 13.6% sequential revenue increase and a gross margin rise to 53.2%. The High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for 52% of total revenue. Furthermore, TSMC raised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. The company's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. These are among the recent developments for TSMC as the company continues to solidify its position in the semiconductor industry. The company's advanced technologies and strategic investments have been recognized by several analyst firms, highlighting its potential for continued growth and success. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, aligning with JPMorgan's optimistic outlook. According to InvestingPro data, TSM's revenue growth has been impressive, with a 40.07% increase in the most recent quarter. This robust growth supports the company's positive fourth-quarter forecast mentioned in the article. The company's profitability metrics are equally noteworthy. TSM boasts a healthy gross profit margin of 53.36% for the last twelve months, which is consistent with the strong gross margins reported in the third quarter. Moreover, the operating income margin stands at a remarkable 42.04%, indicating efficient operations and cost management. InvestingPro Tips highlight TSM's strong dividend performance, with a dividend growth of 42.34% over the last twelve months. This substantial increase in dividends reflects the company's financial health and commitment to shareholder returns, which may be particularly appealing to investors in the current market environment. For readers interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 20 additional tips for TSM, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial position and market performance.

We recently published a list of 12 Most Profitable Growth Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stands against other most profitable growth stocks to invest in. After the September inflation report, the market did feel a slight bit of panic but it seems to be fading away. After the report, the market expectations for a rate cut shifted, with 79.9% of participants predicting a cut to 450-475 basis points, while 20.1% expect the rates to remain unchanged. It was a change from 32.1% expecting a 50 bps rate cut and 67.9% anticipating a 25 bps cut at the beginning of the month as mentioned in our 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest in article. However, on October 11, the CME FedWatch tool showed that 89.5% of the market now expects a 25 bps rate cut and the rest expect it to remain the same. Christian Mueller-Glissmann from Goldman Sachs joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the latest market trends. He believes that the stock market pullback in August could be a warning of more potential corrections, but he does not see a severe bear market ahead. His overall outlook is positive due to a healthy macroeconomic environment, where growth remains stable, inflation is under control, and central banks are starting to reduce rates. These factors create a favorable setting for equities and other risk assets. He pointed out that while bullish market positioning contributed to August’s setback, the combination of declining inflation and rate cuts allows central banks to cushion against financial shocks, minimizing the risk of a deep downturn. Mueller-Glissmann highlighted two key reasons for not expecting a major market decline: inflation has significantly dropped, giving central banks more flexibility, and price momentum over the past 6-12 months suggests a strong macroeconomic backdrop. With the labor market improving, he sees no signs of an economic downturn. His strategy focuses on quality growth stocks that are temporarily undervalued and cyclical value stocks that could recover as the market stabilizes. Regarding inflation, he noted a shift from inflation relief to growth as the main market driver, raising concerns about inflation resurfacing if growth strengthens. However, he remains confident that inflation will stay anchored, and disinflation will continue into the year’s end.

Title: A billionaire investor sold his Nvidia shares. It was a 'big mistake', he says

Time Published: 2024-10-17T12:50:00Z

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller admits he has made more than a few mistakes in his career. Selling his Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%) shares earlier this year was one of them. In an interview with Bloomberg TV Wednesday, Druckenmiller said he sold all of his Nvidia holdings when the stock was priced somewhere between $800 and $950. “It was a big mistake,” Druckenmiller, chief executive of Duquesne Family Office, said. Nvidia carried out a 10-for-1 stock split in June, when its shares were near a then-record of $1,200 apiece. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company were up 3% in pre-market trading as of Thursday morning, set to open at $139.82 each. Despite some volatility, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 180% so far this year — and is on track to reach another record high this week. The chip giant now has a market capitalization of $3.33 trillion, the second-largest in the world behind Apple (AAPL+0.64%). While the investor had hoped to hold onto his shares of the chipmaker “for years,” Druckenmiller thought the valuation was rich after the stock tripled in a year. “I think Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down we’d get involved again,” Druckenmiller said. “But right now, I’m licking my wounds from a bad sale there.” Druckenmiller said that despite the pullback from Nvidia, he remains optimistic about artificial intelligence. He said his investment firm is eyeing other ways to keep his foot in the door in the booming sector. The investor has a net worth of $9.98 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. While Nvidia isn’t set to report its latest quarterly earnings until late November, Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+0.52%) (TSMC) strong results Thursday have helped fuel confidence that the AI boom could extend into next year and beyond. Earlier this month, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for its highly-anticipated Blackwell chip is “insane.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

On Thursday, Mizuho Securities sustained its positive stance on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), lifting its price target to $650 from the previous $600 while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes as the firm's checks on advertising spending reveal performance surpassing the consensus and reaching the higher end of the company's guidance, which anticipates a 20% year-over-year growth. The analyst at Mizuho highlighted the additional revenue potential stemming from political advertising. Despite the expectation that capital expenditures (capex) might rise following the second-quarter guidance of a 37% year-over-year increase, it was noted that Meta has operational expenditure (opex) flexibility that could balance the heightened depreciation costs. In justification of the new price target, Mizuho increased its target multiple for Meta's fiscal year 2026 enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA) to 13 times, up from 12 times. This adjustment reflects the high end of the stock's historical range. The analyst expressed confidence in Meta's ability to outperform expectations, suggesting that it could surpass forecasts and raise future guidance, citing significant potential in its messaging services and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) for creative purposes. The analyst's remarks also touched on the current market sentiment, describing Meta's stock as a "crowded trade into the print." This suggests that many investors may be anticipating positive results. Nonetheless, the analyst's outlook implies that Meta stands out among major tech companies for its potential to exceed expectations and offer promising developments in technology. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has initiated strategic adjustments impacting Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs teams. The company has been streamlining teams to align with long-term goals and location strategy, with some employees being relocated and others reassigned. Meta has also been facing legal challenges, with a federal judge ordering the company to confront lawsuits alleging that its social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. Meanwhile, several financial firms have offered positive outlooks on Meta's future. Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta, suggesting continued aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. Stifel raised its price target for Meta to $663, citing strong momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Roth/MKM also raised the stock's price target to $620, reflecting optimism in the company's medium and long-term prospects. Finally, Meta has made strides in combating disinformation, dismantling a network of fake accounts targeting users in Moldova ahead of the country's presidential election and EU membership referendum. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms. Meta Platforms Inc.'s strong financial position and market performance align well with Mizuho Securities' bullish outlook. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a market capitalization of $1.46 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the tech sector. The company's impressive revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months supports Mizuho's expectation of continued strong performance. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's financial strength, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and has "liquid assets exceed short term obligations." These factors contribute to Meta's financial flexibility, which could be crucial as the company navigates potential increases in capital expenditures, as mentioned in the Mizuho analysis. Furthermore, Meta's "impressive gross profit margins" of 81.49% underscore its operational efficiency, potentially allowing for the opex flexibility that Mizuho suggests could offset higher depreciation costs. The company's strong profitability is further evidenced by its high return on assets of 23.54%. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for Meta Platforms Inc., providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: ‘I guarantee it’: Donald Trump vows no state in America will be allowed to ban gas-powered cars

Time Published: 2024-10-17T12:04:00Z

In recent years, electric vehicles have gained significant traction in the U.S. And several states are moving to accelerate the transition by planning bans on the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles in the near future. California was the first state to adopt the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which dictates that, “by 2035 all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California will be zero emissions.” Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized the urgency, stating that cars “shouldn’t melt glaciers or raise sea levels.” Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how But California isn’t standing alone. So far, 11 other states have followed suit, setting their sights on phasing out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. However, this sweeping shift doesn’t sit well with former President Donald Trump. Speaking at a rally in Saginaw, Michigan, the Republican presidential nominee declared, “When I'm president, no state in America will be permitted to ban gas powered cars or trucks, and I guarantee it — no way, no way. You're going to make them right here.” The crowd erupted in cheers. Despite the growing buzz around EVs, they still represent a relatively small piece of the U.S. auto market. Kelley Blue Book estimated that in 2023, the EV share of the total U.S. vehicle market was 7.6%. If Trump wins the election and succeeds in halting state-level bans on gas-powered cars, the automotive landscape could shift dramatically. Here’s a look at three stocks that could benefit from this potential move — stocks that Wall Street already finds attractive. Ford has been making headlines with its push toward electrification, rolling out models like the Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric SUV, and the F-150 Lightning, an electric version of its iconic pickup truck. However, the company’s core business remains tied to traditional combustion engines. In 2023, Ford says it sold 1,995,912 vehicles, but only 72,608 were EVs. Financially, the EV segment has been a challenge. According to a report in Bloomberg, Ford’s losses per electric vehicle exceeded $100,000 in the first quarter of 2024, prompting the company to cut battery supplier orders. To recalibrate, Ford is pivoting production at its Oakville, Ontario plant. Originally slated for electric SUV production, the plant will be prioritizing its high-demand F-Series Super Duty trucks. If Trump prevents states from banning gas-powered cars, Ford could continue thriving in the truck and SUV market, especially given the F-Series status as America’s best-selling vehicle. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney has a “buy” rating on Ford and a price target of $13, implying a potential upside of 20%. Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead General Motors, like Ford, has heavily invested in EVs while still leaning on its profitable lineup of gas-powered cars, SUVs and trucks, including popular models like the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. In June, GM reportedly announced plans to scale back its EV production target for 2024, reducing expectations to between 200,000 and 250,000 vehicles, down from a previous estimate of up to 300,000. At its recent investor day, GM projected it would close the year producing “about 200,000” EVs, at the low end of its revised guidance. Meanwhile, the company has said it expects operating losses in its EV segment to shrink by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025. GM sold 75,883 EVs last year — only 2.9% of the company’s total sales. CNBC noted that “a vast majority of those” of those sales came from GM's now-discontinued Chevrolet Bolt models. If Trump’s proposed policies slow the shift to EVs, GM could continue to capitalize on its established and profitable gas-powered lineups. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an “outperform” rating on GM and a price target of $55 — 13% above where the stock sits today. Exxon Mobil is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. It’s also a familiar name to drivers of gasoline-powered vehicles, with more than 11,000 gas stations across the U.S. Business is highly lucrative. In 2023, the company generated $36.0 billion in profits and $55.4 billion in cash flow from operating activities. The company’s profitability translates to strong shareholder returns. In 2023, Exxon returned $32.4 billion to investors, including $14.9 billion in dividends and $17.4 billion in stock buybacks. With its entrenched position in traditional energy, Exxon stands to benefit if gas-powered cars continue to dominate American roads. A policy preventing states from banning gasoline vehicles could sustain fuel demand, allowing Exxon to leverage its vast infrastructure and extensive oil reserves. Exxon shares have already surged 18% in 2024, and UBS analyst Josh Silverstein sees further upside on the horizon. Silverstein has a “Buy” rating on Exxon and a price target of $149 — roughly 24% above the current levels.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.52%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.51%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” said Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Huang had previously said that the company expected smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. Looking ahead, TSMC chief C.C. Wei has said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. Wedbush analysts say the company could keep riding this high for a long while. In a note Thursday titled “No End in Sight to AI Derived Strength,” analysts, led by Matt Bryson, said the third-quarter results give more confidence to views that TSMC will be able to continue growing gross margins. TSMC’s gross margins were 58% for the quarter. The analysts expect AI chip revenues to more than triple in 2024 and account for around a mid-teens percentage of TSMC’s revenues. For the fourth quarter, TSMC estimates that its revenue will come in between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion — a multi-billion dollar increase from last quarter. It’s projecting gross profit margin of 57.0% to 59.0%, consistent with the third quarter or slightly higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

"Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

U.S.-listed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares jumped 9% Thursday morning after the chipmaker posted robust quarterly earnings and projected a buoyant outlook on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported a 54% year-over-year rise in third-quarter net income of 325.26 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion), up from NT$211 billion. The profit figure by the world's largest contract chip manufacturer beat the NT$300.78 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. TSMC also reported a 39% jump in revenue to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion) for the quarter and a 57.8% gross margin, above analysts' estimates and the guidance it gave for both in the second quarter. "Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies," TSMC Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Wendell Huang said. "Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies." TSMC's upbeat earnings, in contrast to Dutch semiconductor-gear manufacturer ASML Holding's (ASML) downbeat outlook earlier in the week, restored investor faith in the AI boom Thursday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all rose. TSMC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei called the demand for AI “real" in the earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. TSMC American depositary receipts (ADRs) have almost doubled this year.UPDATE—Oct. 17, 2024: This article has been updated to include a comment from the CEO and a refreshed share price.

Techs led US stocks higher on Thursday as TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook eased worries about AI chip demand, with the next batch of earnings on deck. Strong retail sales data also helped lift the major averages. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flatline to hold near record highs after the major averages rebounded to close with gains. Contract chipmaker TSMC posted a 54% jump in quarterly profit to beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forecast for 2024 revenue growth amid surging AI demand. The outlook boost from the main chipmaker for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) reassured a market spooked by ASML's (ASML) downbeat sales forecast, reviving hopes for an AI boom. TSMC's US-listed shares climbed 8%, poised to cross a $1 trillion market valuation if the gains hold in the regular session. Its forecast helped spur a rally chip stocks including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia. On the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000. The data released Thursday morning was watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November. After a stellar showing by big banks, the focus is now on Big Tech earnings to wipe away the disappointments of the last quarter. After the bell, Netflix becomes the first "Magnificent Seven" megacap to report, with Wall Street on watch for price-hike news to potentially lift the stock. The major averages rose on Thursday with tech stocks leading the gains after chipmaker TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook helped send the semiconductor sector higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Strong economic data also helped lift stocks. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% — a sharp increase from August's 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% — a sharp acceleration off August's 0.1% growth. Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. The prior week's reading was revised up to 260,000. The data released Thursday morning gives fuel to the argument that the economy could be reaccelerating following a strong September jobs report. Investors were watching the data for clues on what the Federal Reserve's interest rate move will be at the next FOMC meeting in November. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) surged 9.6% in premarket trading, putting the stock in position for an all-time high after its third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates. TSMC recorded a 54% jump in profit and raised its full-year revenue outlook. TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia (NVDA) and its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as well as Broadcom (AVGO) and many other tech firms. Nvidia shares jumped 3%, AMD rose 2.7%, and Broadcom jumped 2.8% premarket on the news. Here's a look at TSMC's results: Adjusted earnings per share of 12.54 New Taiwan dollars ($0.39) versus NT$11.55 ($0.36) expected Revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.5 billion) versus NT$751.1 billion ($23.3 billion) expected The chip stocks' rally partially reverses the sector's losses earlier this week, driven by fears over potential further US trade restrictions and a gloomy report from semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. Analysts at Needham, Bernstein, Barclays, and other investment firms reiterated their buy ratings on TSM stock on Thursday morning. Of the Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the company, some 23 recommend buying the stock, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. On average, analysts see shares rising to about $217 each over the next 12 months, per Bloomberg data.

3Q 2024 operating revenue of $44.7 billion3Q 2024 adjusted operating gain1 of $2.4 billion3Q 2024 diluted EPS2 of $4.36; adjusted diluted EPS1 of $8.374Q 2024 dividend of $1.63 per share declared to shareholders INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00.1.Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures.2.Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2$1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3$2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin13.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,35.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.2.Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation."3.Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein.Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1$1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin14.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1$0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin15.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Basis of PresentationOperating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.Elevance HealthEarnings Release Financial Schedules and Supplementary InformationQuarter & Year-to-Date Ended September 30, 2024Membership and Other MetricsQuarterly & Year-to-Date Consolidated Statements of IncomeCondensed Consolidated Balance SheetCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsSupplemental Financial Information - Reportable SegmentsSupplemental Financial Information - Reconciliation of Medical Claims PayableReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresElevance HealthMembership and Other Metrics(Unaudited) Change fromMedical Membership (in thousands)September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024Individual1,299 999 1,281 30.0 % 1.4 %Employer Group Risk-Based3,672 3,754 3,648 (2.2) % 0.7 %Commercial Risk-Based4,971 4,753 4,929 4.6 % 0.9 %BlueCard ®16,677 6,737 6,692 (0.9) % (0.2) %Employer Group Fee-Based20,589 20,166 20,542 2.1 % 0.2 %Commercial Fee-Based27,266 26,903 27,234 1.3 % 0.1 %Medicare Advantage2,047 2,064 2,031 (0.8) % 0.8 %Medicare Supplement894 928 894 (3.7) % ” %Total Medicare2,941 2,992 2,925 (1.7) % 0.5 %Medicaid8,926 11,018 9,028 (19.0) % (1.1) %Federal Employees Health Benefits1,656 1,640 1,660 1.0 % (0.2) %Total Medical Membership45,760 47,306 45,776 (3.3) % ” %Other Membership (in thousands) Dental Members7,021 6,775 7,008 3.6 % 0.2 %Dental Administration Members1,878 1,708 1,851 10.0 % 1.5 %Vision Members10,382 9,861 10,275 5.3 % 1.0 %Medicare Part D Standalone Members258 261 260 (1.1) % (0.8) %Other Metrics (in millions) CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts80.2 77.3 78.2 3.8 % 2.6 %Carelon Services Consumers Served101.3 104.8 102.3 (3.3) % (1.0) % 1.BlueCard ® membership for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is restated to align to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reporting methodology.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below. Prior amounts may be grouped differently to conform to the current presentation. Net adjustment items per share may not sum due to rounding.

(NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00.1.Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures.2.Earnings per diluted share ("EPS").

See "GAAP Reconciliation."3.Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein.Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses.

Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1$0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin15.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share.

Basis of PresentationOperating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.Elevance HealthEarnings Release Financial Schedules and Supplementary InformationQuarter & Year-to-Date Ended September 30, 2024Membership and Other MetricsQuarterly & Year-to-Date Consolidated Statements of IncomeCondensed Consolidated Balance SheetCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsSupplemental Financial Information - Reportable SegmentsSupplemental Financial Information - Reconciliation of Medical Claims PayableReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresElevance HealthMembership and Other Metrics(Unaudited) Change fromMedical Membership (in thousands)September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024Individual1,299 999 1,281 30.0 % 1.4 %Employer Group Risk-Based3,672 3,754 3,648 (2.2) % 0.7 %Commercial Risk-Based4,971 4,753 4,929 4.6 % 0.9 %BlueCard ®16,677 6,737 6,692 (0.9) % (0.2) %Employer Group Fee-Based20,589 20,166 20,542 2.1 % 0.2 %Commercial Fee-Based27,266 26,903 27,234 1.3 % 0.1 %Medicare Advantage2,047 2,064 2,031 (0.8) % 0.8 %Medicare Supplement894 928 894 (3.7) % ” %Total Medicare2,941 2,992 2,925 (1.7) % 0.5 %Medicaid8,926 11,018 9,028 (19.0) % (1.1) %Federal Employees Health Benefits1,656 1,640 1,660 1.0 % (0.2) %Total Medical Membership45,760 47,306 45,776 (3.3) % ” %Other Membership (in thousands) Dental Members7,021 6,775 7,008 3.6 % 0.2 %Dental Administration Members1,878 1,708 1,851 10.0 % 1.5 %Vision Members10,382 9,861 10,275 5.3 % 1.0 %Medicare Part D Standalone Members258 261 260 (1.1) % (0.8) %Other Metrics (in millions) CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts80.2 77.3 78.2 3.8 % 2.6 %Carelon Services Consumers Served101.3 104.8 102.3 (3.3) % (1.0) % 1.BlueCard ® membership for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is restated to align to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reporting methodology.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below.

INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00. Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures. Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2 $1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3 $2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin1 3.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,3 5.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation." Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein. Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.

Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1 $1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin1 4.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1 $0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin1 5.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Elevance Health GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited) This document references non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted Shareholders' Net Income, Adjusted Shareholders' Net Income Per Share, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Gain, Adjusted Operating Expense and Adjusted Operating Expense Ratio, which are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below. Prior amounts may be grouped differently to conform to the current presentation. Net adjustment items per share may not sum due to rounding.

Title: Will Ford's Q3 Results Boost Its Underperforming Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/17/will-fords-q3-results-boost-its-underperforming-stock/

GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 21: A Ford F-150 Lariat PowerBoost ybrid pickup truck is displayed for ... [+] sale at a Ford dealership on August 21, 2024 in Glendale, California. Ford announced it is upending its electric vehicle (EV) strategy for North American vehicles to focus on hybrids, affordability, and longer ranges. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Ford stock is expected to publish its Q3 2024 results in the coming weeks, reporting on a quarter that saw the company’s delivery growth slow considerably in the U.S. We expect Ford to report revenue of about $41.7 billion, marking a modest increase of about 1% compared to last year, while earnings are likely to come in at about $0.51 per share, slightly ahead of consensus estimates and up about 40% compared to last year. Now, Ford stock has underperformed this year, falling by about 7% year-to-date, compared to fellow U.S. auto giant GM which has gained close to 35% over the same period. So what are some of the trends that could drive Ford’s results for the quarter? See our analysis of Ford Earnings Preview for a closer look of the key drivers of Ford’s earnings. Ford’s U.S. sales increased slightly to 504,039 units in Q3, marking just a 1% rise compared to the 7% growth from the same period last year. High interest rates have made vehicle financing increasingly costly, curbing consumer demand. The pandemic-fueled pricing power automakers once enjoyed is also waning as U.S. consumer spending softens. Despite these headwinds, Ford outperformed the broader U.S. automotive market, which saw a 2% drop in volumes, driven in part by strong hybrid and electric vehicle sales. Hybrid sales, in particular, surged 38% to 48,101 units, while electric vehicle sales grew by 12%. Notably, Ford’s truck deliveries rose 6% year-over-year. Now Ford’s earnings performance has been uneven. In Q2 2024, adjusted profits came in at $0.47 per share, missing estimates and marking a 35% decline from Q2 2023. This lagged behind GM, which exceeded expectations. While Ford saw revenue growth of about 6% in the last quarter, earnings were dragged down by surging warranty repair costs linked to quality issues with vehicles produced in 2021 and earlier. These warranty costs have been a recurring pain point for Ford, with unexpected spikes—such as an $800 million increase in Q2—catching investors off guard. While concrete improvements in quality and warranty expenses are likely to take some time, Ford could benefit from a higher mix of truck sales as well as strong growth at its premium Lincoln brand. Ford stock’s performance over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 137% in 2021, -42% in 2022, and 16% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While there are concerns regarding the broader automotive market, Ford has a couple of positives that could drive future performance. One key shift is the company’s more balanced approach to electric vehicles. Previously, the slow pace of Ford’s EV transition weighed on the stock, but this is now easing. Ford’s revised strategy—focusing on a diversified portfolio of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles—positions it well to meet evolving consumer preferences without over-committing to costly EV development. This strategy could help to improve profitability, as slower EV growth across the industry allows Ford to optimize its traditional segments while gradually refining its electric offerings. Separately, recent changes to U.S. monetary policy could also provide a tailwind. Last month, the Federal Reserve implemented its first rate cut in nearly four years, reducing the benchmark federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. With room for further rate reductions, lower borrowing costs may stimulate demand for big-ticket purchases such as vehicles, benefiting automotive players such as Ford. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? We value Ford stock at $14 per share, about 28% ahead of the market price.

Title: Down 5%, What's Happening With Nvidia Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/17/why-did-nvidia-stock-fall-5/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T09:00:52Z

POLAND - 2024/09/30: In this photo illustration, a Nvidia logo is displayed on a smartphone with ... [+] binary code in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock fell by close to 4.5% on Tuesday. Peer AMD stock also saw a sharp decline, falling by about 5%. The selloff follows an earnings report by chip manufacturing equipment supplier ASML which indicated weaker-than-expected sales guidance for 2025, raising concerns among investors about global chip demand. ASML produces highly sophisticated photolithography machines, particularly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography equipment, which is essential for manufacturing cutting-edge semiconductor chips including the GPUs that Nvidia sells. ASML said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in at between Euro 30 billion to 35 billion, which is toward the bottom end of its previous forecast, with gross margin forecasts also coming in below estimates. Now, although the decline in guidance was attributed to slower chip demand recovery outside of the AI sector, Nvidia, being the world’s biggest semiconductor company by market cap, was impacted considerably. Additionally, there have been reports that the Biden administration may restrict sales of advanced AI processors to some Persian Gulf countries, citing national security concerns. This stems from worries that these countries could act as a conduit for China to acquire U.S. semiconductor technology that is currently banned from direct export to China. While Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI revolution, Here’s A Better AI Pick Than Nvidia stock The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? To be fair, Nvidia’s sharp stock decline on Tuesday may have been an overreaction. Much of the capital expenditure cuts that are likely impacting ASML potentially come from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung foundries, rather than from TSMC, Nvidia’s primary manufacturing partner. However, Nvidia stock still appears pricey. At its current market price of $132 per share, the stock trades at about 46x consensus FY’25 earnings and 33x FY’26 earnings. There are also risks ahead. See our scenario analysis on Could Nvidia Stock Crash To $40? The big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs. Competition is also mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, the economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenue. There are concerns that companies are investing in AI due to the fear of missing out, rather than focusing on returns. This could eventually lead to reduced capital spending and impact Nvidia, We value NVDA stock at $88 per share, about 33% below the current market price. See our analysis on Nvidia Valuation: Is NVDA Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for NVDA stock.

Title: JPMorgan Chase is winning the AI banking race — and its lead is getting bigger

Time Published: 2024-10-17T09:00:00Z

JPMorgan Chase (JPM-1.02%) held onto its spot as the artificial intelligence adoption leader in the banking sector. The largest U.S. bank has the highest volume of AI talent, which has grown 16% in the past 12 months, and has more AI researchers than its seven biggest competitors combined, according to the latest Evident AI Index, released Thursday. “JPMorganChase is unquestionably still the bank to beat when it comes to AI maturity,” said Evident co-founder and co-CEO Annabel Ayles. “The pace of its AI adoption is remarkable for an organization of its size and scale.” JPMorgan had been investing in AI for years before the chatbot craze took hold with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. The financial institution hired its head of AI research, Manuela Veloso, in 2018 and has since grown its use cases to more than 400. And JPMorgan is already beginning to see the dollar value of its commitment. Company President Daniel Pinto said last month that the bank is expecting to see nearly $2 billion in returns from its investment into the technology this year, particularly related to fraud prevention. “Going forward, we think that artificial intelligence, large language models will have — and we are doing a lot of work on this over the medium- to long-term — a big impact in improving processes and efficiencies in the operational services that we have,” Pinto said. Since Evident began its rankings in early 2023, the top four banks have not only remained in their positions but have continued to plow forward. “The leaders are just pulling ahead and leading more,” Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Evident co-founder and co-CEO, said in an interview. Evident evaluates 50 major banks in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific based on public data relating to AI adoption, scoring the institutions based on talent, innovation, transparency, and leadership. While all 50 banks in the index have ramped up their adoption efforts since last year, the top 10 are improving twice as fast as the rest of the field, Evident found. Mousavizadeh said banks that are committing to AI are going all in: hiring, poaching talent, figuring out internal systems, testing, and partnering with major players such as Nvidia (NVDA+4.08%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.16%). “We can see these dynamics are creating bifurcation in the banking system,” Mousavizadeh said. “If you are slightly standing still, at what point does it become almost impossible to catch up? I would say we’re 18 months away from that.” A number of banks are doing the opposite of standing still. The biggest riser in this year’s index is Morgan Stanley (MS-2.32%), which jumped seven points and landed itself a spot in the top 10. The investment bank first partnered with OpenAI in March 2023, when it became the AI startup’s only wealth management partner. The firm rolled out the AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant, a generative AI chatbot that helped financial advisors access the bank’s vast array of technical know-how, in September 2023. And this past June, the bank rolled out Debrief, a generative AI assistant that will support its financial advisors, built on OpenAI’s GPT-4. “The rise of HSBC (HSBC-1.20%) and Morgan Stanley show that it’s still possible for banks that have been slower out of the gates on AI to catch up and even overtake the field,” Ayles said. “The race for AI adoption is far from run, but there’s a growing gap between the leaders and the rest of the field. The lower ranking institutions need to pick up the pace if they wish to go the distance.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Most Promising Future Stock According to Analysts

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. READ ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Microsoft Headquarters Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 21.71%% Microsoft Edge is one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, as it is the biggest software provider. Additionally, the company is a leading player with a 25% market share in cloud computing while flexing its muscle in the multi-billion gaming industry with Activation’s Blizzard and Xbox. With the aid of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well-positioned to increase its market share in those software categories. During the June quarter, the number of users of Microsoft 365 Copilot grew by more than 60%. Regarding revenue from cloud infrastructure and platform services, Microsoft Azure lags behind Amazon Web Services; however, over the past year, Azure has gained a percentage point of market share thanks to its strengths in machine learning and artificial intelligence and according to CEO Satyr Nacelle, Azure AI’s customer base increased by almost 60% during that time. The vast majority of Microsoft’s planned capital expenditure increases will go toward expanding its AI infrastructure and cloud business. In its fiscal year 2024, it spent $55.7 billion, of which $19 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. Because of its strengths in cloud computing and enterprise software, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the businesses most positioned to profit from generative AI in the future. In fact, Wall Street predicts that over the next three years, the company’s earnings will increase by 13% per year. Even though Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, It is one of the most promising stocks given its record in returning shareholder value. The company already pays a 0.80% dividend yield. Additionally, the stock is rated as a strong buy based on 30 Wall Street analysts with an average price target of $504.73, implying a 21.71% change from the last price of $414.71. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45% Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%. Cloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Likewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year. By the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector. This is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers. Record profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ‘s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company’s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025. After other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.” Overall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth.
