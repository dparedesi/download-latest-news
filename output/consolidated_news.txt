Nearly two dozen states on Tuesday warned CEOs of the nation’s largest financial firms – including BlackRock’s Larry Fink and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon – to scrap “woke investing” programs focused on environmental goals if they want to continue doing business in their states. Letters signed by 26 state financial officers hit the desks of top bosses at BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, State Street and Vanguard. State officials ordered these firms to take five concrete actions to demonstrate their “commitment to a fiduciary model grounded in financial integrity, not political advocacy.” Among these steps is a commitment to abstain from “international political agendas” like net-zero climate mandates or the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Directive, which requires companies to regularly publish reports on the environmental and social risks they face. In the letters, leaders of red states slammed the erosion of “traditional fiduciary duty” in favor of ESG investing, or the environmental, social and governance goals of financial firms. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” officials said in a copy of the letter obtained by The Post. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers. We expect detailed evidence that your firm’s investment practices, proxy voting and corporate engagement behavior…align with traditional fiduciary standards.” Officials from 21 states – including Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah – demanded that CEOs respond to the letter’s demands by September 1. Some states have more than one official represented on the letters. The letters come after Texas last month removed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its blacklist. For nearly three years, BlackRock was banned from doing business with Texas state pension and investment funds, which hold an estimated $50 billion in assets, over its climate policies. BlackRock earlier this year rolled back some of its environmental goals, exiting the Climate Action 100+ investor group and withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The company, however, is still engaging in some practices that seek to restrict fossil fuel output, according to a report from the American Energy Institute and Consumers’ Research, a conservative nonprofit. While Texas may have let up the pressure on BlackRock, these 21 states are doubling down on calls for financial firms to eradicate ESG goals. “Requiring America’s financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state’s dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” OJ Oleka, CEO of State Financial Officers Foundation, said in a statement. “For too long, firms like BlackRock have followed the ESG gospel to the legal breaking point of violating their traditional fiduciary duty and putting Americans’ retirement savings at risk.” Advertisement

WEATHER ALERT Josh Boak And Paul Wiseman Associated Press Published: July 29, 2025 at 5:52 AM Updated: July 29, 2025 at 7:41 AM Josh Boak And Paul Wiseman Associated Press WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants" if the costs are untenable. Recommended Videos The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump's policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there's the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. With new tariffs in place, there are new costs for factories The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. Still lots of uncertainty, but world economy faces a new toll There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow" show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn't say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn't blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. Trump says no inflation from tariffs, but businesses see higher prices The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Keeping the economy on a knife's edge Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’'' he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

Title: Novo Nordisk lowers sales and operating profit outlook for 2025

July 29, 2025 07:02 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 July 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced sales and operating profit growth at constant exchange rates (CER) for the first six months of 2025 and updated full-year sales and operating profit outlook at CER. In the first six months of 2025, Novo Nordisk’s sales increased by 18% and operating profit increased by 29%, both at CER. Sales growth in the first six months of 2025 was positively impacted by gross-to-net sales adjustments related to prior years, including an adjustment related to the 340B provision of around DKK 3 billion in the second quarter of 2025. Operating profit growth is positively impacted by the ocedurenone impairment in the second quarter of 2024, partially countered by impacts related to the acquisition of the three Catalent manufacturing sites. Novo Nordisk has updated the full-year outlook for 2025, with sales growth now expected to be 8-14% and operating profit growth expected to be 10-16%, both at CER. Sales and operating profit growth reported in Danish kroner is now expected to be 4 and 7 percentage points lower than at CER, respectively, primarily due to depreciation of the USD/DKK exchange rate1. The lowered sales outlook for 2025 is driven by lower growth expectations for the second half of 2025. This is related to lower growth expectations for Wegovy® in the US obesity market, lower growth expectations for Ozempic® in the US GLP-1 diabetes market, as well as lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy® in select IO markets. For Wegovy® in the US, the sales outlook reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition. Despite the expiry of the FDA grace period for mass compounding on 22 May 2025, Novo Nordisk market research shows that unsafe and unlawful mass compounding has continued, and that multiple entities continue to market and sell compounded GLP-1s under the false guise of ‘personalisation’. Novo Nordisk is pursuing multiple strategies, including litigation, to protect patients from knockoff ‘semaglutide’ drugs. Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff ‘semaglutide’ drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients. As unsafe and unlawful mass compounding continues, the Wegovy® penetration within the cash channel has been lower-than-expected. Within this channel, NovoCare® Pharmacy was launched in March 2025. Wegovy® prescriptions via NovoCare® Pharmacy (including TeleHealth collaborations) amount to around 11,000 total weekly prescriptions, in addition to around 20,000 weekly prescriptions in the retail cash channel. Novo Nordisk will continue to invest in the expansion of direct-to-patient initiatives such as NovoCare® Pharmacy and further collaborations with telehealth organisations. Within the insured channel, despite the initiation of new commercial activities of Wegovy® in the first half of 2025, the sales outlook also reflects lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy®, mainly due to slower market expansion and competition. Novo Nordisk continues to engage in additional commercial initiatives and expects a regulatory decision around the Wegovy® MASH indication during the second half of 2025. Moreover, Novo Nordisk continues to expect a positive contribution from changes to the CVS national template formulary effective 1 July 2025, where Wegovy® is now the only GLP-1 medicine covered for obesity. For Ozempic®, the updated outlook is negatively impacted by competition in the US. Novo Nordisk continues to invest in commercial activities and label updates towards driving further market penetration of Ozempic®. Finally, while IO Wegovy® sales are growing at high rates and launches are progressing, the sales outlook reflects lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy® in select IO markets due to slower market expansion and competition. With around 1 billion people living with obesity globally and only a few million on treatment, the outlook reflects a continued global rollout of Wegovy® to more markets. The updated expectation for operating profit growth reflects the lower sales growth outlook, partially countered by reduced spending. A negative mid-single-digit operating profit growth impact related to the acquisition of the three former Catalent manufacturing sites remains included in the guidance. Novo Nordisk now expects financial items (net) for 2025 to amount to a gain of around DKK 3 billion. This is mainly driven by expected gains on hedged currencies, primarily the US dollar, partially offset by interest expenses related to funding of the debt-financed Catalent transaction. Finally, the free cash flow is now expected to be DKK 35-45 billion, reflecting the lower-than-planned expected sales growth, mainly driven by lower volume growth of GLP-1-based treatments in the US and related cash flow implications amplified by the US gross-to-net system. Novo Nordisk’s full disclosure of the financial results for the first six months of 2025 will be published on 6 August 2025, where more information will be available. The above expectations are based on additional assumptions, including assumptions described on pages 14 and 15 of the Financial report for the first three months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 14/2025).

Title: Abaxx to Pilot Digital Title Framework for Tokenized-USD Money Market Funds, Targeting Legal Finality and Identity Gaps in Real-Time Collateral

July 29, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: Abaxx Technologies Inc. Abaxx Technologies Inc. TORONTO, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abaxx Technologies Inc. (CBOE:ABXX)(OTCQX:ABXXF) (“Abaxx” or the “Company”), a financial software and market infrastructure company, majority shareholder of Abaxx Singapore Pte Ltd., the owner of Abaxx Commodity Exchange and Clearinghouse (individually, “Abaxx Exchange” and “Abaxx Clearing”), and producer of the SmarterMarkets™ Podcast, today announces the completion of a pre-feasibility study on the use of tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as financial collateral using Abaxx’s proprietary ID++ and Private Digital Title technologies. Building on its Q4 2025 gold-backed collateral pilot, the Company is now advancing discussions with institutional partners to conduct a second pilot transaction in Q4 2025. This next phase will test how tokenized MMF shares — when paired with Abaxx’s legal and identity infrastructure — can serve as legally enforceable, real-time collateral in regulated markets. The results will inform a full feasibility study and lay the foundation for the Abaxx USD Trust Network, as further detailed below. Key Features of the Second Pilot “The race to tokenize MMFs and the growth of stablecoins have rightly focused on efficiency gains, but they often sidestep the most critical challenge: the legal certainty required by regulated holders,” said Josh Crumb, Founder and CEO of Abaxx. “The ability to reduce settlement risk in atomic Delivery-Versus-Payment (“DvP”) transactions and unlock capital trapped in legacy T+1 cycles is transformative, but those benefits are an illusion without a trusted identity layer and enforceable title. The Abaxx Private Digital Title framework is architected to solve this by embedding identity and legal clarity directly into the asset — creating a truly native digital instrument with the integrity required to serve as high-quality collateral in institutional markets. This pilot is the next step in our mission to build smarter markets.” A New Framework for Digital Collateral Abaxx’s vision is to re-engineer the relationship between financial assets and risk management in global markets. To support this transformation, the Company has developed multi-layered market infrastructure designed to connect tokenized and traditional assets to collateral workflows — anchored by Abaxx’s regulated market infrastructure and proprietary ID++ Technology and suite of console applications, including Verifier+, Abaxx Messenger, Abaxx Sign, and Abaxx Drive. This integrated infrastructure addresses two persistent barriers to real-time finance: limited collateral mobility and the high cost of managing counterparty and legal risk across borders — the default condition when transacting in global commodity markets. Abaxx’s Private Digital Title system embeds legal ownership and verifiable identity directly into the asset through digitally-issued documents of title, offering an enforceable alternative to tokenization models that rely on centralized issuance, new legal constructs, or shared ledgers treated only as mirrors of off-chain records. These architectural decisions are designed to reduce legal and operational friction, shorten onboarding timelines, and support more flexible use of real-world assets as collateral, without compromising regulatory compliance or transaction confidentiality. This approach directly addresses the challenges highlighted by the Futures Industry Association (“FIA”) which notes the cleared derivatives industry is at an “inflection point” in adopting tokenization to accelerate collateral mobility. As the FIA’s recent whitepaper underscores, achieving real impact requires solutions that solve for legal finality and regulatory interoperability², goals that the Abaxx USD Trust Network is designed to meet through a privacy-preserving, real-time cryptographic legal agreement registry. “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called the tokenization of stocks and bonds the future of markets³ — and he’s right. But that future depends on solving two core challenges: identity authenticity and legal certainty,” said Ian Forester, Head of Product at Abaxx. “Trends in digital assets tend to focus on building the next ledger, but the core challenge of tokenization isn’t ledger integrity, it’s liquidity. By perfecting legal claims within the asset itself, our Private Title framework allows for the creation of a composable ‘real time USD’ asset secured by tamper-proof, identity-based signatures that are agnostic to the underlying ledger. This approach not only preserves the rights of parties to transact in private, it builds liquidity through trust that is backed by the rule of law.” About the Pilot and Feasibility Study The planned Q4 2025 pilot for the Abaxx USD Trust Network will test the full lifecycle of a tokenized MMF share, with the objective of demonstrating atomic settlement and establishing unequivocal legal finality. The pilot will exclusively use MMFs that are compliant with SEC Rule 2a-7, target a stable $1.00 value per unit, and invest in high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. Findings of the pilot will inform a full feasibility study and may deliver a comprehensive legal and operational package for regulators and asset management partners, subject to regulatory approvals and compliance requirements. ¹ “Collateral supply, demand and mobility,” Securities Finance Times, June 5, 2024.² “Accelerating the velocity of collateral: The potential for tokenisation in cleared derivatives markets,” Futures Industry Association, June 2025.³ “Tokenization of the market, from stocks to bonds to real estate is coming, says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, if we can solve one problem,” CNBC, April 12, 2025.

Title: Inside Robinhood’s Crypto-Fueled Plan For World Domination

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Crypto financiers might seem unlikely guests at the Château de la Croix des Gardes, a 25-acre Belle Époque villa commanding the Bay of Cannes from its hillside perch. Yet on a sun-drenched June afternoon, Robinhood commandeered the storied estate, famous for its star turn in Alfred Hitchcock’s To Catch a Thief, for “To Catch a Token”—a crypto field day conceived by longtime Côte d’Azur resident Johann Kerbrat, the firm’s head of crypto. The spectacle opened with a cinematic flourish: a video of Robinhood cofounder and CEO Vlad Tenev driving a midnight-blue 1962 Jaguar E-Type convertible along the corniche, an homage to Cary Grant’s entrance in Hitchcock’s film. When the reel faded, Tenev stepped out in real time—decked out in a pinstriped white Tom Ford suit, black-and-white ascot, green attaché case in hand—to greet an invitation-only crowd of more than 300 that included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and top brass from financial heavyweights JPMorgan, Mastercard and Stripe. The theatrics are warranted. Robinhood’s stock is trading at $111 a share, an all-time high 384% above last year’s levels, vaulting the brokerage firm’s market cap to nearly $98 billion and into the ranks of the world’s 250 most valuable companies. In 2024, it generated $1.4 billion in profit on nearly $3 billion in revenue and now holds $255 billion in assets, expanding at a 44% net deposit growth rate over the past year. In terms of active or funded accounts, Robinhood, with 26 million, is rapidly gaining share on Schwab, with 37 million, is three times larger than Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade and six times larger than Merrill Lynch. Tenev’s personal fortune has jumped sixfold in a year to $6.1 billion. Guerin Blask for Forbes The 38-year-old chief executive operates in perpetual motion. In late May, he is in Las Vegas, preaching to 35,000 bitcoiners about how crypto will further disrupt global finance through tokenization—the process of converting assets like stocks, bonds and real estate into digital tokens that can be traded 24/7 on blockchain networks. From there, he bounces to Tampa for a conference for registered investment advisors, and a few weeks later he’s in Robinhood’s posh Manhattan offices for its annual shareholder address. “It’s New York this week, then France, then the U.K.,” he rattles off before listing more than a dozen Robinhood offices across America, Europe and Asia. “I have to visit each one at least once a year, and they just keep multiplying.” Despite his boyish looks, including a hair bob and goatee reminiscent of Errol Flynn’s 1938 Robin Hood, Tenev these days sounds very much like the seasoned chief executive of a giant financial conglomerate. The upstart brokerage that blossomed from the ashes of the global financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement has grown up. It wants to be a one-stop financial firm for tech-native generations who prefer transacting digitally. Within the next 20 years, accor­ding to Cerulli Associates, they are expected to receive some $124 trillion in assets, mostly from their Boomer parents. A week before his staged entrance at the French estate, Tenev explained the method behind Robinhood's events. "The pace of rolling out new products has been pretty high,” he said. “It's a good way to show to the world what we're doing. We have to figure out what story we're telling with each one, and it also really motivates people." The get-together at the Château marks Robinhood’s first-ever international and crypto-focused event, dense with announcements. Starting in July, Robinhood is allowing European users to trade blockchain-based “stock tokens,” nonvoting derivatives that track hundreds of U.S. stocks and ETFs, including privately owned tech juggernauts SpaceX and OpenAI. The trading will be commission-free, 24 hours a day, five days a week. For U.S. customers, crypto staking—the practice of locking digital assets to blockchain networks like Ethereum or Solana to earn income—will finally be permitted. Robinhood’s June acquisition of Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million will unlock perpetual futures with no expiration on bitcoin and ether for continental customers. To underpin it all, Robinhood is building its own blockchain. “We as an industry find ourselves at an important preci­pice,” Tenev told the VIPs fanning away the Riviera heat. “We have a chance to prove to the world what we’ve believed all along, that crypto is much more than a speculative asset. It has the potential to become the backbone of the global financial system. We are hoping to turn that from a possibility to an inevitability.” To understand the coup Tenev is planning, it helps to revisit Robinhood’s turbulent past. In 2013, Tenev and his cofounder, Baiju Bhatt, two Stanford physics and math grads, saw a world ripe for disruption. After college, the two developed software for giant hedge funds whose high-frequency trading dominated Wall Street. It was a front row seat to these funds’ nearly insatiable appetite for trading volume, which they were willing to pay for. Retail investors who were accustomed to paying commissions of, say, $10 or $25 per trade at brokerage firms like Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Merrill Lynch could be a great source of this volume. Tenev and Bhatt built a fun and easy-to-use mobile trading app for novice tra­ders that eliminated account mini­mums and commissions because they knew hedge funds would pay them to execute their customers’ trades. They then marketed their zero-commission platform under the slogan of democratizing investing and rolled it out with the fanfare of a new blockbuster video game. Before Robinhood even launched, its Apple app store waitlist swelled to nearly 1 million people. By September 2019, the incumbents—Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (acquired by Schwab in 2020) —eliminated their fees, cementing the upstart’s approach as the new industry standard. The triumph, however, didn’t last long. In early 2021, after trading on the app exploded thanks in part to pandemic lockdowns and millions of stimulus checks, Robin­hood became the focus of a regulatory firestorm during the GameStop meme-stock trading frenzy. Spurred by the Reddit community WallStreetBets, GameStop’s stock price soared dramatically—seemingly without regard to the dismal underlying financials. This unprecedented volatility triggered a massive collateral demand from Robinhood’s clearinghouse, forcing Tenev to halt purchases of the stock on the platform. Cue user fury, Main Street vilification and congressional grillings, including questions over the suicide of a young Robinhood options trader. But rather than retreat, the GameStop trading debacle—which exposed how outdated, opaque and slow U.S. stock trading is—crystallized an idea Tenev had been mulling. “Could we actually put stocks on blockchains?” he says. “My belief was that the value would be in taking stocks 24/7.” Robinhood first tried to modernize legacy systems by partnering with alternative trading platforms like West Palm Beach–based Blue Ocean to extend trading hours. However, these efforts hit a wall. “I didn’t realize how difficult it would be to change these core infrastructure elements because so many things depend on them. Maybe that was a little bit naive,” Tenev admits. Meanwhile, his crypto chief, Kerbrat, was exploring other ways to execute his idea. With U.S. regulators taking a cautious stance on digital assets under the Biden administration, the team took the experiment to Europe, where a rulebook was already in place. “Sometimes it’s easier to start with new infrastructure and build it from the ground up. We believe the technology can scale to any jurisdiction, and over time we’ll be able to figure out how to make it available everywhere in the world,” Tenev says, knowing his lucrative trading volume machine could grow exponentially as millions of investors worldwide start trading U.S. stocks like memecoins. While Kerbrat worked on tokenization in Europe, Robin­hood was reinventing itself elsewhere. In March 2024, Bhatt, now worth $6.7 billion, exited the company (he stepped aside as co-CEO in 2020) to pursue a new venture in space-based solar energy. Despite lingering customer litigation from GameStop, Tenev was busy introducing a wave of new products—IRAs, high-yield savings accounts, a credit card offering 3% cash back (with 3 million people on the waitlist), a private banking service for cash delivery on demand and sophisticated options tools previously reserved for institutional investors—turning Robinhood into “a mousetrap to trade anything,” in the words of Brett Knob­lauch, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. The whirlwind of launches matches its architect’s own cadence. In a moment of reflection, the Bulgaria-born Tenev lifts his palms in a what‑can‑you‑do shrug. “I just wake up, work, eat, work out, go to sleep. My wife doesn’t love it when I say this, but I actually prefer to integrate work into personal life as much as possible.” What Tenev says he didn’t fully anticipate during Robinhood’s explosive growth was how deeply accessible trading resonates with the entrepreneurial spirit. At a private event in Miami last year, the company’s top users included not just self-taught day traders but small-business owners and startup founders—people who approach markets with the same DIY mindset that built their companies. This fiercely independent impulse, he believes, is Robinhood’s real protective moat: “Entrepreneurs don’t trust other experts to do their stuff for them. They like to figure things out for themselves.” Robinhood is engineered for them—a control panel for those who want to manage their own money without gatekeepers. Tenev plans to dominate next-generation investors in three phases he calls “arcs.” First, win the active trader market, where the ROI is immediate, as evidenced by Robinhood’s current strong results. Medium-term, around five years, he wants to serve the entirety of his customers’ wallets, from credit cards to crypto, mortgages and IRAs. Third arc: Build the number one global financial ecosystem, presumably with Robinhood’s blockchain as its backbone. Says Tenev, prepping for the next day’s shareholder meeting, “This will be much larger than the first two arcs. The opportunities start slowly but compound over time.” Tokenization may be Robinhood’s long-term ambition, but its core crypto business is already a juggernaut. In 2024, its crypto revenue reached $626 million, up from $135 million a year earlier, accounting for more than one-third of total transaction-based revenue. In the first quarter of 2025, crypto revenue has already reached $252 million. “They’re eating Coinbase’s lunch in the U.S. right now,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly. In May 2025, Robinhood’s crypto volume spiked 36% month-over-month while Coinbase’s dipped, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Knoblauch notes. Coinbase still owns the institutional market, he concedes (“their offering is much broader and custodial”), but Robinhood’s takeover of Bitstamp, finalized in June, handed it 5,000 institutional accounts and additional licenses in Europe and Asia. Tenev and Kerbrat insist Robinhood’s approach is fundamentally different from that of crypto exchanges like Coinbase. “In this industry people talk to you about the advantage of this [blockchain] layer versus this layer and just forget at the end of the day about the end user. We don’t want to build a technology just to talk about the technology. We want to build something that people can use on the day-to-day and actually see the advantage compared to the alternative financial system,” Kerbrat says. Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital and an early backer of Robinhood, Coinbase and their European competitor Revolut, says focusing on the Coinbase-Robinhood rivalry is shortsighted. “To me, the question for the next ten years is how much market share they take from the incumbents. It’s not a fight amongst them,” he says. Knoblauch estimates Robinhood’s $255 billion in assets under custody will rival Interactive Brokers’, which has $665 billion in client assets, within seven years. Next up, Charles Schwab, which the analyst calculates Robinhood has gained share on for 14 straight months. Tenev is also serious about diversifying. The old Robinhood was criticized for being a payment for order flow (PFOF) junkie, dependent on heavy trading volume and the most aggressive Wall Street hedge funds. Transactions still account for 56% of its revenue (down from 77% in 2021), but today Robinhood has ten business lines on track to each generate over $100 million in revenue within two years, according to John Todaro, managing director at Needham & Company. Take Robinhood Gold. What began as a simple $5 per month or $50 per year premium service, offering margin access, professional research and a little extra yield on balan­ces, has evolved into the centerpiece of Tenev’s powerful subscription model. Among its current perks: 4% yields on brokerage cash, interest-free margin loans up to $1,000 and a 3% match on IRA contributions. The newly released Robinhood Gold credit card, which offers 3% cash back on all purchases, was just sent to the first 200,000 customers. “If they get to 15 million users on Gold, you’re looking at close to a billion dollars of subscription revenue. It’s taking a business that used to be very cyclical to having recurring revenue, then diversifying the overall revenue base,” Knoblauch says. Then there’s Robinhood Strategies, Tenev’s new hybrid robo-human advisory product gunning for old-school stalwarts like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch in the $60 trillion U.S. wealth management business. For a 0.25% annual management fee, capped at a flat $250 for Robinhood Gold members, customers get tailored portfolios of stocks and ETFs, algorithmically managed and rebalanced with human oversight. Since launching in March, this disruptive new platform has already brought in $350 million. Tenev describes his company’s approach to new products as scientific, empowering small teams inside Robinhood to test hypotheses with customers who provide immediate feedback to its initiatives on social networks. “A lot of companies will just look at what’s happening in the outside world and copy it, sort of a competitive benchmarking. When we launch products or new features, we do it because we like to figure stuff out,” Tenev says. Robinhood’s recent launch of home mortgages—currently at 6.1% for 30-year fixed plus $500 toward closing costs—is the result of a stealth online pilot it ran starting in June. “It went all over social media. Then I acknowledged we were running the pilot in a tweet. It was probably one of my most viral tweets of the year.” Tenev’s tokenization push is a bit of a moonshot, and Europe, which has already adopted many of the crypto road rules still being deba­ted in Congress, is Robinhood’s lab. “The experiment that we’re running in Europe is, What would Robinhood look like if it was rebuilt from the ground up entirely on crypto rails? Then we’ll see what the pros and cons are and bring the best of that EU app to the U.S. and the rest of the world,” he says. So far the tokenization of stocks is minuscule. xStocks, a new but already leading platform from Switzerland’s Backed Finance, has tokenized more than 60 listed equities, inclu­ding household names such as Apple and Amazon, and made them available on large crypto exchanges like Kraken and Bybit. xStocks has less than $10 million in daily volume. Structural issues abound: These tokens are derivatives backed by assets held off-chain, which means routine corporate actions like dividends, stock splits or other things that might occur over a weekend, when markets are closed, could scramble collateral calculations and risk unintended liquidations. “Some market maker has to take that risk, and how will they hedge that risk when there is no market open? If they’re going to take that risk, they need to blow their spreads and charge people a lot of money,” says Dragonfly’s Hadick. “The infrastructure is not there at the moment on the off-chain side, and the on-chain product is not there yet. . . . I’m worried these initial products are going to be essentially duds.” This hasn’t stopped others from jumping in. In June, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini launched tokenized trading with MicroStrategy shares for its EU customers. Coinbase is reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized stocks, and even Larry Fink, CEO of $12.5 trillion (assets under management) BlackRock, is urging the SEC to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds. Robinhood is going further. Besides public stocks, it’s tokenizing private companies and has already announced tokenized shares of Open­AI and SpaceX, each valued at more than $300 billion today. Open­AI has already publicly disavowed Robinhood’s product, emphasizing the tokens are not authorized or recognized by the company. “Nobody, no founder, wants their equity floating around on-chain with holders they don’t know,” Hadick warns. Tenev is a weathered veteran when it comes to facing naysayers. “It’s still a little crufty,” he admits, using pejorative coder slang for unnecessarily complex software. “I don’t think the brokers want to make it easy for us to pull their stocks out. But what happens when it becomes self-custody? When you can tokenize and self-custody, you can be independent of the brokerage infrastructure—the same way you can load a crypto wallet on MetaMask, Robinhood or Coinbase, you’ll be able to seamlessly use any interface to hold your stocks and trade them in pretty much all instances.” This is precisely why Tenev is obsessed with making Robinhood his young customers’ sole tool for all things related to money. When it comes to retail financial services, inertia is second in power only to compound interest. Customers are inherently sticky, but Tenev knows that the old giants of the financial world, including Fidelity, Schwab and Merrill Lynch, are vulnerable as trillions in Boomer assets are bequeathed to their digital-native offspring. In fact, he thinks his biggest competition will come not from firms like Coinbase or Fidelity but from the Anthropics and OpenAIs of the world: “They’re the ones moving the fastest and doing the most interesting stuff. Though I would say it’s too early to proclaim the financial industry being disrupted by ChatGPT.” Early Robinhood investor Malka, whom Tenev calls his mentor and whose firm has already profited on its stake by more than $5 billion by Forbes’ estimates, is an unabashed Tenev fanboy. “Robinhood has a leader who’s not even 40, who is extremely AI-native, understands where AI goes, understands tokenization, and he’s leveraging those two strategies like very few can,” he says. “We’re just starting to get the right setup to bring the ‘internet moment’ of money, where anybody in the world can save in the same product. Loans are going to get cheaper because credit underwriting is going to get better. All those things.” Tenev believes Robinhood will ultimately employ AI agents to replicate and improve on the services of high-net-worth family offices, putting a “family office in your pocket.” AI is so central to Tenev’s vision that the former math Ph.D. candidate couldn’t resist recently cofounding and becoming chairman of AI startup Harmonic, which he leads with computer scientist Tudor Achim, who previously led autonomous driving startup Helm.ai. In July, Harmonic raised $100 million in Series B funding from Kleiner Perkins, Para­digm and Sequoia, valuing it at $875 million. The “mathematical superintelligence” lab is building an advanced reasoning engine, one that “guarantees accuracy and eliminates hallucinations.” No doubt a useful feature in the coming age of AI and money. “It would be pretty amazing to solve the Riemann hypothesis, or one of the other big Millennium problems, on a mobile app,” muses Tenev, referring to the most profound unanswered mathematical questions. “Rather than obser­ving that, I hope to be actively participating.” Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink and Ken Griffin, take note.

The Heritage Foundation's Michael Pillsbury unpacks trade talks with China amid market volatility on 'America's Newsroom.' As data centers multiply across the United States, energy demand is increasing at a rapid pace. This has not escaped the notice of large investment firms from Wall Street. The likes of BlackRock and Blackstone are trying their very best to acquire utility companies in hopes of capitalizing on lucrative grid upgrades. On the other side of things, consumer advocates and regulators are raising alarms, worried that these moves prioritize profits over public service. For your information, BlackRock and Blackstone are two of the biggest investment management firms in the world. They have trillions of dollars' worth of global assets and have become the go-to option for companies that need money. They have enormous influence across various industries and make money by investing in many different types of businesses.

(Wikipedia) In a bold move last year, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners, along with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, proposed acquiring Minnesota Power, a utility serving 150,000 customers. The acquisition, which could support tech companies with energy access for new data centers, received initial support from state agencies after negotiation. Even the Minnesota Department of Commerce dropped its opposition after reaching an agreement. However, Administrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie delivered a surprising recommendation on July 15th, urging regulators to deny the deal. She cited troubling signs that profit was the driving force behind the acquisition. "The nonpublic evidence reveals the partners’ intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control," Judge McKenzie wrote. "The partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little." It's important to note that the judge's recommendation is not final; state regulators will make the ultimate decision on whether the acquisition goes through. Power lines. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Opposition is mounting from climate advocates and watchdogs. Nichole Heil from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project voiced concerns over financial burdens and rate hikes: "No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms." Electricity bills are already climbing nationwide. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average monthly household bill rose nearly 4% in April to $175 a month. This is the average for a single household using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. To address these concerns, the Minnesota Department of Commerce brokered a deal that includes key protections. These measures prohibit passing acquisition costs onto customers and preserve programs for low-income households. "These commitments include a substantial array of additional public interest benefits, risk-mitigation tools and customer protections beyond those originally proposed," the agency noted. A lightbulb with arms and legs plugging itself into a wall outlet. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) If Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Blackstone acquire your local utility, rates could increase as they strive to maximize returns for their shareholders. Sure, they might improve the infrastructure and service, but history shows that when these types of companies come in, customers often end up paying more. They need to be kept in check to balance infrastructure investment while making energy affordable for regular Americans. The rapid increase in demand for tech has made utility ownership a battleground between profit-driven investors and consumer advocates. While firms like BlackRock and Blackstone argue that their resources can modernize aging grids, critics warn of a future where reliability and affordability take a backseat. With regulators now at a crossroads, the outcome in Minnesota may set the tone for utility ownership nationwide. Do you think companies like BlackRock and Blackstone owning utilities is a good thing?

Title: Rooftop Solar Is a Miracle. Why Are We Killing It With Red Tape?

Illustration by Guillem Casasús; Getty (3) Bill McKibbenSeptember+October 2025 Issue Earlier this summer, Tara McDermott, who’s in charge of policy communications for a New York state solar developer called EmPower Solar, was telling me a woeful tale a lot like others I’d been hearing lately. A customer whom I’ll call Pam had tried to put solar panels on top of her home in Mount Vernon to save money and help the planet. EmPower submitted its first permit application to the city in September 2023 and then went back and forth with them for months as the city asked for revisions, updated proof of insurance, and other documentation from Pam. Eventually, one of McDermott’s colleagues got fed up and reached out to the mayor for assistance—in fact, he drove to City Hall and asked to see her. Upon being told that she wasn’t in her office, he said he’d sit there and wait for her return. “It turns out the mayor was indeed there in her office and couldn’t leave without passing him,” McDermott recalled, warming to her tale. “So they called the police on my guy to remove him from the space—they deemed him a threat.” Eventually, after some negotiation, two cops were detailed to accompany the EmPower employee upstairs to the building department, and they all sat there for two hours while staff worked on the permit for the solar panels. But not, unfortunately, the permit for the electric wiring that goes with it. Before that step could happen, Pam’s loan agreement expired. “There are no options left and she probably can’t go solar. And we’ve spent hundreds of hours on this one house,” McDermott told me. This tale was absurd enough on its own. But then she said something else, almost in passing: “Our CEO went to southern Spain two years ago during all this, just staying with some friends at their house there. And they wanted solar, and he was the solar guy, so they asked him. They all went to the local store, something like Best Buy, and they picked the system he recommended and signed up, and by the time he left Spain two weeks later, it was already installed and running. This wasn’t DIY or under the radar. They did it legally. Imagine that world.” In many countries, people don’t have to imagine it. A million and a half Germans have installed “balcony solar”—they simply went to the big-box store, bought a giant panel for a few hundred euros, hung it from their apartment railing, and produced up to a quarter of their household’s power needs. Other European countries have followed suit. Ditto Australia, where Saul Griffith, author of the new book Plug In!, notes that permits can be had in a single day using a smartphone app—“the tradie [contractor] often does this for you. In Australia, it takes two or three days once you’ve made the decision to do it to get the system up and running.” But not in America, where President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are pulling out all the stops to destroy renewable power. They’ve shut down big offshore wind projects, they’re limiting projects on public lands, and the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only rolled back tax credits for large-scale renewable projects, it took direct aim at precisely the kind of rooftop solar work that thousands of small contractors like EmPower produce. Upon news that the bill would phase out tax credits for residential solar by the end of 2025, the already depressed stock price of Sunrun, the country’s biggest residential solar provider, fell 40 percent; PV Magazine, the industry trade journal, headlined its story “U.S. Residential Solar on the Brink of Collapse.” That’s a very real possibility—we’ve seen the same thing once before, when the Reagan administration withdrew federal support for solar installers and, almost overnight, the solar workforce plummeted. The cuts the GOP-controlled Congress pushed through in July could take out as many as 400,000 jobs, per recent estimates. Notably, these latest efforts come after the two hottest years in human history and at a moment when, worldwide, solar power is growing faster than any energy source in history—putting both the planet and the country’s technological leadership at risk. So giving in to Trump’s attack is not an option. Instead, we need to figure out how to keep rooftop solar growing even without the federal tax credits that have spurred it in the recent past. Doing that will require, among other things, unclogging the peculiarly American system of local permitting that has played a huge role in making “going solar” far more expensive than it needs to be. If Pam’s system had gone up in an afternoon with far less paperwork, we’d be in a very different place—a place where the “abundance” debate meets the climate crisis and offers a real way out. “It’s so cheap to build a solar panel now. It’s cheaper than producing a plank of wood…But we’ve swaddled this engineering miracle in rolls and rolls of red tape to make it too expensive for American families.” Let’s go back to Australia for a moment. Down under, Griffith says, “rooftop solar installs at about 55 cents a watt, meaning electricity that ends up costing 2 or 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. In the US, it averages about $2.50 a watt, and in San Francisco, I paid $5.80 per watt.” That means it takes much longer to recoup the cost of a project and far fewer people are willing to take it on. About a third of Australian homes now have rooftop solar—seven times more than in America. The glacial speed of our local permitting plays a huge role. Contractors have to keep “rolling trucks” to revisit your roof and redraw plans. By some estimates, a one-week delay can result in a 10 percent client cancellation rate, which means solar developers have to spend ever more money on customer acquisition. (You’ve seen the ads.) Meanwhile, interest accrues on any loans taken out to finance such projects—it all adds up. The slow permitting is not the only problem—once the panels are on the roof, utilities often drag their feet in connecting them to the grid, part of the fossil fuel industry’s ongoing war against renewables. Some areas have made meaningful progress with this “interconnection” problem, and the work to push utilities to move faster continues, often at the level of state public utility commissions and the seven “independent system operators,” or ISOs, that run the nation’s grid. But these big power players can’t do much about, say, the Mount Vernon building inspector. America’s commitment to local control enables a tangle of entities to set the pace of solar growth. Happily, because many of those jurisdictions are firmly in blue hands, there’s still plenty to be done, even with Washington doing its damnedest to sabotage clean energy. Democratic leaders seem to be warming to the abundance agenda—at least they’re finally talking about whether America can be reconfigured to once more build ambitious projects. But even if we could wave a magic wand and get projects like high-speed rail or clean-power transmission corridors moving, such monumental efforts will take a while and, as with former President Joe Biden’s spending on clean energy, voters might never notice the improvement—or know who deserves the credit. But up on your own roof? You notice that. If you could easily get a permit to install a low-cost machine that could save you money, and, oh yes, also help ward off the civilizational challenge that is climate change, you might start thinking a little differently about government. Forget YIMBYs for a moment—we’re talking YOMRs. You’ve got a right to the sunshine that falls on your home, whether you’re a renter with a balcony or a homeowner. Free the electron! We’re used to thinking of roofs as protection from rain—but the sun can also provide a shower of dollars and cents, and some bureaucrat shouldn’t force you to stay at the mercy of Big Utility. Why should the Chinese and the Australians and the Germans get access to the sun while you’re denied it? I mean, what the hell—we’re bathed in free energy every daylight hour and we need a bunch of permits to use it? What’s American about that? “It’s so cheap to build a solar panel now,” says Nick Josefowitz, who runs the advocacy group Permit Power. “It’s cheaper than producing a plank of wood. It’s one of the great engineering miracles of our lifetimes. But we’ve swaddled this engineering miracle in rolls and rolls of red tape to make it too expensive for American families.” Although they’re reluctant to say it publicly, some industry people I spoke with said that it was possible to imagine a robust solar industry without any government subsidies (see Australia)—so long as bureaucracy got out of the way. Want to prove government can still work? Looking for ways to balance American individualism with concern for the collective good we call “the environment”? Ready to shake off the fossil fuel oligarchy that helped lead this country into its political morass? To the ladders! Rooftop solar is not the only source of clean energy, of course. Utility-scale solar—big solar farms—accounts for twice as much generation in this country and a lot of the startling takeoff in clean energy around the world. But adding big projects to the grid can be complicated—you need new transmission lines and substations, which the Biden administration was working to provide and the Trump administration is now busy blocking. Fossil fuel industry players and some utilities have also deployed astroturf groups to block such projects; according to Heatmap News, this partly explains why, in at least 20 percent of US counties, it’s now essentially impossible to deploy large-scale clean energy. So rooftop solar is a nice complement to the grid, both physically and politically. There’s enough wasted space up above our heads to supply a significant portion of the nation’s energy needs—one study found that we could generate 45 percent of our electricity this way; at the moment, we only harvest about 2 percent. Often, that rooftop array supplies power to the grid and, increasingly, it also fills batteries in the basement, which can not only power the house at night or charge an EV, but also make that house far more adaptable in times of crisis. Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun, said that during the Los Angeles fires, when the power company cut the juice for hundreds of thousands of people out of fear its wires would spark more blazes, “our homes became the safe haven, the place where people could recharge their phones to get the news alerts. This is critical infrastructure.” And the line between rooftop and utility-scale solar has begun to blur; new software allows the aggregation of thousands of home batteries into “virtual power plants” that can be dispatched by a utility to lessen the load on the grid. In California, Sunrun has knit together a network of 75,000 home batteries—together, they could supply enough power to run, say, all of Ventura County (pop. 830,000). In Vermont, where I live, the biggest single power plant on our grid is the network of interconnected batteries that can be called up in a pinch by Green Mountain Power. The nation’s biggest virtual power plant is now being built in Texas by stringing together hundreds of thousands of customers who use Google Nest thermostats. These networks are not just resilient—a single power plant can fail on a hot day, but not 10,000 basement batteries—they also save big money. By reducing the need for utilities to build new power plants to account for “peak loads,” the Department of Energy estimated in 2023 that battery networks could save customers at least $10 billion a year. So, dramatically expanding the amount of solar on the roof would be an unmitigated good. As Solar United Neighbors—a nonprofit that has helped more than 11,000 families go solar, concentrating on low-income neighborhoods—puts it, “demanding utility accountability and deploying distributed solar in under-resourced communities and communities of color can catalyze a shift toward a new, equitable, distributed clean energy system.” But all of that depends, first and foremost, on making rooftop solar cheap so that more and more families and landlords can afford it. And that, in turn, depends in part on dramatically reducing the thicket of regulations that get in the way of easy deployment. There’s enough wasted space up above our heads to supply up to 45 percent of the nation’s electricity needs; at the moment, we only harvest about 2 percent. It’s hard for people to imagine, I think, that permitting costs could make such a difference—surely it’s a marginal part of the cost, compared to, you know, the panels. But the truth is that low-cost manufacturing pioneered by the Chinese has driven hardware costs to bizarre lows. Even before Trump upped the tariffs on foreign panels, Americans were paying three times as much as Australians for rooftop solar, and that’s explained almost entirely by the “soft costs” of permitting, marketing, and installation. Andrew Birch, who had previously lived in Australia, remembers the hopeful days of his startup two decades ago. “We started Sungevity in the US because we thought it would be this free open market where we could sell online easily,” he says. “It turned out to be just the opposite.” When visitors would stop by to see his new operation, it seemed almost magical. “We’d take them to see the sales floor, which was full of people at computers, talking to customers. Even then, you could see a house on Google Earth and calculate quickly how much power solar could provide—our agents could design a system in a few keystrokes. Our visitors were impressed. But then I’d have to say, ‘Let’s go to the other building’—where we had another whole team, doubling the size of the company, doing customer management and permit creation work. It takes an average of three months to set up a system, and five to six months in the Northeast. And all of that head count and work adds $1.50 a watt.” The soft costs are literally more expensive than the hardware—it’s like spending a thousand bucks for an iPhone and then another thousand for the apps. “You have to arrange a site visit and drive a truck out there,” Birch says. “You have to climb up on the roof to get the rafter spacing, do incredibly elaborate electrical drawings. Then you roll another truck to the permit office. They might have different views about how to interpret the drawings, which means change orders, which means another resell to the customer.” All of this would be bad enough if there were a single regulator to respond to, as in most countries. But in America there are something like 20,000 separate jurisdictions—cities, towns, counties—that approve building plans. Each is different. A solar contractor in a metro area might have to deal with a dozen or more permitting offices. Sungevity died during the first Trump administration, but Birch hasn’t given up the fight. He now runs OpenSolar, “the world’s first free, end-to-end platform designed to help solar professionals grow their businesses and streamline their operations.” But those installers still run into permit blockage, which is why Birch spends much of his time proselytizing for another piece of software: It’s called SolarAPP+, and it was originally developed by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory precisely to make permitting easier. In the several hundred jurisdictions that have adopted the tool, installers go through a checklist—what model of solar panel, what kind of inverters, how they plan to tie into the house’s electrical system—and the app spits out a permit so they can get to work; when they’re finished, an inspector can come out or, in some cases, simply review photos the installers send. Other countries have dispensed with permits altogether (in Australia, spot inspections keep installers on their toes), but in the US, SolarAPP+ is probably as streamlined as we’re likely to get. And where it’s in place, it seems to work. Louis Woofenden, a Tucson-based solar installer, says he can now get permits in a day as opposed to about five weeks in the past. As a result, he can far more easily quote prices to potential customers: “And there’s something to being able to say, ‘I have an installation slot in six weeks,’ not three months.” Matthew McAllister, who runs the SolarAPP Foundation, says about 5 percent of the nation’s residential rooftop projects now get one of its automated permits—it topped 1,000 permits a week for the first time this past spring. “Our goal by the end of the decade is to be able to process half of applications, which would be enough to really influence soft costs and prices.” His organization has mapped out the 1,000 jurisdictions it thinks are likely to install the most solar, and is reaching out to building departments one by one—in the last year, New Orleans and Palm Beach County in Florida have come on board. “One thing we’re always working on is to communicate that we’re a very lightweight software tool,” he says. “A level above a Chrome extension, not an IT replacement. It integrates with their existing software.” Legislatures in California, Maryland, and most recently New Jersey have instructed their local communities to switch to SolarAPP+, and other states are considering it, but it’s always a battle. The Colorado legislature gutted a proposal this past spring to switch its communities to the technology, even though it had the potential to dramatically increase installations and save Coloradans $1 billion on their energy bills by 2030. “Local officials may think, ‘I’ll lose my job,’” Birch says. “We tell them: You’ll do five times as many solar permits. If you’re just inspecting 1 in 5, you’ll do as much work, and the city will get five times the fees.” But that doesn’t mean it’s an easy sell to jurisdictions used to Doing Things a Certain Way. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which developed SolarAPP+, has two campuses in Colorado; Boulder County is a hotspot for climate scientists and has seen terrifying wildfires in recent years. (If you want to scare yourself silly, check out footage of families fleeing a Chuck E. Cheese near a horrendous 2021 blaze.) And yet in March, the county opposed a state bill to require the use of SolarAPP+. Ron Flax, Boulder County’s chief building official, says he’s a “huge fan” of the app, but “making it mandatory is always a little bit controversial. Any bill that tells a jurisdiction you must do X, Y, or Z—well, they value their freedom of choice.” His inspectors, he says, “still find things.” Some years ago, they had installers who weren’t grounding panels correctly—“We don’t have a well-established apprenticeship program for trades in the US; the actual craftsmen, these are not well-paid folks”—but today, he admits, zoning regulations are a bigger headache. In any case, one senses that Flax would be just fine if Boulder residents didn’t want so many solar panels. Building mostly utility-scale solar would be “optimal,” he told me. “If my baseline electric grid is made up of mostly renewables, then I really don’t want a lot of rooftop solar,” he explained. “It’s more efficient to do that at a grid scale.” That kind of attitude—which effectively tables the idea of distributed power generation networks—seems particularly common in progressive communities. Like Boulder, San Francisco is jam-packed with people who care about the climate, but their former mayor and current governor, Gavin Newsom, has emerged as perhaps the country’s most significant obstacle to rooftop solar, deferring to utilities and unions by reducing the price that homeowners can get for the power they sell to the grid; he even vetoed a bill last year that would have made it easier for schools and hospitals to install solar. (“We’re expending so much time, emotional and intellectual energy in Sacramento just not having the space harmed more,” says Sunrun’s Powell.) The Bay Area may be the single hardest place on Earth to permit rooftop projects. Jeanine Cotter, who runs a local solar business, gives an example: “In San Francisco, where land is expensive, we build right to the lot lines, and so one way to get light in a house is with skylights. Our code says you need 3 feet of clearance around every skylight. But if you have a small roof and skylights, well, the ability to play Tetris with solar panels—it just gets harder.” Grace Kennedy-Panda and her sister co-own a Bay Area solar business started by their father in the 1980s. She says the regulations—and fees—change constantly: “Permitting a solar-battery system even recently was $200, and now it can cost three or four thousand dollars. There’s not a whole lot of clarity we can give our customers.” Even installing appliances that in some jurisdictions have become pretty standard can be a bureaucratic rat nest in the Bay Area. Consider electric heat pumps, which replace gas or oil furnaces and are an easy way to cut both energy use and emissions. Getting them permitted is onerous in many Bay Area cities, building decarbonization policy expert Sam Fishman says. Gas furnaces and water heaters are greenlit quickly because building departments are used to them, but put a heat pump water heater in a garage, and you might be subject to requirements that really only make sense for gas appliances, such as raising it on a stand or installing bollards to make sure a car can’t run into it. “There’s an assumption that things need to be done in a perfect, buttoned-up way,” he says. “Checking too many things and going through so much process only adds the most tiny margin of safety and health improvement and is actually costing thousands of dollars.” One possibility is that America will simply sit out the global solar boom in the same way Cubans, thanks to endless embargoes, still drive ’57 Chevys. The extra costs are high enough that many locals install heat pump appliances without pulling permits—but the rebate programs for low-income residents, who benefit the most from these money-saving appliances, all require copies. The problem has reached the point where the California legislature is weighing a “heat pump access act” to standardize and streamline permitting. All this red tape might be necessary if it were in response to some epidemic of fires caused by badly installed solar panels. But that epidemic doesn’t exist—not in Australia, not in Germany, not in California. I’ve spent some of my life as a volunteer firefighter, and I can tell you what causes blazes: not heat pumps or solar panels but space heaters, which are what many poor people use to heat their homes. Think about California, where big gas explosions have caused carnage, and whose massive wildfires are clearly linked to global warming—against which solar panels are the best weapon. Even worse, the sparks that set off these blazes often come from drooping utility transmission lines brushing up against dry foliage—whereas more rooftop solar means fewer new peaker plants and dangerous transmission lines. “We’re over-indexing certain kinds of fire prevention,” Cotter says. “The individual house versus the mass catastrophe. We feel much more comfortable piping natural gas, which we ignite to cook our foods and heat our homes. We know it’s not safe for our planet, nor for the people around it that have to breathe the fumes. But we’re okay doing that because we’ve been doing it for 100 years.” If all of this sounds like a place where an anti-regulatory right might find common ground with an environmentally minded left, well, there are signs of it happening. The deep-red Utah legislature this past winter became the first in the country to allow balcony solar. In the Southeast, a group called Conservatives for Clean Energy has pushed Republican legislators forward on solar power. Its biggest victory came in Florida, where it helped convince Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto anti-solar legislation—in the three years since, the Sunshine State has seen a respectable boom in solar installations. “That allowed us to say, ‘Here’s a Republican governor who helped us save rooftop solar,’” says Mark Fleming, head of CCE and a former aide to former Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). The group focuses on economic arguments—in many rural counties in the Southeast, solar projects are among the biggest taxpayers—but especially when it comes to rooftop solar, its case is partly ideological. “There’s a private property rights thing—an ‘I’ll do what I want on my land’ kind of argument,” Fleming says. Polling has long found that solar power is popular across the political spectrum. My sense, having lived most of my life in dirt-road districts, both red and blue, is that conservatives are often deeply attracted to the idea of producing their own power. If you have your own energy source up on the shingles, then your home really is your castle. But unless you absolutely reject government authority, you still need those permits. One of Fleming’s board members at CCE, Stew Miller, has run a solar installation company in North Carolina’s Research Triangle for 16 years. “Raleigh has instant permitting, which is great,” he said. “But other jurisdictions want us to take 100 photos, even though they may only look at four or five of them. When you’re up on a roof and it’s 95 degrees and they want a picture of every single panel—it gets to be very tedious. Our crews just resent it.” Right now, the world wants to go solar—but the Trump administration is bucking that trend. A few weeks before the November election, Trump declared that solar was “all steel and glass and wires and looks like hell.” (Somewhat mystifyingly, he added, “And you see rabbits, they get caught in it.”) One possibility is that America will simply sit out the global solar boom in the same way Cubans, thanks to endless embargoes, still drive ’57 Chevys. Perhaps, having self-embargoed from the clean energy future, America will someday be a living museum of coal-fired power plants and basement furnaces. If we aren’t going to be left behind, we’re going to have to push. Engineers and scientists have done their job, dropping the price of clean energy 90 percent in a decade. Now environmentalists, entrepreneurs, YIMBYs, advocates for clean air, and local communities have our own job to do: convincing everyone else that rooftop solar is no longer “alternative” energy. As costs have plummeted, solar has gone from being the Whole Foods of energy to the Costco of power—available in bulk, on the shelf, and cheap in most of the world. If you’re feeling helpless against the administration’s attacks on the environment, you might want to join a big fall day of action, Sun Day, which will celebrate clean power, and push for solutions like SolarAPP+. We need to take on utilities, shake up the public utility commissions, and start to get Congress back on the side of the future. I’m hoping that a nationwide celebration of clean energy might prompt the same kind of momentum we’ve seen from housing advocates over the last few years, who’ve made headway pushing for zoning codes to finally be reformed. “We’ve got the hardware solved,” says OpenSolar’s Andrew Birch. “We’ve got the sunshine.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop ‘Can Be A Tough Place To Work,’ But Its Vision Is Clear, A New Biography Claims: ‘It’s All About Gwyneth’

ByRachel Burchfield ByRachel Burchfield, Contributor. Gwyneth Paltrow attends the 2023 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on November 6, ... More 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/FilmMagic) Love her or hate her—when it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, it’s difficult to look away. This has led to the popularity of Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, Goop, since its creation in 2008 as a newsletter written from her kitchen table—and that public fascination has now led to the writing of journalist Amy Odell’s new book Gwyneth: The Biography, out July 29. Odell tells me over Zoom that she spent three years interviewing more than 220 people who knew Paltrow at different stages of her life—ranging from friends to those who worked with her on movie sets to those who worked with her at Goop—“and I wanted to pull back the curtain on how she became so famous and so polarizing,” she says. “She’s someone people are magnetically attracted to, but she’s also been super controversial, and that’s what I think the book does, is really tell that story and also explain how she impacted various industries—entertainment, obviously, but also fashion, beauty and, perhaps most significantly, wellness.” All of Paltrow’s life experiences—from being a 1990s “It Girl” and winning the Academy Award for Best Actress at just 26 years old to being raised as the privileged daughter of Bruce Paltrow and Blythe Danner (as Odell reminds me, “I mean, Steven Spielberg is her godfather”) and so much in between—led to the creation of Goop 17 years ago and its trajectory ever since. While Odell’s book covers so much more than Goop—from her high-profile relationships to her childhood to her acting career—it also leans heavily into Paltrow as an entrepreneur. “She seems really ambitious,” Odell tells me. “She obviously juggles a lot of things capably.” She’s authentic, she adds, and “was never shy about just being who she is. This is all she knows. So I think that really works in her favor.” Gwyneth Paltrow attends Veuve Clicquot Celebrates 250th Anniversary with Solaire Exhibition on ... More October 25, 2022 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/WireImage) It’s nearly impossible to separate Paltrow the businesswoman from Paltrow the woman, and Gwyneth paints a holistic portrait of the 52-year-old’s life. Of Goop, Odell says, “Gwyneth made it very appealing through her taste—her really good taste—and she made it a world that people wanted to be a part of.” At the office, Paltrow is known mostly as “GP”; she often rolls up to the Goop offices—wearing, of course, Goop’s G. Label clothing line—and parks her white Range Rover in a spot labeled “Reserved for G-Spot.” As a boss, “Some people find it to be quite challenging,” Odell says of Paltrow. “But I think the good thing about working for her is that her vision is very clear. She has this extraordinary taste—a really sophisticated aesthetic and aspirational aesthetic that she brought to the wellness industry. I think that’s, in part, what made Goop and Goop’s wellness content so appealing. It was this gorgeous, aspirational aesthetic she brought to it.” Dr. Ella Bell and Gwyneth Paltrow, CEO and Founder of Goop, speak onstage during day three of The ... More MAKERS Conference 2024 at The Beverly Hilton on February 29, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for The 2024 MAKERS Conference) Right down to the company’s name, Paltrow is in the midst of it—Goop was chosen as a moniker because of Paltrow’s initials, GP, and the perceived fact that companies with double Os—think Google or Yahoo!—did well. According to Odell’s book, Paltrow initially thought the name was “stupid and funny,” and she has also said in the past that Goop was “an old nickname” (her father, Bruce, apparently used to call her “Goopie”). True to Paltrow’s authentic nature, two Miramax executives told Odell that they remembered Paltrow using a Goop@aol.com email address back in the 1990s. She is who she is. As a boss—Paltrow has served as CEO of Goop since 2016, eight years after founding it—she has “very strong ideas and a very clear vision,” Odell says. “The problem is, she wanted to do everything, and she wanted to do it all perfectly.” Paltrow, known as a perfectionist, has also seen Goop spread itself rather thin—from beauty to fashion to wellness to food to newsletters to podcasts to Netflix shows, there are few verticals that the company hasn’t touched. “So people felt overworked, and there wasn’t a lot of money for everything they were doing—some people felt like they didn’t have enough budget for freelancers and things like that,” Odell says. “So there’s a lot of work to be done, and there’s this perfectionism that she wants to achieve. So people felt pressure from that.” Gwyneth Paltrow, Powerhouse Brand of the Year Award recipient, attends The Daily Front Row's Seventh ... More Annual Fashion Los Angeles Awards at The Beverly Hills Hotel on April 23, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Daily Front Row) If you walk into Paltrow’s office, she wants you to get directly to the point, Odell says, and “then you could just go.” When Paltrow shines her light on someone, “it feels amazing and people really thrive, but there’s a fear that it’s going to be taken away,” Odell tells me. If it does get taken away, in comes the stress, and “that stress could just permeate the office environment.” Some, Odell says, called Paltrow “icy and cold and aloof,” drawing comparisons to Vogue’s departing editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, whom Odell also profiled in a 2022 biography. “I think it can be a tough place to work,” Odell says. “That said—[it’s] not for everybody. Some people found it to be really tough. Some people ignored the chaos and were fine, and people said they liked that the vision was very clear, which was that it’s Gwyneth. It’s all about Gwyneth.” Much like when Paltrow shines her light on an employee and they feel her warmth, so it is when Paltrow promotes Goop’s products—that’s when they do the best. “They do sell,” Odell says. “People want to buy what she’s wearing. She looks great in the clothes, and she looks great wearing the mascara. So she’s very powerful in that way. But what if she gets tired of it? People tell me she doesn’t love doing the social media content—not that I can blame her. She’s got a lot on her plate.” Gwyneth Paltrow, CEO and founder of lifestyle juggernaut Goop, makes her first appearance in the ... More Tank as a guest Shark on 'Shark Tank.' (Christopher Willard/ABC via Getty Images) Goop came about when Paltrow was living in London with her ex-husband Chris Martin and their two young kids: Apple, born in 2004, and Moses, born in 2006. After becoming a mother, Paltrow dialed back her work as an actress, which seems to be revving up again after both kids have now gone away to college. That leaves questions about the future of Goop—after all, what is Goop without Paltrow? “I’m not saying Gwyneth is not there for the company, but if she changes her mind—so the investors I spoke to, they did not see a super bright future for Goop, I have to say,” Odell says. Before Goop, Paltrow threw her star power behind brands like American Express and Estée Lauder before she realized, “Hey, why am I using my image to promote these other brands when I can use it to build my own brand?” Odell says of Paltrow’s possible thought patterns during that time period. “Which is incredibly savvy. And I think, in that way, she’s like the original influencer, because she realized that she could use her image to drive purchases, and she did really early affiliate deals before anyone was calling them affiliate deals, and now affiliate deals are this huge industry.” “I think she’s been so strategic,” Odell tells me. Gwyneth Paltrow celebrates the launch of good.clean.goop at Goop on October 18, 2023 in Santa ... More Monica, California. (Photo by Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for good.clean.goop) Since its newsletter origins, it has focused on the aforementioned beauty (Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop), fashion (G. Label), wellness (Goop Wellness) and food (Goop Kitchen) verticals; it has had a Netflix series, a podcast, dipped its toe into home furnishings and courted controversy for its perceived pseudoscience and boundary-pushing products, like a viral candle advertised as smelling like Paltrow’s orgasm. Many people told Odell that Goop has spread itself too thin, “that they did too much,” she says. “They raised a lot of money, too. One expert I talked to said they probably never should have raised that much money.” Odell’s many interviews led her to believe that “they can keep going probably for a very long time, just as they are today,” she says. “I think it’s probably really up to Gwyneth—do I want to keep doing this? Do I want to have a little bit more flexibility and maybe license more of this business? I think it’s really up to her.” In September 2024, Goop let go 18 percent of its staff—affecting about 40 people—followed by a second round of layoffs last November. The goal of the reduction is to “optimize operational efficiency and revenue growth in our key verticals of beauty and fashion,” a Goop spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson declined to provide specific revenue figures, but said revenue grew year-over-year in 2023 and was on track to grow again in 2024. While the spokesperson declined to say if Goop—a privately-held company—is profitable, Business Insider did report in November that Goop Beauty revenue was up 21 percent over the year prior, and the fashion brand G. Label was up 45 percent. The outlet reported that Goop has raised more than $140 million and was most recently valued at $433 million (per PitchBook); last fall, Paltrow told WWD that, after the first round of layoffs, Goop was “back in growth mode.” “What I’m most excited about is the refining of the brand that we’re doing—our hyperfocus on beauty, fashion and food,” Paltrow told Fortune in March. “Those are the verticals where we’re seeing incredible product-market fit and margin. Food, beauty and G. Label all grew exponentially last year. Since COVID, we’ve had to stay so agile, and getting to the other side of that and focusing on our strengths—there’s power in that.” Founder and CEO of Goop Gwyneth Paltrow speaks onstage during 'The Rise of Goop: Building a ... More Tastemaking Empire' at Vanity Fair's 6th Annual New Establishment Summit at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on October 22, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Vanity Fair) Paltrow called layoffs “painful” and told the publication that “it’s always a very difficult thing to do, but sometimes for the rigor of the business, it’s necessary.” “I hate doing that more than anything in the world,” she continued, adding that Goop was “very, very close” to being profitable, “which is incredibly exciting, and a big milestone.” Not bad for a newsletter sharing recipes and recommendations with no monetization strategy in place in the company’s early days. Back then, Odell writes, “the whole spectacle of Goop was just plain entertaining, like a very curated look into her life.” Speaking of a look into her life—and into Paltrow’s influence—after she announced in 2014 that she and Martin were separating after 10 years of marriage, famously calling it a “conscious uncoupling,” Goop.com “received so much traffic, the site crashed,” Odell writes. As the company monetized and got into e-commerce, “I didn’t understand anything,” Paltrow said, as quoted in Gwyneth. “I didn’t finish college. I didn’t go to business school. I didn’t go up through a corporate environment.” Going forward, as Paltrow said herself, Goop’s strategy is to niche down on beauty, fashion and food: “The best thing to do is just embrace your niche, and scale can come from that,” Paltrow said at the 2024 Forbes Power Women’s Summit. “A lot of mistakes have come from me not understanding that.” “We have a lot of intention around what we’re doing, and I’m proud that we’re still alive and kicking,” she added.

More Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 day two at Amazon Port Plaza Stage on June 18, 2024 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) If Goop could go back in time, it should have done this from the start, Odell tells me. “People I talked to said she might’ve been better off just trying to prove one vertical first—just do beauty and kill it in beauty, and then maybe you iterate from there,” she says, citing Kim Kardashian’s Skims and its commitment to shapewear as an example. While Skims was founded by Kardashian, it’s not all about Kardashian, “and that makes you stronger, I think, as a celebrity brand,” Odell says. With Goop, “I think what happened there—this is my informed view on it—is that they built out all those different businesses, the clothing, the beauty, the events, all of that,” Odell says. “And they just grew too big. It was just too expensive to do all of that, a lot to build out a staff, to do a beauty line, to do a clothing line, a staff to do content. So they cut back because they needed to. The expenses were just too high.” As Odell writes in Gwyneth, “Not only was the pace and breadth of work unsustainable for employees, it would also prove unsustainable for Goop.” “[But] they’re still there and the company’s still going,” Odell tells me. “And Gwyneth is still the CEO.” These days, Odell was told the Goop Kitchen is the company’s biggest moneymaker—hence food making the cut alongside beauty and fashion as the path forward. When asked about a possible exit someday, Paltrow told Fortune, “I’m in building mode and not thinking about an exit right now. I don’t even really want to think about it for another three years, or even start thinking about it.” Gwyneth Paltrow and Michaela Boehm speak onstage during the goop lab Special Screening in Los ... More Angeles, California on January 21, 2020. (Photo by Rachel Murray/Getty Images) It remains uncertain what will come of Goop, but what Odell knows? “Whatever happens with Goop, Gwyneth will be fine,” she writes in the book. “She has a way of emerging victorious from any calamity.” Goop’s success, in large part, boils down to Paltrow and the public’s inability to take its eyes off her, a woman who Odell writes possesses “an enduring level of status and fascination few ever achieve.” “Goop was a window into a certain elitism,” she continues in the book. “And people couldn’t look away.” To a degree, they still can’t.

Title: Up 80% This Year What's Next For Celestica Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/29/up-80-this-year-whats-next-for-celestica-stock/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T09:30:29Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JULY 27: In this photo illustration, a person holds a smartphone displaying the ... More logo of Celestica Inc. (NYSE: CLS, TSX: CLS), a Canadian multinational electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company, with the company's red and gray dot-matrix C logo visible in the background, on July 27, 2025 in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Celestica (NYSE:CLS) has recently been experiencing significant growth — the stock has risen 80% year-to-date and has more than tripled in value over the past year. What factors are contributing to this increase? The company, recognized for its electronics manufacturing and supply chain services, is benefiting from a surge in demand for AI-powered networking equipment and cloud infrastructure, driven by major technology companies. This upswing is spurring rapid expansion in its Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) division — a segment that encompasses everything from servers and storage to high-performance networking hardware. In Q1 2025, CCS revenue reached $1.84 billion, an increase of 28% compared to the previous year. The key AI-related offerings within this segment include servers, integrated rack solutions, and high-performance networking switches, all of which are essential for modern AI workloads. The extensive AI boom is projected to maintain demand. Major technology firms are currently engaged in unprecedented cycles of infrastructure investment. Amazon is anticipated to allocate as much as $105 billion for capital expenditures in 2025. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are estimated to invest $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion, respectively — much of this directed towards AI infrastructure. This trend should bolster demand for Celestica. How does the stock’s fundamental outlook appear, and will its momentum continue? The stock appears relatively expensive — making it a costly choice to purchase at its current price of around $170. We identify some minor concerns regarding CLS stock. Our conclusion is derived by comparing the current valuation of CLS stock with its operational performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Celestica along crucial metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a strong operational performance and financial health, as outlined below. However, if you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also see: QuantumScape: QS Stock To $0? Celestica’s valuation seems high when assessed against the wider market. While its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.0 is less than the S&P 500’s 3.1, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47.8 is considerably higher than the benchmark’s 22.8. Nevertheless, this is supported by the company's robust recent top-line growth. Revenues have risen at an average annual rate of 19.3% over the past three years, significantly surpassing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. Over the last year, Celestica’s Revenues increased by 21% to reach $10 billion, while the S&P 500 only managed a modest growth of 4.4%. However, its profitability remains behind. The net income margin over the past year was only 4.1% (compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500). Nonetheless, operating performance is showing positive trends, with Celestica achieving a record adjusted operating margin of 7.1% in the latest quarter, up from 5.9% in Q1 2024. This upward margin trend and strong revenue should, in time, lead to higher earnings, potentially justifying the company's elevated valuation. From a financial health perspective, Celestica appears robust, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 4.8%, comfortably below the S&P 500 average of 22.6%. The company maintains a moderate cash reserve that constitutes 5.2% of its total assets. However, CLS stock has historically demonstrated sensitivity to market downturns. For example, during the Covid-19 market crash, CLS plummeted 69% compared to a 33.9% drop in the S&P 500. Likewise, in 2022, amid inflation-related shocks, the stock fell 35.6% during a broader market correction, exceeding the S&P’s 25.4% decline. Additional risks also exist. The company has a significant manufacturing presence in Asia (approximately two-thirds of production), and tariffs imposed by the U.S. government may elevate supply chain costs and exert pressure on profit margins. The high valuation of CLS stock may restrict its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: As if the trade war never happened, stocks could pull off a feat not seen since the late-1990s boom
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/stock-market-outlook-sp500-forecast-7100-trump-trade-war-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T06:02:00Z
Full Content:
Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The stock market has been on a hot streak lately, notching record high after record high, and some bulls on Wall Street think the party isn’t over. That marks a stunning reversal from the panic that gripped investors in April, when President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs shocked the world. Stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar crashed. Markets started pricing in a recession, and analysts slashed their forecasts. But Trump put his most aggressive tariff rates on hold, corporate earnings remained robust, consumers stayed resilient, and stocks rebounded. Even foreign investors jumped back into U.S. markets. Meanwhile, his administration has negotiated several trade deals, including one with the European Union on Sunday that removes the threat of a damaging trade war. Now that the fog of war is lifting, upbeat forecasts that predated Liberation Day are back, meaning stocks could put up big numbers again—as if the tariff shock from a few months ago was all just a bad dream. On Monday, Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus hiked his S&P 500 price target for this year to 7,100 from 5,950, reinstating the outlook he initially made in December 2024. “This year reminds us of the classic Charles Dickens quote, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,'” he said in his latest note. “Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes at least for now.” He cited progress on trade negotiations, strong corporate earnings, and the Federal Reserve’s deft handling of monetary policy, which cooled inflation without causing a recession. If the S&P 500 hits 7,100 this year, it would represent a gain of about 21% for 2025, marking a third straight year with a surge of more than 20%. That hasn’t happened since the late 1990s, when the U.S. economy and the stock market boomed. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the S&P 500 could reach 7,200 by mid-2026, explaining that he is starting to lean closer to that more optimistic “bull case” scenario. He cited strong earnings as well as AI adoption, the weak dollar, Trump’s tax cuts, pent-up demand, and expectations for Fed rate cuts in early 2026. Another member of the 7,000 club is Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo Securities’ head of equity strategy, who has stuck by his S&P 500 forecast of 7,007 even during the trade war. Last week, he reaffirmed it, predicting big tech companies will continue fueling the stock market’s rally despite Trump’s trade policies. “What we’re seeing is the winners continue to win,” he told Bloomberg. “The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trend in AI that will continue.” And over the longer term, this decade still looks like it will be another “roaring 20s,” according to market veteran Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. On Monday, he backed his thesis, which he first posited in August 2020, as productivity advances, a wave of capital outlays, and the endurance of consumer spending will keep stocks buoyant. “If the remainder of the decade continues to play out as the Roaring 2020s, we predict that the S&P 500 will start the next decade at 10,000,” Yardeni wrote in a note. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: SharpLink stakes big on Ethereum: Are institutions moving away from BTC?

What could this mean for supply, staking, and Ethereum’s price ceiling? SharpLink Gaming has ramped up to over 438,000 ETH, signaling deep institutional interest and long-term conviction. Analysts warn of a possible short-term dip before the next breakout. While the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin [BTC] amid growing institutional accumulation, a quiet but significant shift is unfolding in the Ethereum [ETH] space. SharpLink Gaming, a prominent player in gaming and data analytics, has deepened its Ethereum commitment by purchasing an additional 77,210 ETH over the weekend, worth approximately $295 million, per Arkham. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain also confirmed the purchase, which has pushed SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to 438,017 ETH, now worth approximately $1.69 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X A large portion of this stash is staked via platforms such as Figment and Hoppers DApp, signaling a long-term approach rather than speculative accumulation. In fact, SharpLink itself emphasized Ethereum’s 24/7 availability compared to traditional banking hours, pointing to the agility and scalability that make ETH an attractive reserve asset for modern firms. They further added, Source: SharpLink/X Echoing the growing confidence in Ethereum, crypto analyst Crypt Rover posted on X that such large-scale accumulation is a strong signal of deepening institutional inflows. He even predicted that ETH could be on track to hit $10,000, as demand surges and long-term holdings tighten supply. This shows that with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin serving as chairman and former BlackRock strategist Joseph Chalom as co-CEO, SharpLink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and Web3. If it fulfills its acquisition goal, the company would hold over 1 million ETH, or approximately 1% of the total supply. According to ETH Strategic Reserve data, SharpLink is now the second-largest holder of ETH, trailing only Bitmine Immersion Tech, which holds 566,000 ETH. This coincided with ETH trading at $3,871.72, up 1.12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators like the RSI also support a bullish case for Ethereum, showing that buyers currently have the upper hand. Source: Trading View The community also seems to have appreciated this move by SharpLink, as noted by one X user, who said, “$ETH will Moon!” Echoing similar sentiments, another page — WISE, added, “Oufff so bullish” Thus, with both sentiment and fundamentals lining up, Ethereum’s current trajectory could be signaling a larger trend in crypto capital allocation. However, Alphractal’s Liquidation Heatmap indicates a cluster of open long positions, hinting that a short-term dip may precede Ethereum’s next breakout as reported by AMBCrypto.

Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information. Unfortunately for those of us in the Web 3.0 space – for now at least – these companies are building the future, not Web 3.0 startups. Centralization is winning the day over decentralization. The fragmentation in Web 3.0 – the fierce competition over so little – is not nearly as appetizing to investors and strategic partners as AI monopolies. Web 3.0 companies should start looking to partner with those companies sitting on a vast GPU supply or a proprietary data organization. These are the companies – the ones that control algorithms – getting inventor funds. A new way forward for crypto Web 3.0 founders are left with no other option than to pivot. The industry has to face it and move towards a new strategy. Big money has found it difficult to navigate the decentralized web of Web 3.0 companies. Instead, centralized powerhouses are the ones building the future, and they could step into the crypto arena at any time and potentially outcompete crypto native incumbents. It’s time for crypto to move on from its messaging chat and X strategy, as well as the promises of decentralization, and start working the phones to get into the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies touching technology. It’s high time to deliver. The idealism of Web 3.0 is proving not to mesh with reality. The quest for decentralization, ownership and democratized value creation has stalled. In the future, Web 3.0 might further fragment. The biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, will begin to pin their fates on centralized solutions, increasingly looking like the tech gatekeepers they once billed themselves as disrupting. The blockchains of tomorrow will exist as integrations into the traditional financial and technology giants, which are looking for supply chain tracking and similar solutions. For the blockchain world, these solutions are the quickest way to real-world utility and a monopoly. The more lofty solutions, such as decentralized data storage, are not making much progress when it comes to market share. Memecoins, redundant DeFi protocols and incomplete metaverses are already suffering under the strain of zero sum competition between one another. There is no crypto community. The incestuous strategic partnerships of crypto projects with each other have resulted in limited innovation. It’s time for Web 3.0 founders to make a change. Billion-dollar partnerships are made via access to C-Suites of the world’s biggest companies – not in the world of hashtags or virtual land. The Web 3.0 companies that don’t adapt to the fact that Web 3.0 has fallen far behind the AI industry in terms of innovation won’t be around for long.

The New York Post is identifying the Manhattan shooter who allegedly opened fire in the office building housing Blackstone and NFL headquarters as a 27-year-old Las Vegas man named Shane Tamura. Tamura allegedly walked into the building and opened fire around 6:30 p.m. and was found dead shortly thereafter. FOX 5 New York noted that Tamura had a “concealed carry permit from Las Vegas” on his person. Breitbart News initially reported the number of shooting victims as three, consisting of one police officer and two civilians. However, numbers were later updated to show at least six were shot, including another police officer who lost his life. At 9:17 p.m. FOX New York noted that at least three of the shooting victims had died. No motive for the shooting has been reported.

Update: FOX News is reporting that the number of shooting victims in Monday’s Manhattan attack now sits at six, two police officers among them. Earlier reports indicated two civilians and one officer were shot. Those same early reports indicated the police officer would survive, but FOX News is reporting one of the two wounded officers is deceased. *****Original story below***** At least three people were shot, including a police officer, in the lobby of a midtown Manhattan office that houses Blackstone and the NFL headquarters. The shooting allegedly occurred around 6:30 p.m. The New York Post reported that the gunman is dead — that he “turned the gun on himself” after shooting individuals. NBC New York pointed out that the attacker was armed with an “assault” style rifle. Ironically, Mike-Bloomberg affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks New York as No. 4 in the country for stringent gun control in part because the state bans “assault weapons.” New York also has heightened background check requirements, a red flag law, a ban on “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and many other gun controls.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: BlackRock’s ETHA becomes 4th-largest ETF by 30‑day inflows as Ethereum funds aim for $10B

Spot Ethereum ETFs register 16 consecutive days of inflows, driven by institutional whales and corporate treasury firms' appetite for ETH. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are close to breaking the $10 billion mark in inflows this month, as BlackRock’s ETHA makes its way to the spot of fourth-largest ETF by inflows in the last 30 days. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Ethereum ETFs accumulated $9.3 billion in inflows as of July 25. This represents a 120% increase from the $4.2 billion registered on July 1, marking 16 consecutive days of inflows. The average daily inflow is $233 million, which would total over $930 million in the four trading days left in July. Even if the average doesn’t repeat itself, the ETFs require $162.5 million daily to reach $10 billion, and 13 out of 16 trading days with inflows have surpassed this amount. ETHA leads the inflows by a large margin, accounting for $9.34 billion in total flows, nearly four times the $2.35 billion in inflows of Fidelity’s FETH. In July, the BlackRock fund represented 91% of the total. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that ETFs took $97.6 billion in inflows in the past 30 days. ETHA took the spot as the fourth-largest ETF, showing nearly $3.9 billion in inflows, roughly 4% of the total. Moreover, Balchunas noted that ETHA registered the 17th-largest trading volume among ETFs as of July 28, 11:25 am ET. He added: “$ETHA 17th most traded ETF today Top 0.4% of all ETFs, first time I recall seeing it in there. Given it is up 5% today and still pretty new a lot of this volume is gonna convert to inflows.” As of press time, ETHA’s daily trading volume stands at $1.35 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, assessed that the rising inflows are driven by both institutional whales and corporate treasury firms’ appetite for ETH. In a note, he said this growth reflects the increased conviction in Ethereum’s utility, sustainability, and long-term staying power, particularly due to its use in tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain settlement. He concluded: “The rise of Ether ETF AUM to over $20 billion, which represents almost 5% of Ether’s total market cap, speaks to this growing strategic asset role it’s now occupying in institutional portfolios.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Ethereum Soars on $1.9B Inflows and ETF Optimism as BlackRock and SharpLink Double Down

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) is once again at the center of investor attention, pulling in a staggering $1.59 billion in inflows over the past week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow in Ethereum’s history, amid growing optimism that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot Ethereum ETF. Overall, digital asset investment products attracted $1.9 billion, marking 15 consecutive weeks of positive flows. This surge in capital has pushed Ethereum’s price up 62% this month to $3,900, positioning it just below the critical $4,000 breakout level. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETPs faced $175 million in outflows, signaling a capital rotation from BTC to ETH and other altcoins. Analysts point to the passage of the Genius and Clarity Acts in the U.S. as key drivers of this trend, enhancing regulatory clarity for altcoin investment vehicles. Institutional investors are doubling down. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) surged past $10 billion in AUM, becoming the third-fastest-growing ETF globally, while the firm raised its ETH holdings to $10.47 billion, with 100% of its crypto exposure now allocated to Ethereum. Simultaneously, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming purchased 77,210 ETH worth approximately $295 million, raising its total ETH treasury to over 438,000 ETH. This single purchase surpassed the network’s entire 30-day ETH issuance, underscoring the aggressive accumulation trend among institutions. Ethereum’s rally is further supported by bullish technical signals. A “golden cross” pattern emerged, and the MACD shows strong upward momentum, despite an overbought RSI reading of 82.07, a level often associated with potential price pullbacks. Solana and XRP also saw inflows of $311 million and $189 million, respectively, while Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash experienced minor outflows. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s on-chain activity surged 288%, reinforcing confidence in the network’s role as the leading smart contract and DeFi platform. As regulatory momentum builds and ETF approval appears within reach, Ethereum’s dominance in institutional portfolios signals a pivotal moment for altcoin adoption—though short-term volatility remains a factor to watch.

Title: BNY Mellon Wealth CIO Shares One Quiet Power Behind Smart Investing

ByGemma Allen ByGemma Allen, Contributor. Sinead Colton Grant - Chief Investment Officer BNY Wealth poses in NYC - 2024 As a child growing up in 1980’s Ireland, Sinead Colton Grant didn’t dream of a career in finance. Instead, her journey to the top ranks of Wall Street started with an unexpected monetary gain. She was a college student headed to Italy on a summer trip when she noticed a pleasant surprise in her finances. The devaluation of the currency just before she left, meant she had a little more Italian lira than she expected. For Colton Grant, this little holiday windfall sparked a lifelong fascination with global finance and smart investing, that would see her rise from FX sales on a London trading floor to become the first female Chief Investment Officer in BNY Wealth history. Her role oversees key decisions at one of the world’s largest private banks. But she shares, that for her, the numbers and portfolios have only ever been part of the story. “Investment isn’t just about returns,” she says. “It’s about trust. Without trust, even the best strategies fall flat.” While she crafts strategies for some of the world’s wealthiest people and foundations, she’s equally attuned to the changing face of wealth, who’s wielding it and how that changing client profile makes trust more important than ever before. I sat down with Colton Grant to discuss her rise through the ranks of an industry where she has often been the only woman in the room, her take on the current investment landscape and how she is witnessing and championing a historic shift in who holds financial power. Colton Grant’s career path has followed the broad arc of globalization and financial markets. After beginning in FX trading and currency management, she pivoted into asset allocation and multi-asset portfolios, before joining Barclays Global Investors and then BlackRock. She views those early years as formative, not just in building technical knowledge but in realizing that at the heart of strong investment strategies is the necessity of clear, human communication. “You can have an amazing investment process, but if you can’t articulate it in a way people understand, no one is going to invest with you,” she shares. That skill, which in practice means translating complex systems into human stories, became a cornerstone of her leadership style and one that would see her move between locations and offices before landing in Mellon Capital. There, she helped develop one of the ten largest liquid alternatives mutual funds in the U.S., before joining BNY Wealth as Deputy CIO and stepping into the CIO seat in 2020 at the height of a global pandemic. Sinead Coltan Grant presenting to BNY clients in Boston with guest, Dan Clifton from Eurasia Group, ... More 2025 Colton Grant shares that while on reflection the pandemic era feels like a fever dream, it marked a unique moment in the investment ecosystem, when the personal, political, and economic suddenly converged. For a leader like Colton Grant, who had built her career on human connection and trust, her appointment as CIO couldn’t have come at a more defining moment. "Managing wealth, is above all, a human business with trust at the center,” she shares, “Our clients aren’t just investing for themselves. They’re thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations.” Increasingly, she notes, those conversations are being driven by a new generation, and a new type of investment profile - women. It’s a shift Colton Grant sees first hand, with a front-row seat to a growing wealth transfer, marked by a significant increase in female participation in angel investing, venture capital, and broader financial decision-making. She shares that this represents more than just a demographic shift. “I meet with more women thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations. It's a mindset shift, and one that’s starting to show up in how capital moves and who’s deciding where it goes. We are now at a time when most of the wealth from the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers is moving into the hands of women,” she continues. “That means more women will be making, or solely responsible for major financial decisions, many for the first time.” Catherine Keating Former CEO BNY Wealth and colleagues Ring bell at NYSE 2022 For Colton Grant, this means that representation isn’t merely a moral imperative, it’s a strategic advantage. "Our clients want to see themselves reflected in the people managing their money. Diverse leadership teams make better decisions. It’s that simple." That also means that helping more women step into investing has become both a personal mission and an economic imperative. “Money means freedom," she says. "Our financial markets have built tremendous wealth over time, and it’s important that more women participate in that wealth creation by investing. I understand why it makes people nervous, but it doesn't have to be complicated. You can start small, with methods like a low-cost S&P index exposure which can generate strong returns over time." What she wants women to realize is that the ripple effects of investing extend far beyond individual portfolios. Women's increased participation creates a flywheel that benefits the broader macroeconomy. "The data shows that more female investors also lead to more female founders receiving seed capital for their businesses. This is vital given that only 2% of overall venture capital dollars go to female-founded start-ups." Asked about her advice to women with the resources to invest but not sure how or where to start? Her reply echoes the age old investment mantra: there will never be a perfect moment. "Time in the market beats timing the market. So just get started," she says. As for this moment we are in right now, marked by an unprecedented level of workplace and market uncertainty, Colton Grant remains bullish on U.S. markets, citing strong underlying fundamentals, backed by innovation capacity, productivity growth, and healthy earning margins. Her investment philosophy doesn't listen to political noise. "You don't invest with your politics," she says, "You focus on the fundamentals." Sinead Colton Grant, Chief Investment Officer, was featured on Fox Business ‘Making Money with ... More Charles Payne’ discussing her market outlook and the future of US exceptionalism. July 1, 2025 When asked where she thinks the opportunity lies, she shares that there are some clear emerging trends reshaping the industry. Private markets, which have long been the exclusive domain of institutional investors, are now more accessible through evergreen investment vehicles. Digital assets are gaining traction, particularly among younger generations, and, of course, artificial intelligence is a key factor. "2025 will be a 'show me' year," she predicts. "It's not just about tech companies, it's about how AI-driven productivity starts to ripple through sectors like healthcare, energy, and beyond." When asked what advice she’d offer women entering finance, Colton Grant boils it downto three things: Speak up, advocate for yourself- don’t assume people will notice your work. Go before you’re ready- don’t wait to tick every box. Know the difference between mentors and sponsors - mentors offer guidance, but sponsors open doors. Above all, however, Colton Grant shares that her trajectory - from a curious college student intrigued by currency shifts, to a leader at the forefront of finance’s biggest transformation - boils down to one undeniable truth: success and smart investing hinges on trust. As she puts it, “people buy people. Trust is everything.” For Sinead Colton Grant, aligning trust is more than virtue, it’s a movement led increasingly by women like her who are reshaping finance from every role: client, leader, founder, and investor.

Title: Watch These Microsoft Stock Price Levels as Tech Giant Set to Report Earnings

Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell slightly on Monday but remain near a record high as investors await the scheduled release of the company's quarterly results on Wednesday. Just as with other Magnificent Seven companies, investors will be seeking updates on the tech giant’s spending plans as the AI arms race among tech rivals intensifies. Last week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) lifted its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion, up from its prior forecast of $75 billion. Microsoft shares slipped 0.2% to close Monday's session at $512.50. The stock has gained nearly 22% since the start of the year, boosted by strong growth in the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment and successful efforts to integrate AI into its Copilot chatbot and Azure cloud platform. Below, we break down the technicals on Microsoft’s chart and point out price levels worth watching out for. Since gapping decisively above the 200-day moving average (MA) in early May, Microsoft shares have trended steadily higher within as ascending channel. During this time, the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA to form a bullish golden cross, while the relative strength index has remained near overbought territory to signal strong price momentum. It’s also worth noting that volatility has fallen sharply in the stock since it bottomed in early April as shown by the average true range percent indicator—a technical tool that signals how much an asset typically moves as a percentage of its price. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential upside target on Microsoft’s chart if the shares continue trending higher and also identify crucial support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast a potential upside target in the stock by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Microsoft’s chart, we calculate the height of the ascending channel from its low to high rounded to the nearest dollar and add that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, we add $93 to $527, which projects a target of $620, about 21% above today's closing price. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should watch for a retest of crucial support around $468. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near last year’s prominent July swing high. Finally, a decisive close below this level could see Microsoft shares drop to $430. This location finds a confluence of support from the closely watched 200-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a series of corresponding price action on the chart extending back to March last year.

Major U.S. equities indexes finished Monday mixed following the weekend announcement of a trade agreement with the European Union. The new trading week promises plenty of economic and financial news, including the Federal Reserve's interest-rate announcement, the latest jobs and inflation data, and a flood of earnings reports from major companies in the tech sector and beyond. The S&P 500 eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3%. Both indexes were at record highs. The Dow slipped 0.1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged more than 10%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance. Supermicro is set to release its quarterly results on Aug. 5. Monday's push higher for the stock followed reports that President Donald Trump has loosened restrictions on technological exports to China in a move to bolster trade negotiations with the country. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 4.3%. According to reports, AMD raised pricing on its Instinct MI350 AI chip, suggesting the company is confident in the capacity of its high-end product to compete with offerings from rival Nvidia (NVDA). UBS analysts boosted their price target on AMD stock, pointing to improving expectations for the semiconductor maker's upcoming earnings report, slated for Aug. 5. Nike (NKE) shares treaded 3.9% higher Monday after JPMorgan upgraded the footwear and apparel maker's stock to "overweight" from "neutral." Analysts highlighted Nike's progress on its multiyear recovery plan, which includes inventory alignment and new performance products, with particular opportunities surrounding next year's soccer World Cup in the U.S. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, suffered the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock, dropping nearly 11%. With the move lower on Monday, Albemarle stock gave back the gains posted over the past week and a half after reports that a large lithium miner in China had suspended operations, helping alleviate concerns about oversupply in the market for the key battery component. Albemarle and other producers have been working to cut costs as they navigate a prolonged slump in lithium prices. Revvity (RVTY) shares fell 8.3% following the medical device maker's quarterly earnings release. Although second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share topped consensus estimates, the maker of instruments and reagents for drug discovery and other healthcare research lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing expected softness in its immunodiagnostics business in China. Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Centene (CNC) stock to "neutral" from "overweight," and shares of the health insurer slipped 5.4%. Analysts pointed to headwinds related to Centene's business in the healthcare exchange and Medicaid markets. At the beginning of July, Centene withdrew its full-year guidance, citing cost and enrollment pressure.

The mood on Wall Street feels a bit like discovering that nothing is broken after a hard fall. U.S. stocks are near record highs to start the week, reflecting optimism about a range of topics that investors have had to ponder. The European Union and the U.S. struck a deal over the weekend, easing corporate anxiety of a protracted trade war. With some of that uncertainty cleared, and earnings so far coming on strong, some analysts are sounding more upbeat than they have for a while. Oppenheimer on Monday lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 7100 from 5950, among the highest held by major Wall Street brokerage firms. The outlook—which brings its target back to where it was to start the year—implies upside of about 11% from Friday's close. Morgan Stanley said the probability of its bull case, which puts the S&P 500 at 7200 in the middle of 2026, was firming up. Numbers like those are a long way from the levels below 5000 seen in April after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement spooked investors. The next few days will test that optimism. "Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes, at least for now," Oppenheimer wrote. The Federal Open Market Committee's next decision on interest rates is due Wednesday, and Big Tech giants with a combined market capitalization of over $10 trillion are due to report earnings. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) will go on Wednesday, and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. The Fed is unlikely to surprise. The market has set about a 2% probability of a cut in the federal funds rate come July 30, according to CME FedWatch. Ed Yardeni and William Pesek of Yardeni Research believe rates will remain unchanged, they wrote Monday, though they expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-decision press conference to be "relatively dovish," raising the perceived odds of a September cut. (For now, they said, they're in the "none-and-done camp" for 2025.) S&P 500 companies on are track to report second-quarter year-over-year earnings growth of more than 6%, according to FactSet. The pressure is on the part of the Magnificent 7 posse reporting this week to surprise to the upside, either with their respective results or their outlooks, given how much weight they carry in the broad market index: Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) have accounted for almost half of the S&P 500's gain this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple has dragged. So far this reporting season, S&P 500 companies are showing "mixed results," per FactSet's John Butters. While the percentage of S&P companies surprising on the upside, 80%, is above five- and 10-year averages, the magnitude of those surprises remains below historical averages. "The capitulatory price action and EPS estimate cuts we saw in April of this year around Liberation Day represented the end of a rolling earnings recession that began in 2022," Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note published Monday. "Now, we appear to be transitioning to a rolling recovery backdrop," he said.

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming TradFi’s Settlement Layer — Here’s Why

Time Published: 2025-07-28T19:00:49Z

Ethereum is quietly transforming from a hub of speculative activity into the foundational settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). With its secure infrastructure, growing regulatory alignment, and network effects, ETH is proving it can securely and efficiently handle large-scale institutional settlements. In an X post, crypto trader MoonKing recently highlighted a significant trend in the financial world, stating that Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). Since January, the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum have surged 20-fold, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The capital flows that were once confined to testnets and pilots are now moving decisively into production-level deployments on the ETH mainnet. This transition is supported by real yield and a growing regulatory traction, which together are driving greater institutional confidence. The leading institutions, like BlackRock, Plume, Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Franklin Templeton, are building with a clear intent to reshape financial infrastructure by leveraging blockchain. Their focus is not just on speculative crypto trading but on bringing US treasuries, credit products, and other yield-bearing assets directly into on-chain. This strategic movement signals a paradigm shift, as traditional finance is integrating with decentralized platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. With ETF momentum building, stablecoin adoption is surging, and now a wave of real-world asset (RWA) inflows is accelerating, ETH is rapidly cementing its role as core financial infrastructure, which has become harder to ignore. This convergence of on-chain finance and legacy systems marks a critical inflection point where ETH is evolving into a foundational layer for global capital markets. BlackRock’s appetite for Ethereum keeps growing. According to Ucan_Coin revealed on X, the asset management giant has continued its accumulation through the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). BlackRock now holds 2.8 million ETH, worth around $10.5 billion. In the past week, BlackRock added another $440 million to its ETH holdings, which marks one of the largest single-week institutional inflows to date. ETH has experienced a brief pullback earlier in the week but has impressively reclaimed the $3,700 to $3,800 range, which has served as a key battleground for momentum over recent weeks. The altcoin market cap continues to hold firmly above the $1.25 trillion mark, a critical psychological and technical threshold that is reinforcing bullish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The institutional inflow led by giants like BlackRock has continued to fuel confidence, and the crypto market is gaining a firmer foothold in mainstream finance.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2025/07/28/microsoft-stock-up-more-than-amazon-dont-buy-into-ai-staff-cuts/

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 01: Fired employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) take ... More personal belongings with them as they leave HHS Mary E. Switzer Memorial Building on April 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. Widespread layoffs began today across Health and Human Service Administration offices after it was announced last week that the Trump Administration plans to cut 10,000 jobs at HHS. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 01: Fired employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) take ... More personal belongings with them as they leave HHS Mary E. Switzer Memorial Building on April 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. Widespread layoffs began today across Health and Human Service Administration offices after it was announced last week that the Trump Administration plans to cut 10,000 jobs at HHS. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Title: What the techno-feudalism prophets get wrong
URL: https://mondediplo.com/2025/08/02techno-feudalism
Time Published: 2025-07-28T18:38:50Z
Full Content:
‘Cloudalists’ and digital serfs: capitalism’s new disguise? Capitalism isn’t dead, though many are rushing to write its obituary. It’s alive and kicking, powered by AI, vast data centres – and multi-billion dollar infrastructure investment. From Paris to Madrid, Rome to Berlin, a medieval spectre haunts the European left, and it’s wearing a Silicon Valley hoodie – ‘techno-feudalism’. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, de facto leader of French leftwing party La France Insoumise, has called for a tax on the profits of what he calls our new ‘digital lords’. Yet the same Mélenchon also tweets that ‘AI is not external to capitalist reality: it inscribes itself in a techno-feudalism where a few actors capture the rent.’ Profits or rent? Capitalism or feudalism? Like some stray Schrödinger’s Cat wandering the streets of Palo Alto, Mélenchon’s economy exists in two states simultaneously – dead and alive, capitalist and feudal, depending on which rhetorical convenience opens the box. In Spain, deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz rails against ‘the techno-feudalism of magnate Elon Musk’, warning that tech billionaires want to transform ‘democracies into corporate monarchies’. Italy’s Green leader Angelo Bonelli accuses that same billionaire of erecting ‘an autocratic neo-feudalism’, urging the country to choose ‘Musk or democracy’. This outbreak of techno-feudal theatrics is hilariously mistimed, arriving in the middle of the most obscene, AI-fuelled capitalist orgy since the Gilded Age. During Trump’s Gulf tour in May 2025, he secured massive US-bound investments – Saudi Arabia committed $600bn, Qatar $1.2tn and the UAE $1.4tn, with much of it (if it ever materialises) earmarked for AI infrastructure. (This is on top of $1tn Japan promised back in February.) When OpenAI’s Sam Altman floated his $7tn fundraising fantasy last year, it felt like performance art. Now it looks more like a distinct lack of ambition. This AI spending tsunami has engulfed all of Big Tech: Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon alone are injecting $320bn into AI infrastructure in 2025, up from $246bn last year. Oracle signed $48bn in new contracts in a single quarter. (…) Evgeny Morozov (1) McKenzie Wark, Capital is Dead: Is This Something Worse?, Verso, London, 2019.

(4) Yanis Varoufakis, Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism, Bodley Head, London, 2023. (5) Inconveniently for Varoufakis, Amazon’s big bet on Alexa hardly paid off, with the company announcing hundreds of layoffs in the Alexa division earlier this year. (6) Even if we left books aside and looked at online data that was fed into LLMs – eg discussions among programmers about how to solve particular problems related to software development – we would discover that most of them wrote those posts while employed by capitalist enterprises. (7) This belief in the possibility of honest competition makes him sound like the German ordoliberal economists who sabotaged his career as Greece’s minister of finance. (8) The best account of capitalist competition is to be found in Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises, Oxford University Press, 2016. (9) In his alternative conception of techno-feudalism, Cédric Durand explicitly recognises this violent side of capitalist competition, even invoking the writings of Thorstein Veblen on sabotage. However, he ends up seeing this as an aberration in capitalist praxis rather than the most essential constitutive part of it.

Title: Elon Musk is going founder mode on Tesla's $16.5 billion chip deal with Samsung
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-stock-chips-deal-tesla-elon-musk-founder-mode-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-28T17:26:29Z
Full Content:
Two particular lines in Elon Musk's posts about Tesla's new chip deal highlight just how far his "founder mode" approach extends. In this case, right down to his stated terms of Tesla's manufacturing agreement with Samsung. In a $16.5 billion deal, Samsung will produce Tesla's new AI6 chip from the manufacturing plant it is building in Taylor, Texas, which is expected to open in 2026. Located outside of Austin, Samsung's plant is close to where Musk moved in 2020, and where his company Tesla later moved in 2021. In an X post, Musk wrote that he would personally monitor the plant's activity. "This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress," Musk wrote. "And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house." In other words — "founder mode." Musk also wrote that Samsung "agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency." The Tesla CEO wrote that the deal, which Bloomberg first reported, was one of "strategic importance" for the automaker. Neither Tesla nor Samsung responded to a request for comment. Musk has long been known for taking a founder-mode approach to running his companies, an in-the-details entrepreneurial mindset that has flourished in Silicon Valley. He famously slept on the factory floor during Tesla's Model 3. He personally renamed and reorganized an entire company when taking over Twitter, now X, and he set up shop in D.C. during his DOGE era. The term "founder mode" itself, though, is newer. Its origins stem from a 2024 talk that Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky gave for the startup accelerator Y Combinator. In it, he advised against the common principle that leaders of large-scale companies should hire good employees and give them space to do their job. In a September essay titled "Founder Mode," YC cofounder Paul Graham reflected on Chesky's talk, writing that there are "things founders can do that managers can't." Graham coined the term "founder mode," describing leaders of big companies who work on the ground across the company, delving into the details at a granular level, and not just via their direct reports. Chesky later embraced the mantra named after his talk, along with much of Silicon Valley. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote on X that "we need founder mode companies in all industries." In his essay, Graham thanked a variety of tech leaders for reading early drafts, including YC CEO Garry Tan, venture capitalist Ron Conway, and Musk himself. While the terms Musk describes for Tesla's manufacturing deal and his plans to personally walk the Samsung assembly line are very "founder mode," he's not the only CEO keeping a close eye on a company's supply chain. Tim Cook rose through the ranks at Apple before becoming CEO by closely managing Apple's supply chain. The iPhone giant famously keeps a very close eye on its manufacturing partners, many of which are in China. A United airport sign photographed in 2019 and confirmed to be legitimate by the airline revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats a day for its employees to travel from San Francisco to Shanghai, a travel hub connecting to Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, which have been called "iPhone cities." The iPhone maker is also known for having a broad team of operations overseers. Samsung's new chip deal with Tesla marks a major win for its foundry business. As of 1 p.m. in New York, the company's stock price was up 6.8%. And while Tesla's assembly line workers have experienced Elon Musk's founder mode approach, it sounds like soon Samsung's will too.

Title: BlackRock CIO Warns US Must Issue ‘A Lot of Debt,’ Names One Factor That Could Trigger Stock Market Correction
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/blackrock-cio-warns-us-must-issue-a-lot-of-debt-names-one-factor-that-could-trigger-stock-market-correction/

A top BlackRock insider says that the stock market could face a correction in the near future if inflation takes off. In a new interview on Bloomberg, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, says that the US government’s fiscal situation requires it to issue “a lot” more debt. Rieder says large debt issuance makes it harder to allow longer-term yields to go up, making it more difficult to invest in T-Bills with durations longer than 10 years. And if inflation picks up, Rieder says long bonds could get hit even harder along with equities. “We’re going to issue a lot of debt. The long end is a hard place to invest. It used to be that the long end protected you against the equity market. If inflation ends up being higher, which I don’t necessarily anticipate, then what’ll happen is equities and the long end will get hit. So the long end of the yield curve today, given that you can get so much yield – if you’re an investor on the front end – the long end doesn’t become that attractive.” Looking forward, Rieder says that the US can only maintain its debt burden if it somehow manages to spur a higher GDP than the amount of debt it takes on, perhaps with the productivity expected to come from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt, you’ve got to outgrow it. So there is a plausible outcome where you get nominal GDP running at 4.5-5% if you get that interest rate down to 3%. Gosh, now you can start to de-lever but it takes a really long period of time. Listen, I think the one engine today, since we are going to have a bigger debt burden, and not only are we going to have a bigger debt burden, you have to fund it domestically, because internationalism doesn’t buy as much. As long as we grow, then you can work through it.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Trump's trade deals are set to unleash an 11% rally for stocks through year-end, Oppenheimer says

Call it a comeback. After markets went haywire in April, Trump's trade deals might have just saved the bull market, according to Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus. After lowering his year-end S&P 500 price target after the Liberation Day tariff announcements, Stoltzfus has reinstated his 7,100 target from December 2024, setting the stock market up for its third consecutive year of 20% gains. In the wake of President Donald Trump's EU and Japan trade deal, Stoltzfus believes the coast is clear for the S&P 500 to continue reaching all-time highs. "We believe that enough 'tariff hurdles' have been overcome for now to reinstate our original price target for the S&P 500 of 7100 by year-end," Stoltzfus wrote in a note on Monday morning. US exceptionalism in the stock market remains intact, Stoltzfus said. The EU trade deal Trump announced on Sunday sets tariffs of 15% on most European imports, half of the 30% Trump initially threatened. The EU has also agreed to purchase a "vast amount" of US military equipment and invest an additional $600 billion in the US. It's not just trade deals, though. US companies have held up financially through the volatility, and they're on track for a better-than-expected second quarter earnings season, Stoltzfus said. Out of the companies that have already reported second quarter earnings, 84% have beaten analyst estimates. Wall Street will be watching this week closely, as 164 companies — including the S&P 500's biggest names such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta —are set to report results. Helping the S&P 500's continued climb is the slow place of inflation. Price increases have remained relatively steady and inflation has drawn closer to the Fed's 2% target despite tariff volatility. "Monetary policy by the Fed has brought down the pace of inflation (if not yet to its 2% target level) without thus far causing a recession. This in our view is a substantial achievement considering inflation has gone from 9% in June of 2022 when the Fed recognized that inflation was out of hand to around 2.7% in June of this year," Stoltzfus wrote. Stoltzfus' 7,100 year-end price target implies a forward multiple of 25.8x and an earnings projection of $275. Investors should continue to bet on information technology, consumer discretionary, communications services, industrials, and financials, according to Stoltzfus. Jump to

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. “Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it “intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported last week. Shares of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s firm oscillated between gains and losses after the announcement. The stock closed 0.84% lower in Hong Kong on Monday. Cosco Shipping Holdings Co., the listed unit of China Cosco, was down 2.9%. Monday’s confirmation about a Chinese investor will likely help remove the obstacles that have been holding back the deal. Beijing has so far viewed the sale of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports as a threat to its interests because it includes transfer of two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the group backed by BlackRock — which China considers a proxy for American influence. Chinese authorities separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. CK Hutchison reiterated its position Monday that it “will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities.” CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement on March 4, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. While it may initially sound like positive news, restricting the group to a few potentially strategic buyers means limited competition in the price discovery process for the asset, according to Ke Yan, head of research at DZT Research in Singapore. “Hence, the deal may not fetch the best price that the company hopes for,” he said. Investors have in recent weeks flocked back to CK Hutchison amid optimism that the 96-year-old Li will seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. It didn’t help that President Donald Trump billed the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

July 28, 2025 10:20 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Will AGI Take Nvidia Stock To $300?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Could Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) reach $300 in the next two years? There’s a strong possibility. How? Consider this, just about three months ago, at the end of April 2025, Nvidia stock was trading at around $95 levels and presently trades at close to $174 per share. The stock is also up roughly 4x over the past two years. Let’s look at valuations. Nvidia stock trades at about 40x consensus FY’26 earnings. Is this pricey?Not really. Especially if you consider the company's steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia's formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. And if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) becomes even partially realized over the next few years, the demand for high-performance computing could soar exponentially. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia's revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $300 stock price. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las ... More Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) More Demanding Workloads, AGI Can Drive Revenue Nvidia's revenues grew by almost 2x over the last 12 months, while posting an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years - its revenues could move from around $131 billion in FY'25 to around $334 billion by FY'27 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Besides this, Nvidia recently indicated that it received assurances from the Trump administration allowing it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after facing a ban around April. This marks a significant win for the company, as it preserves access to a major and fast-growing AI market. More importantly, AI is expected to evolve from its current form - writing text, generating images - to more general intelligence. While the timeline is not certain, the goal is to get AI to reason, plan, learn new tasks without retraining. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could conduct scientific research, generate novel insights, or design entire products on its own. This could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across industries and some models suggest this could push global GDP growth from low single digits to over 20% annually. ((The Economist)) As the world moves closer to AGI, Nvidia could stands to benefit enormously. AGI systems are expected to require massive computational resources to train and run, considerably exceeding today’s models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the industry standard for powering such workloads. AGI could not just be the next industrial revolution, it could be much bigger and Nvidia’s chips could be right at the heart of it. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia Stock To Crash In 2025? Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. Net Margins Will Remain Thick Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia's margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY'19 to over 51% in FY'25 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia's launch of pricier higher-end products such as the latest Blackwell chips are offset by potentially higher costs and competition in the lower-end of the market from the likes of AMD. With margins remaining flat and revenue rising 2.5x, we could see earnings rise 2.5x. Looking for an alternative AI play: Could AI contender AMD see a lift ahead of earnings? Strong Results Could Mean Earnings Multiples Hold Up Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 16x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 40x now to about 16x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 28x looks quite likely. For perspective, Apple - a company that is growing at low single-digits - trades at 30x. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock by 1.7x within the next two years or so a real possibility, translating into a price of over $300 per share. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. While Nvidia stock could have massive upside, it comes with risks and considerable volatility. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine

DevOps.com Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine By: Alan Shimel on July 28, 2025 We may have just witnessed the closing of one of the most iconic chapters in modern tech. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently stated that the company is transforming from a “software factory” into an “intelligence engine.” This came on the heels of another round of layoffs — with now over 7% of Microsoft’s workforce having been laid off recently — even as the company continues to report strong earnings. The implications of Nadella’s statement are far more profound than just a catchy metaphor for AI adoption. This may be the official end of the era Marc Andreessen launched when he declared “software is eating the world” and anointed every company a “software company.” Well, here we are. The world has been thoroughly chewed up and digested by software. Mission accomplished. Now what? We’re entering a new epoch — one where the core differentiator isn’t your software, it’s your intelligence. Not just artificial intelligence, but your organization’s ability to harness data, interpret it in real time, and act — autonomously, contextually and continuously. The software itself, once the crown jewel of digital transformation, is on the verge of being commoditized by the very intelligence it enabled. Why? Because increasingly, AI is writing the software. GitHub Copilot. Google Gemini Code Assist. Meta’s Code Llama. Even legacy enterprise players are integrating generative AI tooling to auto-generate workflows, scripts, tests and documentation. When AI can write, test, optimize and deploy software faster and better than a team of engineers, you start to ask: Is the code really the product, or is the intelligence behind it what actually matters? The answer is becoming clear. Software is no longer the endgame — it’s the delivery vehicle for intelligence. This transformation won’t just tweak job descriptions or shift a few budget lines. It’s going to shake corporate foundations like a 9.0 mega-quake. If your business model depends on proprietary code, you’re in trouble. If your engineering team is still grinding through feature requests by hand while your competitor has deployed autonomous agents to build, test and launch new capabilities in hours — game over. For large enterprises, the shift to intelligence engines means reorganizing around knowledge, not departments. Data pipelines will matter more than dev pipelines. Insight velocity will matter more than release velocity. The companies that succeed will be the ones that can build, refine, and deploy intelligence continuously — not just quarterly software updates. For SMBs, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. AI-enabled tools are leveling the playing field in a way we haven’t seen since the rise of cloud computing. A five-person startup can now compete with a Fortune 500 in terms of feature velocity, user experience and even customer support. Intelligence, not size, will be the ultimate force multiplier. And for the much-prophesied “one-person company” — yes, the age is dawning. With agentic AI handling coding, marketing, legal review, customer service and data analysis, a solopreneur can run a digitally native, globally available business without hiring a single employee. This isn’t just about flipping a switch or adding “AI” to your quarterly roadmap. Becoming an intelligence engine is a deliberate journey — and there are signs that mark the way: 1. Data-first mindset: Intelligence engines treat data as the core asset. They prioritize collecting high-quality, domain-specific data, and build the infrastructure to pipeline, label, refine and retrieve it for machine learning and decision automation. 2. Agentic workflows: Static automation is out. Dynamic, self-improving workflows powered by autonomous agents are in. These agents don’t just execute — they learn, adapt and optimize. 3. Continuous intelligence delivery: Think CI/CD, but for insights. Intelligence engines ship insights to decision-makers and operational systems on a real-time basis. 4. Synthetic workforce: Human labor is augmented—or even replaced—by synthetic workers: AI agents, copilots, bots and LLMs embedded into every facet of the business. 5. Organizational un-siloing: The intelligence engine operates horizontally across functions. Sales, marketing, ops and IT share a common data and intelligence backbone. Let’s be clear: software factories delivered immense value. But they were always limited by human throughput. Intelligence engines are unbounded by those constraints. An intelligence engine doesn’t just launch a product; it learns from the market response in real time and updates pricing, targeting, messaging, and UX on the fly. It doesn’t need a quarterly planning meeting to shift direction — it sees signals in the data and pivots autonomously. It doesn’t just automate workflows; it optimizes outcomes based on multidimensional, real-time feedback. The compounding advantage of this model is hard to overstate. Companies that reach intelligence engine status will move faster, serve smarter, and scale leaner than anything we’ve seen before. We’re already seeing the early adopters — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta — aligning their entire business models around intelligence-first infrastructure. But you don’t need hyperscaler resources to join the club. Thanks to open-source LLMs, accessible vector databases, and SaaS AI copilots, the tools are in reach for nearly everyone. The next 12–24 months will separate the true transformers from the late-stage digital dinosaurs. The tipping point will come when intelligence engines can fully replace not just manual workflows, but decision-making at scale. If you’re a technology leader, you need to ask yourself: Are we still building software factories when we should be engineering intelligence? This doesn’t mean gutting your dev team or replacing your engineers with bots overnight. But it does mean evolving your architecture, culture and processes to put intelligence — not just functionality — at the center of your strategy. At Techstrong, we’ll be watching this trend unfold across all our platforms — DevOps.com, Security Boulevard, Cloud Native Now, Platform Engineering,Digital CxO, and of course, Techstrong.ai. We’ll bring you the stories, strategies and signals of the companies making the leap from factory floor to intelligence engine. Software may have eaten the world — but intelligence is about to rewrite the recipe. Stay tuned.

Stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the U.S. and EU reach a trade deal; Samsung will produce AI chips for Tesla (TSLA) at a Texas facility in a $16.5 billion deal; Alibaba (BABA) unveils new AI glasses set to rival those from Meta Platforms (META); and Nike (NKE) shares are moving higher after JPMorgan upgrades the footwear maker's stock on momentum for global orders. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are moving higher as investors digest the latest trade deal between the U.S. and EU, which sent global stocks mostly higher. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are up 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, after the indexes ended last week at fresh all-time closing highs. Futures associated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average are 0.1% higher as the index hovers near its all-time high set last December. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is edging lower at just below $119,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is ticking higher. Oil futures are trading higher by more than 1%. Gold futures are little changed. The U.S. and the European Union reached a trade deal Sunday that will set a 15% tariff on goods from the 27-nation bloc, half the rate that was set to take effect Aug. 1. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal, which also includes an EU commitment to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more in the country than current levels. The EU will not charge a tariff on U.S. goods. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced in a post on his X network that Samsung Electronics will produce artificial intelligence semiconductors for the automaker in a new Texas facility. Samsung had disclosed the deal to make the AI6 chip for a "large global company" was worth more than $16.5 billion. Musk said that Samsung is currently making the AI4 chip for Tesla, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) will make the AI5. Tesla shares are moving nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. Alibaba (BABA) unveiled a pair of AI-powered smart glasses as the Chinese e-commerce giants seeks to compete with the likes of Meta Platforms (META) in the wearable devices market. Alibaba's Quark AI Glasses "support hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription," the company said. Meta announced it would release AI-powered glasses this summer with sunglasses maker Oakley. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba are 1.5% higher in premarket trading. Nike (NKE) shares are about 4% higher in premarket trading after JPMorgan analysts upgraded the footwear maker's stock to "overweight" on momentum in global orders. JPMorgan also raised its earnings per share estimates for Nike's fiscal 2026 and 2027 for the first time since downgrading the stock to "neutral" in June 2024. Late last month, Nike stock soared after it beat fiscal fourth-quarter estimates amid CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan to return to sales growth.

Title: Leading trainer Edward O’Grady dies aged 75
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/racing/2025/07/28/leading-trainer-edward-ogrady-dies-aged-75/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T11:53:47Z
Full Content:
Edward O’Grady, one of Ireland’s leading racehorse trainers over the last 50 years, has died aged 75. Based in Ballynotty, Co Tipperary, O’Grady trained his first Cheltenham Festival winner in 1974 and went on to enjoy 18 victories in all at National Hunt racing’s ultimate meeting. Most prominent among them was Golden Cygnet, a spectacular winner of the Supreme Novices Hurdle in 1978, who looked to have the racing world at his feet only to sustain fatal injuries in a fall just weeks later. O’Grady started training in 1972 and saddled his first winner, Vibrax, at Gowran Park in January of that year. He took over the license from his father Willie, who had just died. It meant O’Grady, who attended school at Blackrock College in Dublin, had to leave university without finishing a veterinary degree. He was in the spotlight due to the famous Gay Future controversy in 1974 when the horse of that name was at the centre of a gambling coup by an Irish betting syndicate. O’Grady was later played by Pierse Brosnan in the film ‘Murphy’s Stroke’ based on the matter. He was also instrumental in introducing the then bookmaker and gambler JP McManus to racehorse ownership. In 1982 the pair combined to win at Cheltenham with Mister Donovan. McManus backed the horse and later admitted: “He was needed!” O’Grady was champion National Hunt trainer in Ireland for four years between 1977 and 1980. He flirted with switching his attentions to the flat but returned to the jumps to some effect with star names such as Nick Dundee, Back In Front and Sound Man. A statement issued by his family through Horse Racing Ireland on Monday said: “It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of Edward O’Grady, who passed away peacefully yesterday evening at St James’s Hospital, surrounded by his family. “Edward was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also one of the most respected and successful racehorse trainers of his generation. “Over the course of an extraordinary career that spanned more than five decades, Edward trained just shy of 1,700 winners under rules. His name became synonymous with Irish National Hunt racing, and he was a formidable force at Cheltenham and across the racing world. “Beyond the winners and the headlines, Edward was a man of deep intelligence, sharp wit, and remarkable warmth. He had friends on every continent, a story for every occasion, and a lifelong passion for the sport, the hunting field and everything equestrian.” O’Grady’s second wife, Maria, died in a fall while out hunting in 2017. He is survived by their daughters, Mimi and Rosie Mae, as well as his older children, Jonathan, Amber and Lucy.

HOPE_16 Opening Ceremonies It all starts Friday morning. Join us as we make sure everything works before another HOPE is unleashed on everyone. Activism, Hactivism, and the Law Alex Muentz Protest has become more important and more dangerous in the U.S. It's harder to know where the line is between safe, lawful protest and actions that can get you sanctioned, arrested, or deported. Alex will discuss how to assess the risks you face in online and in-person protests, ranging from pickets to dropping docs. Aging Cyber Safely Laura Sang Hee Scherling, Josefina Piddo This presentation asks how we can better care for our older adults and improve cybersecurity awareness training and policies with their needs in mind. American adults over the age of 60 filed over 100,000 cybercrime-related complaints to the FBI in 2023 and experienced losses amounting to $3.2 billion. Older adults are the most vulnerable to cybercrime, and studies have found they feel ashamed to disclose having been victims. Although important initiatives exist, such as AllState's training sessions on cyber safety and AARP's free fraud helpline, there's a noticeable shortage in relevant resources. This research examines emerging cybersecurity awareness resources and policies supporting older adults, drawing from interviews with FINRA and the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). It also presents findings from the cybersecurity awareness initiative founded by the presenters: the Cyber Care Institute, recently introduced to four organizations and over 100 students in New York City. AI Is Undermining Our Privacy. What Can We Do About It? Robert Stribley We've been grappling with evolving issues around online privacy for years now, but the recent burst in use of AI or LLMs (large language models) has quickly introduced new and sometimes alarming privacy concerns for both users and those creating AI experiences to consider. This talk will take a look at six specific areas where AI is undermining privacy and discuss what, if anything, we can do about them. The six areas to be discussed are: lack of transparency with data sharing, accidental exposure of personal data, reversing data anonymization, deceptive design patterns, AI listening in everywhere, and malicious misuse of AI. To end on a constructive note, eight guidelines that designers and developers can follow to ensure they're focusing on privacy when working with AI will be discussed. Aphantasia: A Personal Reflection Dr. Earl Brown Imagine a mind without mental images, where "picture this" has no meaning. Aphantasia - the inability to form mental images - is a little-known, rare condition that affects around one to four percent of the population. In this presentation, Earl will talk about aphantasia and how it has impacted his professional life as a pathologist and a teacher with more than 35 years of experience. He will explore its impact - both good and bad - on everyday experiences such as chess, piano, drawing, reading, memory, and learning, finally speculating on how aphantasia may affect creativity and the hacker mindset. The ARTS Open Framework Sabar Dasgupta Over the past several decades, the scientific process has relied more and more on computational analysis of data to produce digital artifacts. Fields like molecular biology, neuroscience, linguistics, and astrophysics, to name a few, have been revolutionized by this trend to the point that computational workflows are ubiquitous. Although most of these workflows are very similar at a high level - collecting data, analyzing it with code, and publishing the resulting figures - implementation details differ widely. While there exist standards such as the FAIR Guiding Principles for organizing and sharing data, there are not widely adopted standards for reliably regenerating analyses from said data, especially across compute environments. This talk presents an open framework for archived, reproducible, and transparent science (ARTS) that aims to do exactly this - by packaging data, code, and figures in containers and uploading it to a persistent, trusted, and accessible archive. Ask the EFF William Budington, Lena Cohen, Cara Gagliano, JosÃ© Martinez This year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will be returning to HOPE for a special "Ask the EFF" panel to address some of the pressing questions the hacker community has in these troubled times. Panelists will provide updates on current EFF work, including the ongoing case against the "Department" of Government Oversight, educating the public on their digital rights, organizing communities to resist ongoing government surveillance, and more. The panel will then turn it over to attendees to pose questions and receive insights on how users can protect their civil liberties online during an increasingly volatile political and world situation. ATM Hacking: Past and Present Roman Pushkin This talk explores the evolution of ATM hacking, from classic physical attacks to modern software exploits, using two real-world case studies. Roman will demonstrate how cybercriminals bypass security measures and why banks often stay silent. Attendees will see a live demo of a custom "flusher device" built for a tabletop coin dispenser (reverse-engineered from eBay), highlighting vulnerabilities in cash-handling systems. Back to Basics: Building Resilient Cyber Defenses for Multiple Use Cases Yael Grauer In spite of novel cybersecurity threats, digital security advice has remained largely unchanged in recent years. In fact, a lot of advice in response to high-profile attacks doesn't actually address risks people are most likely to face. This talk will analyze several high-profile digital security concerns, whether viral advice to address it would have been effective, and what steps could be taken - both before and after the issue arises. You will hear of lessons learned from years of auditing and updating Security Planner, a digital security guide that provides customized plans based on responses to a few survey questions. The presentation will further delve into ways to segment digital security advice so that it's personalized to the individual, their devices, their technical capabilities, and the type of risks they're likely to face. Bitcoin Poker: Satoshi's Lost Game and Its Decentralized Revival Mattias Bergstrom Bitcoin v0.1.5, the last version personally coded by Satoshi Nakamoto, contains curious references to poker buried in its source code. While never officially documented, these fragments suggest that Bitcoin's original design may have envisioned more than just money; it may have included decentralized, trustless gaming. This talk will explore the historical and technical significance of these lost poker references, analyzing: What was Satoshi's intent? Was this an abandoned feature, an experiment, or an overlooked function of Bitcoin's game-theoretic design? How was poker referenced in early Bitcoin? There will be a deep dive into the code archaeology of v0.1.5 and why poker may have been included. The presentation will also include the introduction of Bitcoin Poker, a modern Rust-based reimagining of trustless, peer-to-peer poker, demonstrating how we can host fully decentralized poker games without a centralized server, use multi-signature escrows for provably fair betting and payouts, ensure post-quantum security for long-term cryptographic safety, and implement a sidechain execution model to handle high-frequency transactions without bloating the main chain. Bitpart: 5-In-1 Platform for Activism Over Signal Josh King Signal is one of the most critical tools we have for secure communication amongst activists, journalists, and human rights defenders. As of 2024, Signal has over 70 million active users and over 220 million downloads, with no signs of slowing down. With the global rise of the far-right and corresponding attacks on human rights, the ability to securely organize via Signal against these forces is more important than ever. To that end, Throneless Tech has embarked on an in-depth research project that resulted in the creation of Bitpart: a Rust-based software platform that allows for the creation of dynamic organizing tools on top of Signal. Depending on the end-users' tech capacity, Bitpart can be run on organizers' own self-hosted servers or through Throneless-hosted servers. The project builds on experience gained from past Signal chatbot projects, and new research conducted with targeted groups such as current organizers, activists, and journalists around the world. In this session Josh King, developer of Bitpart, will demonstrate how the platform is being used to create bots that activists can use as secure, anonymous tiplines, digital helpdesks, broadcast lists, a tool to distribute eSIMs, and a tool to share VPN download codes. Participants will come away with an understanding of how Signal can be utilized in novel ways, how to think through the threat model and risk assessment for creating secure tools for activists, and how Bitpart can be expanded upon and applied to their own communities. Both Sides of the Wire: Surveillance, Whistleblowing, and Building a Cyber Peace Movement John Kiriakou As a former CIA officer who exposed the agency's torture program, John Kiriakou paid the price with his freedom. In addition to disclosing wrongdoing, he understands surveillance from the inside. This talk brings together that firsthand knowledge with a challenge to the hacker community: we must pursue a cybersecurity model rooted in cooperation, transparency, and peace rather than conflict. This talk will explain how today's digital ecosystems - including both software and hardware - are vulnerable not only to technical compromise but also to political manipulation. The threats we face are not just from malicious actors or hostile governments, but from within our own systems. Co-opted code, opaque procurement processes, and surveillance-by-design continue to erode public trust. It is time to reclaim the hacker ethos and direct it toward a global cyber peace movement. Here you will learn why hackers, technologists, and civil society must lead this effort, and how the only sustainable security is one built collaboratively, with integrity and purpose. Bridging the Decentralized Gap: Shared Hacker Values, Cypherpunk Roots, and the Future of Blockchains Alexander Urbelis, Phil Daian, Harry Halpin This panel will delve into the deep-rooted connections between hacker and cypherpunk culture and the evolution of Ethereum and blockchain technology, tracing their shared emphasis on decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles. By revisiting the historical context of the 1990s Crypto Wars and projects like PGP and Tor, the discussion will highlight how these early movements laid the groundwork for the vision of a trustless, user-sovereign Internet. The panel also will aim to debunk common misconceptions that associate blockchains solely with scams or speculation, showcasing real-world applications such as the Ethereum Name Service and privacy-preserving technologies, while emphasizing the ecosystem's pivot towards public goods and accessibility. Ultimately, the conversation will underscore the enduring, collaborative vision of both hacker and blockchain communities - advancing censorship resistance, user empowerment, financial privacy, and a decentralized digital future. Build a Tech Community in Your Neighborhood, One Hackathon at a Time William Hutson This talk chronicles the journey of creating a vibrant tech community through short, accessible two-hour mini-hackathons that lower barriers to participation. The speaker shares their experience of building Flushing Tech's successful bi-weekly hackathon program, and provides a practical roadmap for you to try this at home in your own neighborhood. Leave with actionable guidelines for starting similar initiatives that emphasize the importance of creating an inclusive environment that welcomes participants of all skill levels while maintaining enough technical focus to drive meaningful project development. This talk is ideal for community organizers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in fostering grassroots innovation in their local area. Bureaucracy Hacking - Creating Organizational Exploit Chains for Good Adam L. Hesch At their core, all bureaucracies are, fundamentally, information systems, containing the ability to store information, compute information, and share information over a network. This means they all can be hacked. In this funny, enriching, and ultimately inspirational talk, the concept of "bureaucracy hacking" will be discussed as a way to make a difference in any organization of any size, even (perhaps most especially) when you feel like "just a cog in the machine." The talk will be suitable for a novice audience of any background, with high level references to traditional information security, hacking, and of course social engineering principles. What will make it unique and interesting will be particular emphasis on the exploitation of the emergent and unique properties of bureaucracies. It will be most actionable by young, idealistic entrants into the workforce. And, it may yet inspire the younger versions of ourselves inside each of us that our (warranted) cynicism has led us to ignore or forget (at our peril). Stories will come from the speaker's (and others') experiences at organizations like Meta, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Navy, and others. It is intended as a rebuttal to, and toolkit for, countering "Pournelle's iron law of bureaucracy." Claw Back Your Data From Big Tech With Cyd Micah Lee, redshiftzero Tech platforms can't be trusted. Oligarchs and billionaires want you to keep giving your data to their Big Tech companies for free so they can sell it and manipulate you into believing nonsense. In this talk, the Lockdown Systems collective will introduce Cyd, their open source desktop app that makes it easy for people to reclaim control over their data from Big Tech. Giving users actual control over their data is challenging when dealing with hostile, enshittified tech platforms like X and Facebook. Cyd bypasses all of that though by putting the user in the driver's seat: it runs on the user's own computer, from their own IP address, and it works by automating a web browser on their behalf - and sometimes relying on APIs, when they're available, free, and don't suck. It doesn't share any access to your accounts or your data with the Lockdown Systems collective. Attendees will learn how Cyd works under the hood, how you can use it, and how you can contribute to building tools that challenge the dominance of Big Tech. Communication and Movement in Internet Shutdown Protests: Rethinking Mesh Messaging Cora Rowena Ruiz 2024 was the worst year for Internet shutdowns ever recorded, with nearly 296 documented events across 54 countries. Frequently imposed during protests and times of unrest, shutdowns are commonly used as a tactic to suppress dissent and restrict communication. Mesh messaging is widely hailed as a potential workaround, yet these tools are generally considered unreliable, untrusted, and ultimately go unused. Mesh systems depend heavily on the spatial relationships between nodes, but existing research on how people move and communicate in protest settings is sparse. This talk explores a holistic approach to mesh tool design, grounded in qualitative firsthand experiences to build effective blackout-resistant mesh tools. Computational Techniques for Making Karaoke Harder Jamie Brew Robot Karaoke is a live comedy show that swaps lyrics with fragments of text drawn from a catalog of esoteric datasets (quora questions, web banner ads, tax forms, and more) to create and sing never-before-sung karaoke songs. This talk covers how the data is sourced, how the songs are phonetically annotated, and how the show is run and the core software (the Weird Algorithm) developed. The presentation will end with a demo of the future of karaoke. The Computer Underground Scene - Past, Present, and Future Netspooky (Phrack / HCC), TMZ ( Phrack / tmp.Out), Skyper (THC / ex-Phrack), John Threat (Masters of Deception), Bill Budington (Electronic Frontier Foundation) This is a brainstorming session together with the audience. The panel will talk and unravel a bit about the past and present, and try to find a shared vision of where we are or should be heading. Counter-Surveillance as Activism: Using Cameras Against State Violence in Israel/Palestine Aman Abhishek Palestinian, Israeli, and international anti-occupation activists in Israel/Palestine have been using cameras to deter and document violence from Israeli security forces and settlers for around two decades. Human rights organizations first started distributing cameras in the mid-2000s to facilitate documentation, and today, essentially every anti-occupation activist in the West Bank and Jerusalem carries some combination of video cameras, smartphones, and body cameras to deter and document state-settler violence. The activists also take it upon themselves to take the videos to journalists, human rights organizations, courts, and elsewhere; recently, this activism was the focus of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. This talk will describe how activists organize, what happens to the footage, how this activism changed after October 7th, and what this all means for thinking about counter-surveillance as a strategic response to state violence. Cracking Enigma: A Chronology of Cryptographic Breakthroughs Brais Macknik-Conde The Enigma machine was a sophisticated encryption device used by Nazi Germany during World War II. Its mechanical design utilized three rotors that scrambled plaintext into complex ciphertext, with additional layers of security from unique internal settings. However, inherent weaknesses and poor operational procedures left it vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The first successful attacks on Enigma were conducted by Polish mathematicians in the early 1930s. By exploiting repeating message indicators and rotor cycle patterns, they deduced rotor wirings and constructed replica Enigma machines. Their breakthroughs enabled systematic decryption until German countermeasures in 1938 forced new approaches. Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park refined these methods, pioneering statistical techniques and mechanical computation to accelerate decryption. Techniques such as Banburismus and the Good-Turing estimation method were created under Turing's leadership. The development of the Bombe machine allowed rapid elimination of incorrect rotor settings, enabling the Allies to decipher vast amounts of enemy communication. This presentation will focus on history and cryptography, examining how breaking Enigma provided critical intelligence that shaped Allied strategies and shortened the war by an estimated two years, saving millions of lives in one of humankind's most significant intelligence operations. CRXaminer - Deep Dive Into Chrome Extensions (Plus Tool) Mark El-Khoury You spend your time configuring HTTP headers and hardening your containers. Meanwhile your CFO just downloaded a Chrome extension to make the font in Gmail Comic Sans. What are Chrome extensions, exactly? This talk will dive into details, including format, contents, static analysis with custom rules, threat modeling (when does this even matter?), and some of the unique challenges of building a security scanner. A tool will be demoed that has just been released for this: CRXaminer (crxaminer.tech). You will learn how you can immediately start using it. Dark Web Digger: Modular Scraping for Dark Web Intel Samantha Stortz, Dominick Foti Dark web forums are a major resource for the hacking community and play a large role in the spread of information, data leaks, tools, services, and related transactions. While it is common for users to keep similar usernames and identifiers across different forums to maintain their credibility, these users often need to create or change accounts. The prototype presented here looks to tie anonymized accounts to the same user, as they will likely have similar language usage, post content, tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). The presenters developed a modular web scraper that can extract data from forums and store said data for analysis. They explore opportunities to leverage machine learning techniques to automate and enhance the process of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysis in the future. This includes using natural language processing (NLP) to digitally fingerprint users based on speech patterns, trend detection between users and forums, and even a chatbot to assist the tool's users in finding specific information. The project provides analysts with a wholistic view of how users interact on these forums, making it more functional and versatile. Data Autonomy: Counter-Surveillance Strategies for Civil Society Marlon Kautz The surveillance apparatus in the West is going critical, and civil society is not prepared for the fallout. Political leadership is explicitly targeting NGOs and social movements using surveillance capabilities that have been perfected over the past decade. This talk will evaluate the merits and limitations of different counter-surveillance approaches from the vantage point of grassroots organizers, and go beyond the stock advice of "use Signal and a VPN" to offer proposals for defeating state surveillance through technical infrastructure development and political organizing. Design for Neurodiversity: Creating Neuro-Inclusive Spaces Dorothy Howard This talk will explore the concept of neurodiversity and its implications for designing events and spaces with neurodivergent people's diverse needs in mind. The neurodiversity paradigm promotes embracing neurological differences, emerging from the autistic rights and disability justice movements of the 1990s. Accessibility guides and resources rarely focus on neuro-inclusive design. The presentation will highlight strategies for creating neuro-inclusive environments informed by research in education, including examples such as low-sensory rooms in libraries and conferences. Attendees will be encouraged to reflect on how neuro-inclusive design can benefit the communities they engage with. DIY Police Scanner With SDRs and Open Source Software nop Police accountability requires transparency, but access to relevant information is frequently hindered by collaborators in government or the police themselves. Fortunately there is one source of info we can take into our own hands: their radios. Police in the United States largely use the digital, trunked radio system "Project 25." We can listen in to this using spare computers, a few Software Defined Radios (SDRs), and open source software. Even better, we can go far beyond what very simple broadcastify-style dispatch streams offer, like having our own archives of radio traffic. Based on an actual system that sees real-world use, this talk will cover how to set up your very own DIY police scanner. Ansible playbooks and supporting scripts to streamline the process will be released, and practical tips and lessons for real-world applications of such a system will be covered. Eco-Hacking Desire: The Intersection of Pornography, Sex, and Environmental Impact Jasmin Hagendorfer This talk explores the intersection of desire and sustainability, examining how even our most intimate moments leave an environmental footprint. The concept of sexecology, coined by Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, bridges environmentalism and sexuality in creative ways. From solar-powered vibrators to eco-friendly sex toys, the session delves into the often overlooked world of green sex tech and eco-erotic practices. Key questions explored will include: What are the true environmental costs of online pornography? How sustainable is our streaming culture and AI technologies? Can DIY pleasure practices be a form of political activism? What role does ethical pornography play in envisioning a better future? The discussion will also cover energy consumption, server loads, and the hidden costs behind virtual acts of desire. The focus is not to shame desire, but to empower it with awareness, curiosity, and hacker ethics. The speaker, a feminist activist and artist, aims to foster a dialogue about how digital intimacy can become more visible, accountable, and hackable. This talk invites the hacker community and beyond to collaborate in rethinking the infrastructures behind online pleasure and to explore ways of making the environmental impact of these systems more transparent. Esolangs as a Hacker Folk Art Daniel Temkin The most important computational art is happening far from museums, immersive art "experiences," and the smoldering ruins of NFT platforms. Esolangs, like demos and code golf, are hacker folk art, born entirely outside the art world, yet beginning to get wider attention as more digital artists and poets contribute to the form. This should not be a surprise with the critical work it has done to explore our relationship with technology, the politics of computing, the aesthetics of code, among many other subjects. This talk will present esolangs, not as a loose collection of language associated by algorithmic complexity, but a social history of how each language influenced the next, drawing from ten years of interviews for the blog esoteric.codes. It will look at esolangs as more than technical wizardry and consider aesthetics for this form that often pretends to eschew aesthetics entirely. Expanding the BioArtBot Color Palette - A Beginner's guide to Lab Automation and Biosafety Danny Chan bioartbot.org/ is a project for encouraging curiosity in microbiology and lab automation through creative expression. It is an open source project built on a pipetting robot that draws user submitted pixel art by placing colored bacteria on agar. Using the story of the BioArtBot development as a guide, this talk will provide a basic overview of the technologies (hardware, software, and wetware) implemented in the BioArtBot. It will describe how lab automation is used in biotech companies, how it might be used by amateur/community investigators, and how the BioArtBot is an interesting framework to contribute to if you are looking to skill-up in lab automation. It will also describe how the living pigments for this project were created and sourced, how you might create/source your own, and the amazing diversity of living chemical refineries that are bacteria. So if you're interested in robots and bacteria, come find out how we can command our tireless inorganic creations to deposit aesthetically pleasing arrangements of the ancient form-factor of all life. Exploiting Emergent Property-Based Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models David Kuszmar As AI technology expands across both benign and malicious applications, our understanding of the attack surface must evolve to account for emergent properties in complex systems. In large language models, these emergent behaviors create novel classes of vulnerabilities that are not only unpatched, but largely unrecognized. By systematically manipulating the model's limited perception of reality, attackers can induce cascading failures that go far beyond traditional filter bypasses, exposing fundamental weaknesses in the internal logic and contextual binding of these systems. This session will unpack how these vulnerabilities work, walk through real examples, and explore the far-reaching implications for AI security, governance, and safety. The Five Pillars for Rewriting History and Culture Alexander J. Urbelis, Daniel Nowak, Roel Schouwenberg From printing press to blockchain, technological advances reshape historical narratives across five pillars: finance, governance, faith, communications, and consciousness. Influential entities employ sophisticated cyber and information solutions to manipulate resources and power. Governments, corporations, and NGOs manage narratives, shaping opinion and obscuring truths as they manage perception. Religious groups use digital platforms to spread doctrine, blurring traditional faith boundaries. Social media and emerging technologies amplify disinformation worldwide. These operations exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, reshaping collective memory and fueling evolving consciousness. This talk will examine how technology-driven psychological operations can unmake historical canons, normalizing new realities and marginalizing dissent. The presenters will highlight ethical dilemmas and stress the urgent need for transparency, critical awareness, and decentralization across all pillars. Lastly, they will offer recommendations for how the individual can remain resilient in the face of these existential threats and multifaceted Manichean devils. The Free Software Movement: Where It Came From, What It Means to Me, and What It Could Mean to You Craig Topham This talk is the journey of Craig's discovery of the free software movement and how it solved his need to find a position in the fight for a better tomorrow. The hope is to inspire others to share this viewpoint of free software and to see how it is a critical factor for civilization if we want to avoid the nightmare dystopia which awaits us all if the free software movement fails. From Activism to Hacktivism: Resisting Digital Repression Gabrielle Joni Verreault, Elina Castillo-Jimnez, Jane Eklund, Ken Mayers (Moderator) This panel discussion will offer insights into the challenges faced by human rights defenders and hacktivists in today's context of intensified digital repression, including surveillance, censorship, and cyberwarfare. The three panelists will report from the frontlines, sharing their technical expertise and experiences living among activists and supporting them in their work in different countries. Topics will include hacktivism in Ukraine, disrupting surveillance in Serbia and Thailand, and tech and reproductive rights in the USA and worldwide. Each panelist will briefly share their stories and insights, and then the discussion between them and the audience will be opened. The Future of Email Is Open Dejan Å trbac, William Lessard Email is one of our most essential tools, yet it's controlled by a handful of corporations that scan, monetize, and gate-keep our communication. In this talk, the presenters will introduce OpenEmail, a ground-up re-imagining of async communication built on a radically simple, open protocol. Designed for privacy, integrity, and interoperability, OpenEmail combines end-to-end encryption; decentralized delivery; and a public, extensible architecture to give users true ownership of their communication, and developers the freedom to build on top of an open social protocol. They will explore how a spam-free, surveillance-free inbox, where messages are trustworthy by design, can reclaim the Internet as a space for open, human connection, free from Big Tech. More than just a talk, this is a call to arms: to take back control of our communication and build a digital future that serves people, not profit. Getting Out of DOGE: A Discussion With a Former DOGE Engineer Adam Klasfeld, Sahil Lavingia The whole world has been watching as the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), the partnership between Elon Musk and the Trump administration, has worked to fulfill its pledge to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. Despite promises to the contrary, there has been very little transparency about DOGE or its operations - until now. Join Adam Klasfeld, a former MSNBC legal contributor and founder of All Rise News, as he interviews Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE engineer. This discussion aims to reveal what DOGE is really doing behind the scenes and offer the public a unique chance to ask direct questions to someone who was there. Hackers Got Talent Jason Scott It just wouldn't be HOPE without another installment of "Hackers Got Talent." This is an opportunity for hackers from all around the planet to show off their talents in this cheeky display of hacker (and totally non-hacker) skills. Just sign up at InfoDesk and the talent you decide to share is entirely up to you. (Seriously, anything you're good at is a talent.) Hacker archivist Jason Scott will again be on hand to keep everything moving. Judging will be done by a combination of panelists and audience members. First place wins a valuable prize! Second place... we'll see. Hacking for Social Justice Danacea Vo "How can my hacking skills become a force for advancing social justice?" Those who ponder this question often know what they're up against - oppression, inequality, enshitification.... But the path toward building meaningful change can feel unclear or overwhelming. This talk draws from years of experience working alongside activists, human rights defenders, and digital organizers, and offers a practical framework for lasting, meaningful change. You'll gain social impact strategies that will help you align your technical skills with the movements and communities you care about. If you've ever felt the call to do more - with purpose, with clarity, with community - this is your invitation. Hacking Search: Kagi's Revolt Against the Ad-Tech Machine Vladimir Prelovac You know the drill: search for official travel info, get an overcharging third-party site. Look for a hotel, get a misleading aggregator. "Free" search costs you time, money, and trust. Kagi is the revolt - a paid, obsessively user-centric search engine architected to serve you, not the advertisers. This session reveals how Kagi sidesteps the surveillance model, leveraging diverse sources and AI tools (under your control) to deliver clean, customizable results. Founder Vlad Prelovac will detail the tech choices enabling genuine user agency (blocking SEO garbage, elevating trusted sources via filters), the challenge of building viable alternatives outside the ad-tech ecosystem, and the fight to restore user agency against data-hoarding monopolies. If you're tired of being the product on the web, join the resistance. Hacking the Future at Tesla Science Center Michael Caprio, Jeffrey Velez, Ed Wilson The year 2026 marks the 170th birthday of Nikola Tesla and will also be the year that the grounds of his Wardenclyffe laboratory will at last open to the public. Learn about the latest goings-on from Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe detailing their visitor center renovation and opening; development of their amateur radio station and radio club; expansion of their public and educational programming with space science courses, events, and hackathons; a future hackerspace; and more exciting projects! Hacking the Tech-Industrial Complex: Learning to See Invisible Systems Seth Godin The author of more than 20 international bestsellers gives us an inside view of the systems that drive our culture. Every dominant system works to maintain itself, and we can find strategies and stories that push to make things better. Hack the Violin Part 2: The Advanced Stuff - This Time There's AI Andrew Morican, Ebmbat This is a follow-on from "Hack the Violin: A Hacker's Approach to Learning, Playing, and Teaching the Violin" from Hope XV. This will be a look at technology, most notably AI and hacking the violin. You will learn what's out there and what the presenters were able to achieve with their own AI project regarding practicing and engagement. You will also learn about AI with live performance and creation, as well as AI and string sampling - and see how sampling may be altering the stringscape. Hardware Hacking Meets Art: How Movie Special Effects Are Made Davis DeWitt Step into the world of movie magic with Davis DeWitt, a filmmaker, inventor, and former Mythbuster and learn how combining hardware hacking with art creates objects that do more than function: they evoke emotion and tell stories. From blowing up cars to building robots with personality, this talk will explore why it's important to tackle projects that blur the lines between disciplines. HOPE_16 Badge - No Badge, No Problem Victoria Joh, Vinicius Fortuna Electronic badges have become a focal point of hacking conferences and key to growing the immersive conference experience! This talk will provide a brief history of electronic conference badges, as well as discuss the good, the badge, and the ugly from the speakers' attempt at a new and improved production run this year. Sadly, while there will not be a new production of the improved HOPE badge in time for the con to be shared with HOPE_16 attendees, this will still be a lively discussion of everyone's favorite badges from past hacking conferences. The design and production challenges that inevitably cropped up will be discussed in detail. The struggle to produce a working badge aligning both funding and functionality is real. This year has been no exception, with various uncertainties such as tariffs and geopolitical norms at play. Despite the challenges, many lessons have been learned. This is an opportunity to plan for a future run, share experiences with others, and get more interested individuals to join the team and get involved. How a Handful of Location Data Brokers Actively Track Millions, and How to Stop Them Bill Budington, Lena Cohen In the past year, a number of investigations have revealed the outsized role of a few select companies in gathering, storing, and selling the location data of millions of devices - and by extension people - worldwide. These companies largely use technologies which power the online advertising industry in order to collect and disseminate this data. To make matters worse, this data has been both provided to private investigators on the mere assurance that they plan to work with law enforcement, and has been subject to data breaches which put the privacy of millions at risk. This talk will elaborate on the technologies, data flows, and industry players which comprise this complicated ecosystem. Most importantly, it will cover some basic steps you can perform to protect yourself against the wide array of location privacy harms your device subjects you to. The presenters will show tools and techniques they've developed to allow users to take back ownership of our devices, rather than our devices owning us. How I Used and Abused LLMs to Get Top 250 on HTB Rambo Anderson-You This talk explores an experiment in giving AI system-wide access to compete on Hack The Box (HTB). The talk details the development of a semiautonomous workflow for capture the flag (CTF) competitions, involving jailbreaks, LLM switching, and hardware. Through iterative diagrams, the talk traces how the workflow evolved as the AI improved at capturing flags. This presentation considers how this CTF solving AI slop might extend to real world scenarios like penetration testing, red teaming, and bug bounty hunting. How Law Enforcement Agencies Compromise Entire Encrypted Chat Platforms Joseph Cox Law enforcement agencies compromising entire encrypted communication platforms to read peoples' messages is no longer an outlier. It is the new normal. That includes the FBI taking a tech startup called Anom and inserting its own backdoor, French authorities pushing a malicious update to tens of thousands of EncroChat devices, European cops hacking another company called Sky, or any of the increasing number of related cases. In this talk, Joseph Cox, co-founder of 404 Media and author of Dark Wire will detail police tactics, pulling from his nearly ten years of covering the encrypted phone industry. How to Be Positively Transgressive: Hacking Culture for Good Johannes Grenzfurthner (monochrom) In an era where transgression has been co-opted by reactionary forces, how can we reclaim subversion as a tool for positive change? Historically, countercultures, hackers, and artists have used disruption to challenge power structures, expose hypocrisy, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Yet today, the same methods - culture jamming, media pranks, and ideological infiltration - are increasingly wielded by ultra-right movements to erode democratic values and spread reactionary narratives. This talk will explore how we can re-hack the hacker mindset: How can we use transgressivity in ways that are constructive rather than destructive? How do we subvert without merely burning things down? Can we retool the aesthetics and tactics of countercultural rebellion to push society forward instead of backward? Through historical examples, personal experiences, and a healthy dose of mischievous strategy, this talk will try to outline actionable ways to engage in cultural hacking that disrupt oppressive systems while reinforcing community, inclusivity, and progressive values. Because giving up on the tools of subversion means surrendering the battlefield. And that, phreaky phriends, is not an option. Human Augmentation: Hacking Human Perception and Performance With Technology: Benefits and Dangers Lucas Potter, Xavier Palmer, Vivekanand Pandey Vimal Human augmentation is the idea of using technology to hack, alter, and enhance human perception and performance. Imagine being able to enhance your ability to navigate by sensing the flow of magnetic fields like a pigeon. Many industries are starting to explore human augmentation, such as space (enhancing astronauts), medical (rehabilitation), entertainment (greater immersion), military (greater performance), among others. In the first presentation, Dr. Vimal will begin by providing an overview of psychology and neuroscience research on the topics of human augmentation. Then he will share his own NASA-funded research on using sensory augmentation as a countermeasure for spatial disorientation. What dangers could arise from building a bridge between human and sensory augmentation devices that have the capability of altering human perception? This question will connect to the second presentation of the panel, where Dr. Palmer and Dr. Potter will explore how human augmentation connects to security through biocybersecurity followed by Q&A. ICEBlock and the Age of Digital Activism Joshua Aaron Learn how ICEBlock has empowered over a million users nationwide to report immigration and customs enforcement activities anonymously, despite government pushback. Discover how you can use your tech skills to drive change and advocate for causes you believe in. Plus, stick around for a Q&A session where you can interact directly with the creator! This talk will be remote due to the targeting of the speaker by the current administration. Into the Fediverse Evan Prodromou One third of Americans say that social media has negatively impacted their mental health. Almost two thirds say that social media has been bad for democracy. But the majority of us still use social media on a daily basis. We clearly need better social media - enabling user choice or even platforms built and run by the users. The Fediverse is a coalition of social networking platforms that connect together, letting users interact across platforms while maintaining their independence. Evan is one of the authors of the ActivityPub standard that drives the Fediverse. He will discuss how the Fediverse went from a dream to a reality, and how individuals and communities can start exercising control over their own social platforms. Invisible Ink of Compression XlogicX When you pop the hood of RFC 1951 (DEFLATE), there lies an interesting playground that would be otherwise unseen in the context of compression use cases. This talk will address many aspects of the ubiquitous DEFLATE compression, none of which involve compressing data! "Designer Compression" scenarios will be explored, such as blocks of DEFLATE data that can be fully ASCII printable, contain no data, buffer underflow access of nulls, and even apply forms of recursion. We will also see forensic data extraction from compressed fragments, employ difficult to detect watermarking, demo a covert channel PoC (deflate in http), and forever-cookies. The presentation style will take a high-level first pass and then dig into the technical details with the time left. Itinerant Signal Institute (Rite of Spring) Amelia Marzec "Itinerant Signal Institute" is a project that leverages open source technology to examine and communicate about land use. As we move into an era of potentially increasing climate migration, the project aims to create a network of sensors that test environmental toxins. It examines the effect of local emissions on global climate change, using small devices that test the air and soil. That information is then shared via a portal. Imagery for the project will include ritual costumes that mark the changing of seasons. The project began with visits to polluted locations in New York City, including Governors Island (a former military base) and Newtown Creek (one of the most toxic waterways), and working with the Urban Soils Institute to collect information for the project. Leading and Survival When TSHTF - A Lighthearted Look at the End of the World George Sandford There's a moment when you realize that yes, everything may actually be on fire. As individuals, we can collapse, or we can take action to at least increase the odds of a positive outcome. As leaders (managers, parents, friends), we have to hold it together, fight to create safe spaces, keep our teams motivated, and somehow find time for self-care - without letting an active adversary turn us into the human equivalent of burnt toast. This talk will explore the art of leading in the midst of chaos, drawing on a punk ethos, irreverent humor, and a sprinkling of practical advice. You'll see how to preserve diversity and inclusion when everything feels like it's falling apart, how to support your team without losing your mind, and why it's okay to cry in the shower (just not every day). Media, Vibe Coding, and the Long Tail Lydia Laurenson What is even happening in the media now? There's a resurgence of paper magazines, and now they reach a long tail of subscribers due to the powers of the Internet. At the same time, social media platforms are downgrading in complexity and Signal chats have somehow become the new social media conversation. Everything old is new again, and it's all combining and recombining with weird emergent politics and independent vibe coders. This will be a discussion of the future of media, especially as seen within alternative cultures and the weird Internet. Meshtastic Attacktastic Dave "Heal" Schwartzberg In emergencies or off-grid scenarios, Meshtastic shines, but it can crumple when adversaries go off-script. Meshtastic is an open-source platform that allows for long-range, off-grid communication through LoRa-based mesh networks. While offering powerful tools for decentralized communication, particularly in remote areas or during emergencies, Meshtastic also introduces a set of security risks that could be exploited by adversaries. This talk explores the potential vulnerabilities within Meshtastic networks, focusing on attack vectors such as physical attacks, privacy leaks, key management, and jamming. Additionally, the effectiveness of the platform's encryption and authentication mechanisms will be analyzed, offering insights into how these systems can be compromised and how users can fend off attackers. This session will include a technical breakdown of known vulnerabilities and present both simulated and real-world examples of attacks on Meshtastic networks. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to defend against these threats, hardening their mesh networks against malicious actors. Whether you're a hobbyist experimenting with off-grid communications or a security professional assessing decentralized systems, this presentation will equip you with the tools and knowledge to secure your Meshtastic devices. New Journalism: Reimagining Information Networks From the Ground Up Patrick Boehler This presentation explores how communities are developing resilient information-sharing systems that outperform traditional journalism. Drawing from research on independent journalism in China, Patrick will examine how these organic networks function as advanced social technologies that challenge conventional understanding of information distribution. The talk invites the HOPE community to reimagine information infrastructure that can withstand authoritarian control, resist corporate manipulation, and genuinely serve community needs through collaborative problem-solving and the application of security expertise in distributed systems. Not Your Private Army: On the Trail of Cyber Ops Emma Best During the past two decades, hacktivist spaces have been infiltrated and co-opted by hostile interests, ranging from state actors to political and corporate entities and entitled oligarchs. This talk examines how these outside parties have attempted to build private cyber armies and task forces through the recruitment and exploitation of gray and black hat hackers. Special focus is given to the "Anonymous" brand, Western state actors, and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. NymVPN: The First Real-World Decentralized Noise-Generating Mixnet for Anonymity Harry Halpin Nym is the first decentralized noise-generating mixnet to provision real-world network anonymity to Internet users even against nation-state adversaries. The aim here is to supersede existing VPNs in order to fight increasingly more powerful authoritarianism and surveillance. Unlike traditional centralized VPNs that can be de-anonymized by a global passive adversary - like the NSA - based on their traffic patterns, Nym adds noise ("cover traffic") to existing Internet communications. Similar to Tor, Nym routes each packet separately over a decentralized network of servers, but unlike Tor, mixes traffic and adds noise at each hop. After being introduced at HOPE five years ago, NymVPN has now shipped. NymVPN is an easy to use app for all major operating systems that makes using the Nym network as easy as using a traditional VPN for ordinary people, with both a "fast" and "anonymous" mode. The "fast" mode features speeds comparable to centralized VPNs using the same decentralized network as the mixnet, but without mixing. Via the SDK, the Nym mixnet remains free to use by hackers to build the next generation of privacy infrastructure. Off-Grid Data Running in Oppressive Regimes: The Pirate Box Project (and Sneakernet!) LambdaCalculus In today's political climate in the U.S., the Internet as we know it is in danger of becoming heavily monitored, privatized, and censored. Information may only be what the corporations and government want you to see, and it may become difficult for marginalized and poor communities to have access to free information and education that the Internet provides. But by building an off-grid, mesh networked system known as the Pirate Box, it'll become a pivotal way of being the data runner your community needs. The Pirate Box is a form of Sneakernet, and this talk will give you a brief overview of both, as well as strategic tools and ways to make a Pirate Box of your own, along with projects in the spirit of the Pirate Box. Offworld Voyage: Can Training for Mars Exploration Also Address Human Adaptation to Climate Biodevastation on Earth? Scott Beibin Elizabeth Jane Cole This talk will present the design philosophy behind Offworld Voyage, a decentralized science initiative that develops ecologically sustainable training habitats for use in simulated Mars surface exploration missions - while also solving for adaptation to extreme climate change on Earth. The Offworld Voyage M.A.R.S. Tesseract Space Analog Simulation Habitats were designed with a zero waste ethos for minimal environmental impact by inventor Scott Beibin and Michael Flood. The modular and portable structures of the habitats include: a bio-dome for cultivating organic vegan plant-based and fungi-based nutrition sources, autonomous power production, advanced waste reclamation, a science laboratory for experimentation and research, a space medicine bay, a fabrication lab for prototyping and repair, facilities for fitness and creativity as well as a kitchen and living quarters. Mission immersions incorporate a vision of the future when space has become accessible to all through the use of emerging ecologically sustainable appropriate technologies enabled by new types of egalitarian economic structures and coordination methods. Crew activities include EVA explorations in pressurized space suits outfitted with bio-sensors, 3D printed construction using regolith, utilization of open source communications tools, cooperative governance exercises and the practice of mutual aid and consensus decision-making in mission planning, problem-solving and self-sufficiency challenges in the face of extreme resource scarcity, simulated time-delayed communications, and experiments to analyze the effects of isolation on astronauts during offworld missions. The inaugural mission for the M.A.R.S. Tesseract habitats will occur in a remote desert location in late 2025. It will include the founders of the project, Scott Beibin and Elizabeth Jane Cole, who are both alumni of the Mars Desert Research Station (Mission 286) and core committee members of The Journal for Space Analog Research. Future plans for the project include the development of pressurized facilities and closed loop systems, as well as development of public goods including hardware and software for Space Analog Research and S.T.E.A.M-based educational programs. Packets Over Any Wire: Alternative Networking Mediums for Hackers Haxedalot Why limit yourself to Ethernet and Wi-Fi when every wire in your house can carry packets? This talk explores alternative physical networking technologies that exist but are often overlooked. From powerline networking (HomePlug AV/AV2) to MoCA over coaxial cables, the talk will dive into how these systems work, their encryption and security models, known exploits, and the inherent risks of non-switched cable mediums. Real-world applications, including whole-home audio and video distribution, network segmentation strategies, and the unexpected advantages of leveraging existing infrastructure will also be explored. You'll see how HDMI matrices, IP-based video distribution, and networked audio solutions like SonosNet can integrate seamlessly over alternative backbones. Segmentation techniques to isolate security cameras will also be covered. Expect deep technical insights, practical lessons from years of experimentation, and a fresh perspective on what's possible when you stop thinking of cables as just power or TV lines - and start treating them as network highways. Whether you're looking to expand connectivity in a complex environment or just want to push the limits of home networking, this talk will leave you with new tools, techniques, and ideas to explore. Phrack Magazine #72 - 40th Anniversary Release Party Netspooky, TMZ Celebrate 40 years of legendary hacking with Phrack Magazine! Netspooky and TMZ will be dropping a special hardcopy release of their magazine, packed with cutting-edge research, underground insights, and tributes to decades of digital rebellion. Don't miss this milestone issue - crafted by the hackers for the hackers. Free, of course, as always. Grab your copy, meet the crew, and honor the zine that defined an era. The talk will explain a bit about Phrack's history, how it all started, and where it's going - the vision of the new editorial staff and how Phrack is changing. You will get a rare insight into what it takes to run an underground hacking magazine. You'll learn what it's like to work with the many authors, reading and fixing articles, dealing with obscure submissions, and what it takes to get your article accepted and become an author in Phrack. For the first time ever, a "secret challenge" has been included in the hardcopy magazine for you to find and to solve. The prize for the winner will be revealed at the talk. Piracy Is the Past, Present, and Future of Streaming Abigail De Kosnik, Benjamin De Kosnik Official ratings of TV viewership and box office revenues for films never tell the whole story of how people access popular media texts and instead promote platforms or corporations. Many millions around the world consume media through unofficial channels, especially peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks. In this session, you will be introduced to alpha60, an ongoing research project with six years of TV and film distribution data that reveals trends and oddities in global media desire. The speakers will present data on the quantity, timing, and location of downloads for major television series and films, offering data on unofficial global audienceship and speculating on new insights about cultural circulation, transnational belonging, and fandom. Planning a Project That Has No Budget Travis Southard Projects are notoriously hard for developers to manage even with project managers, budget limits, and deadlines. Often in hacking and civic tech, we are our own PMs, funders, and timekeepers, which means projects can simultaneously have no budget and unlimited budget. Since a community is not paying for a particular feature, they have no "I think we've reached where we want to stop spending" moment, so when is something done? It doesn't cost our coworkers to ask for more features, so when are they asking too much? Travis will talk about his experiences as a professional nonprofit legal aid developer and as a volunteer project lead to explore what's helped him when working with nebulous conditions around specific requirements. The Political and AI Singularity Are Inevitable - Or Are They? Roel Schouwenberg America's transition from a literary society to one shaped by social media and AI has revolutionized how we communicate, process information, and engage politically. AI's conversational nature deepens this shift, influencing culture and cognition. This talk will explore these new realities and provide insights into how to navigate them. The Present and Future of Online Discourse Harper Reed Today's technologies greatly empower individuals and groups, while simultaneously creating tremendous risks to freedom and privacy. How can major forces like big tech, artificial intelligence, and political governance be guided towards pro-social outcomes? What can individuals do? Is there hope for social media to heal divisions, rather than amplify discord? These and other topics will be addressed during this lively and far-ranging presentation. Print, Build, Fly, Heal: 3D-Printed Autonomous Planes for Medical Delivery in Rural Mexico Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller This talk focuses on a project with medical students in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico to develop affordable delivery drones that can get urgent medical supplies to remote communities. What currently takes days to reach by mule through mountainous terrain can hopefully be accomplished in minutes by air. This talk chronicles the evolution from off-the-shelf hobby planes to locally-built, 3D-printed aircraft capable of autonomous waypoint missions. The speakers will discuss the technical choices behind their current $1000 prototype (and how they plan to cut costs in half), alongside the organizational structure they're developing to sustain this work. Recently, they established "club guilas" with local medical students - one of whom has completed pilot training for the test aircraft. The biggest challenges faced aren't the technical ones, but rather organizational sustainability: how to transition from a project driven by visiting engineers to one owned and operated by local communities. Plans will be shared for creating a federated network of university clubs, and the blueprint for a lean nonprofit structure to support them. PrivacySafe and 3NWeb: Engineering User-Centric Digital Sovereignty Mikalai Birukou We want to control the technology we use, and we want to trust it. At the same time, we expect it to be convenient. 3NWeb is a groundbreaking framework that gives users full control over their digital interactions across devices, while preserving privacy and independence from centralized systems. Grounded in core principles like the principle of least authority (PoLA) and web-style federation, 3NWeb reimagines how services should operate in a user-first Internet. This presentation includes a demo of PrivacySafe, a client-side 3NWeb platform that is real, downloadable, and ready to use today. Its careful implementation raises meaningful questions from a range of perspectives: users, organizational administrators, application developers, and service providers. The session will address practical considerations and continue with in-depth conversations in the hallway track. PrivacyTests.org: Web Browser Leak Testing Arthur Edelstein PrivacyTests.org is an open source privacy audit of popular web browsers. The project subjects web browsers to automated leak tests and regularly publishes the browsers' test results head-to-head on a website and on social media. The goal of PrivacyTests is to encourage all web browsers to mend their ways and comprehensively protect everyone's privacy. By thoroughly exposing the leaks in web browsers, the website helps users choose a more private browser, and thereby puts pressure on browser makers to fix their privacy leaks. In his talk, Arthur will give some details about the project's approach to testing and presenting test results, and show how browser privacy has evolved over the past four years. Quantum Computing and AppSec: Preparing for the Post-Quantum Threat Sheshananda Reddy Kandula Quantum computing is poised to disrupt modern cybersecurity. With the potential to break widely used encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, quantum threats pose a significant risk to web applications, APIs, and secure communications. This talk provides an introduction to quantum computing for application security professionals, outlines the threats to current AppSec practices, and explores how organizations can begin transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Attendees will leave with an understanding of the timeline, tools, and strategies required to prepare for the post-quantum world. The Quantum Curtain Ed Ryan High technology has taken on a new meaning. As AI technologies grow increasingly creepy and quantum computing catches major headlines, the U.S. government is scrambling to cover its posterior. Recognizing that these technologies pose a significant security risk, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security has imposed export controls on AI and quantum computing technologies in an attempt to limit their spread. This talk will discuss the history of export restrictions, touching on cryptography and the Playstation 2, before moving on to explain the new restrictions and their implications for those working in impacted fields. The idea of a "deemed export," which limits who is even allowed to learn about certain technologies, will be addressed. QWK Packets and the Muffled Spark Jason Scott A deep dive into the QWK packet - a revolutionary addition to the Bulletin Board Experience of the 1980s - and the ramifications of what it represents in a very changed world. RDP Spray and Pray: Research on Modern RDP Attacks From Spray to Exploit Tess Mishoe RDP has been around the block for a while. Since 1998, admins shudder at the mere mention of port 3389. It's anything but old-hat, though - even today, there are a lot of active attack methods and adaptations for the modern world. This talk will be going through the world of RDP attacks from the perspective of an attacker, a defender, and us - the researchers and engineers. Some mass RDP attack data will be showcased, along with how to identify, label, and further prevent these attacks in the future. A Red Team Exercise 2025, 15 Years Later Tom Brennan, Vladislav Gostomelsky, Logan Klein This presentation is about red, blue and purple teams, along with the rest of the rainbow. Dig in for a fun and interactive presentation where the panel threat models and then attacks people, process, and technology. Bring your creative thinking and defensive skills and try to stop the... hackers. rim: Reclaiming Personal Data Sovereignty in the Age of Wearables Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller As we approach a future where body-worn devices capture increasingly intimate biometrics, the question of who controls that data has never been more urgent. This talk introduces rim, a techno-social vision and set of protocols challenging the standard model of cloud-based data extraction by building tangible, person-to-person systems for storing and sharing potentially intimate live data streams, innovating at the edge of taboo to expand human connection while preserving privacy and autonomy. There will be a demonstration of early prototypes of wearable devices implementing an "SD-core" aesthetic and detailing the technical underpinnings of protocol concepts including data "dissolution" and "crystallization" with erasure coding and intermittent connection tolerance. Beyond technical implementation, the presenters will discuss how this paradigm shift creates space for entirely new forms of human-to-human connection at the boundary of what's technically possible and socially acceptable. The Shape of the Legal Battlefield for InfoSec Professionals at Work Ken Vedaa It is no secret that sometimes there can be tension between InfoSec professionals and the organizations that they work for. Security professionals spend their days (and sometimes nights and weekends as well) buried in the dirty laundry that others pretend does not exist. These tensions can bubble up in unexpected ways. As an InfoSec professional, what are the common legal concerns that you need to be aware of at work? How do these challenges change over time? What should you keep in mind when considering a new job? A Sleuth's Stories on Detecting and Revealing Large-Scale Research Fraud Mu Yang In this talk, the speaker will share how they stumbled into this work by accident and what it's like to operate as a scientific sleuth within academia. The bulk of the presentation will focus on real-world cases of research fraud and misconduct, spanning fields from neurodegenerative diseases to chemistry, physics, and materials science. The talk will, through these examples, explore: the techniques and tools used to detect irregularities; how issues are reported to journals and publishers; the distinction between honest mistakes and deliberate manipulation; the collateral damage caused by misconduct, including its impact on public trust in science. The final section will examine the social and economic drivers of research fraud - and outline the systemic changes needed, globally, to break this cycle and restore integrity in science. Small Budget, Big Protection: Cyber Defense for SMBs Robert Wagner Small businesses often face significant challenges in defending their organizations with limited budgets. This talk will provide valuable insights into budget-friendly approaches to long-standing cybersecurity issues, helping small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) improve their security posture without excessive costs. Attendees will learn how to navigate the delicate balance between driving digital innovation and managing the risks of cyber threats and data breaches. Obstacles that prevent smaller companies from accessing affordable security resources will be explored along with practical solutions to overcome these hurdles. Many smaller organizations make the mistake of focusing solely on technology to solve their security problems, neglecting crucial aspects like people and processes. This talk will emphasize the importance of a holistic approach to cybersecurity, sharing strategies that larger companies have learned over decades. By understanding and implementing these strategies, SMBs can avoid common pitfalls and effectively raise their security standards. Attendees will leave with actionable tips on improving their cybersecurity practices within a limited budget, ultimately enhancing their overall defense capabilities. Solving My Identity Crisis Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker Traditionally, Internet accounts are controlled by the service providing them. There is no 'number portability' for email addresses. Switching costs discourage service changes. Recently, Bluesky has disrupted this model and 32 million users now use account names based on the Internet identity infrastructure, DNS - names that users can register and control directly through DNS handle providers. This presentation will describe three standards proposals extending this approach. @nywhere extends the authentication approach to allow DNS handle accounts to be used at any Internet resource, not just those running ATprotocol. @nyone combines the DNS handle approach with JSContact to provide account portability and secure exchange of credentials for end-to-end secure communication. @nything allows network connected devices to become true Internet things with an Internet DNS name, WebPKI credentials, and using @nywhere and @nyone to support access control. Spooky Action at a Discount: DIY Meshtastic Nodes Kody Kinzie To anyone interested in off-grid communication at a low cost, Meshtastic allows even beginners to communicate with (or control) devices from miles away. Thanks to applications in emergency communication, sensor monitoring, and censor-proof encrypted chat, Meshtastic is exploding in popularity even as the cost for making nodes is going down. This talk will cover the basics of Meshtastic, setting up and customizing nodes, plus outlining the tips and tricks to building affordable custom Meshtastic nodes, learned from building custom Nibble Meshtastic nodes for the conference. Attacks against Meshtastic and issues observed in the wild will also be covered. Expect to learn about LoRa, Meshtastic node and antenna options, how to deploy nodes for specific applications, attacks against Meshtastic, and how to join larger mesh networks in your local area! StickTock.com: An Open-Source Alternative in the Age of Digital Protectionism Sean O'Brien The threatened U.S. ban on TikTok represents a turning point in global digital policy, reflecting the rise of "data tariffs" - restrictions on the movement of information modeled after traditional trade barriers. While concerns over privacy and national security have fueled the decision, the move also aligns with economic protectionism that benefits domestic tech giants. The fallout from this policy shift could further fragment the global Internet, leading to retaliatory restrictions against American firms and diminishing access to diverse digital platforms worldwide. In response, privacy advocates and open-source developers have taken action. StickTock.com is a free and open-source frontend for TikTok, designed to allow users to access and share TikTok content without invasive tracking, advertisements, or the need for a proprietary app. Built by the team at PrivacySafe, StickTock.com is hosted in Iceland - a jurisdiction with strong commitments to Internet freedom and privacy. Their mission is to demonstrate that digital independence and free speech can thrive in the face of restrictive policies. This talk will delve into the development of StickTock.com as a case study in open-source innovation as a means of circumventing censorship and preserving privacy. The challenges of building privacy-first digital alternatives, the broader implications of government-imposed digital barriers, and the future of decentralized platforms will be explored. In an era where the free flow of information is increasingly under threat, open-source solutions offer a critical pathway toward digital resilience and user autonomy. The Struggle for Connection in a Fragmented World: Rebuilding Third Spaces Jack Gangi Third spaces - those vital, informal gathering places between home and work - have long been central to hacker culture, but they're vanishing. This talk will explore why third spaces matter more than ever for connection, creativity, and counterculture, and how we can rebuild them in a world increasingly fragmented by gentrification, digital monopolies, and social isolation. From hackerspaces to IRC to local meetups, Jack will trace our roots and offer ideas for rekindling authentic community, both online and off. Systems of Dehumanization: The Digital Frontlines of the War Against Bodily Autonomy Daly Barnett This presentation covers the years of security research and surveillance investigations that Daly (a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation) has done on the various threats facing movements for bodily autonomy. She covers the bad Internet bills that made sex work more dangerous, the ongoing struggle for abortion access in America, and the persecution of trans people across all spectrums of life. These issue-spaces are deeply connected, and the digital threats they face are uniquely dangerous. Come to learn about these threat models, as well as the cross-movement strategies being built for collective liberation against an authoritarian surveillance state. Things You Wish You Knew About Software Testing Dan Nagle Everybody agrees that software testing is important, but how does one actually go about accomplishing this efficiently? Here is a presentation about testing that has actual examples, immediate tools that can be used, and some really interesting and unexpected ways that code can break. This is a fast moving presentation discussing techniques in a way that both coders and non-coders can learn. Tips on Living Life in Interesting Times Mitch Altman What motivates us to do what we do? How do we find meaning in doing it? What makes us choose what we choose? Can we do better? What is important? Can we thrive and feel excellent, regardless of particular outcomes? These questions may now be more pressing than ever in our most interesting of times. Throughout our lives we tend to go with the flow of what is happening, making choices by default. Where do those choices come from? In the face of the rapidly changing and challenging times that we live in, personal and political, social and economic, can we find motivation to do what we do? Can we actually improve anything? Can we find and maintain enthusiasm to move forward into the unknown and feel good about our choices, regardless of outcome? Mitch will draw from lessons learned (and re-learned), doing his best to face the challenges while often haphazardly wandering through his 68 years on the planet. This talk will attempt to address these existential, important questions that we all face (whether consciously or not). Top Ten: Democratic Open Source Software Defined Radio and Amateur Radio Applications That Matter Today Steve Bossert A major benefit of the widely used open source Git platform is every project is voted on by its followers, making selection easy for what is the most popular and worth paying attention to. This presentation focuses on the top voted applications focused around software defined radio, as well as amateur "ham" radio. Time only permits the top ten to be covered. This is a great way to showcase how diverse these two crossover topic areas have become in recent years. Some projects are purely software-based while others are a mix of open source hardware plus software. High level coverage of these amazing projects will be included, but will be explored in more depth as part of a separate hands-on workshop during HOPE_16, making this presentation a must attend for anyone interested in radio-related topics! The Trials and Tribulations of Building Your Own Phone Wesley Appler (aka lamemakes) Over the last two decades digital surveillance has become baked into our daily lives. Your current and past location, who you're in contact with, habits/interests, sensor data, and a trove of other personal information is constantly being sent to third parties by the smartphone that is nearly always carried on us. What would it look like if we reconsidered the mobile phone entirely, putting extra emphasis on privacy and intentional disconnection via open source hardware and software? This talk will follow Wesley's journey to do just that, starting at the conception of the idea, getting acquainted with mobile networks/operators, obtaining proprietary datasheets, designing hardware, failed/successful prototypes, the current state of the project (along with demos), and how any interested parties can get involved. Turning Leaks Into Leads With OCCRP Aleph Ezana Ceman, Klil Eden You've got a leak, a name, or a suspicious company. What's your next move? In a world where corruption thrives in the shadows, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) provides the infrastructure to bring truth to light. At the core is Aleph, a powerful data platform built to help investigators follow the money and uncover complex networks across diverse sources. Bring your own data or explore the presenters' - the OCCRP data team collects and curates four billion records from nearly 200 countries, ranging from corporate registries and sanctions lists to court filings and leaked documents. This session will walk through how Aleph powers live investigations, transforming raw, chaotic data into structured insights that expose the actors and assets behind fraud and abuse of power. Designed by journalists, researchers, and developers on the frontlines, Aleph is more than a tool - it's a global community working together to uncover the truth. What will you find? Unearthing Air Todd Whitney Breathing polluted air is an unfortunately common human experience. Yet even as particulate matter settles in our lungs and occupies our minds more than ever, most of us lack the words and abilities to create better breathing environments. This talk will invite the HOPE community to develop personal and proactive approaches to the air we breathe by bringing it down to earth. Air is invisible, but very material and personal. This talk demonstrates hacking opportunities in the tools we traditionally use to sense, measure, and make air make sense. The presenter will dive into communication tools like the air quality index, open source sensors, and the emerging ethics of community air quality monitoring. Importantly, everyone will come away with fresh frameworks and tools they can use to begin designing their personal pollution priorities. When the Lawman Comes Calling - Government Data Demands and Online Platforms Fred Jennings Drawing on over a decade of experience, this talk will first introduce the statutes, rules, and concepts governing law enforcement requests for user data, ranging from basic subpoenas to secret FISA search warrants. From that foundation, the discussion will cover practical steps that web services and individual users can take to reduce their legal attack surface, minimize their risks, and maximize their protection from invasive data disclosures. Zodiac Killer Marketing: How I Used Codes, Cyphers and Nefarious Means to Launch a Covert Food Business Chef Adam Sobel During the pandemic, Adam launched Galactic MegaStallion, a new vegan food business, but decided traditional marketing was boring and morally icky. Instead, he created an elaborate system of codes, cyphers, a mysterious hotline, and strategically (and illegally) placed billboards that led curious people to find his food through coordinates. This presentation will cover how and why he developed this unconventional marketing approach, and how breaking traditional marketing rules and business conventions actually built a delighted customer base. HOPE_16 Closing Ceremonies Nothing lasts forever and that even applies to HOPE (the conference, not the concept). We will reminisce about what happened this weekend as if it was a decade ago. And we can guarantee there will be many fun stories to share. If you're really lucky, you'll get to help us clean up!

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back from a sell-off last week, climbing after a $9 billion earthquake. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price dropped to around $115,000 per bitcoin last week but has rebounded to touch $120,000, propelling the combined crypto market to back over $4 trillion and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as Elon Musk’s SpaceX sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, analysts are predicting the wild bitcoin price swings that have rocked the market in recent years could be over. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Traders are braced for a major change to the bitcoin price and crypto market. “The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over,” Mitchell Askew, a bitcoin analyst with the bitcoin miner Blockware, posted to X, echoing CryptoQuant chief executive Ki Young Ju who believes the bitcoin four-year cycle theory “is dead.” However, Askew also predicted that the bitcoin price will soar to $1 million over the next 10 years as it switches between “pump” and “consolidate" phases, adding: “It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. Strap in.” Historically, the bitcoin price has climbed to all-time highs in the years following a bitcoin halving that sees the number of new bitcoin issued to miners in exchange for maintaining the network cut by half. Bitcoin saw significant price surges in the second halves of 2017 and 2021, following halvings that occurred in 2016 and 2020. Bitcoin’s last halving, cutting the bitcoin block reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block, happened in April 2024. Others have also said they believe the so-called four-year bitcoin price cycle is over, pointing to the huge accumulation of bitcoin over the last few years by first Michael Saylor’s Strategy then by bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers led by BlackRock Strategy now controls 600,000 bitcoin worth $72 billion, sparking a flood of copy cat companies who are buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the combined bitcoin ETF issuers now hold 1.5 million bitcoin worth $175 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher this year, hitting an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin. "The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it," Kyle Chassé, a bitcoin and crypto commentator, posted to X alongside a video he appeared in with Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. "The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic "four-year cycle" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year," Hougan said in the clip. “I think it’s more ‘sustained steady boom’ than super-cycle,” Hougan added. “I could be wrong, and I’m certain there will be significant volatility." Other analysts have though pointed to the possibility of unexpected events as either boosting or crashing the bitcoin price—something they warn could happen at any time. “This fifth bitcoin bull market has been characterized by bursts of momentum and sudden pauses, rather than a steady, high sharpe ratio climb,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of bitcoin price and crypto analysis company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. “Each move has hinged on a clear catalyst: Fed rate expectations, Trump’s political traction, ETF breakthroughs, or regulatory interventions, such as the dismantling of crypto-friendly banks. That’s why staying laser-focused on macro triggers and reacting quickly to breakouts remains critical. In crypto, momentum is sparked by events, not driven by the calendar.”

Ex-BlackRock executive Chalom’s arrival signals SharpLink’s dedication to institutional-grade crypto exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. SharpLink Gaming is accelerating its Ethereum strategy with a major purchase that brings its total holdings closer to a key milestone of 500,000 ETH. On July 28, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain revealed that the firm acquired 77,210 ETH, worth approximately $295 million. This move brings SharpLink’s total Ethereum reserves to 438,017 ETH, valued at around $1.69 billion. While the company has not formally confirmed the latest buy, the transaction suggests SharpLink is pushing toward a 500,000 ETH target. Reaching that threshold would cement its position as the second-largest known corporate holder of Ethereum, behind only BitMine Immersion, which holds about 566,800 ETH valued at $2.21 billion. Meanwhile, data from Arkham Intelligence shows the newly acquired ETH was staked in 3,200 ETH batches using Figment. The firm is a leading provider of institutional staking infrastructure, offering services to over 500 institutional clients, including asset managers, exchanges, and large token holders. Early market indications show that SharpLink’s Ethereum-focused strategy appears to be resonating with investors. According to Google Finance data, the company’s stock (SBET) has surged over 120% in the past month. As of pre-market trading, the stock is priced at $23.61, up 7.37% on the day This Ethereum acquisition is the first major move since SharpLink named Joseph Chalom as Co-CEO on July 25. Chalom previously led digital asset strategy at BlackRock and played a key role in launching the BUIDL fund, as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. SharpLink’s chairman, Joseph Lubin, said Chalom’s appointment signals the firm’s deeper focus on institutional-grade crypto exposure. He furthered that Ethereum is entering a new phase, one that requires large capital, capable leadership, and long-term alignment. Lubin added: “Joseph brings all three. His decision to join Sharplink is a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum and for the role ETH will play in the future of capital markets. With stablecoins, ETH Treasury companies and top tier talent TradFi is onboarding to DeFI.” Chalom echoed this vision, saying: “Our goal [at SharpLink] is not just to hold ETH, but to activate it, using native staking, restaking, and Ethereum-based yield strategies. All to increase the value of our treasury and create long-term shareholder value.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change.

Ethereum’s 2025 bull rally is garnering serious attention — especially now that BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has crossed more than $10 billion. This has sparked new optimism about the ETH price, with whispers of a potential breakout to $10,000. With old-school giants joining in, projects such as Remittix (RTX) are trending toward more utility-driven strategies, addressing fundamental pain points in cross-border crypto payments. Ethereum is priced at $3,825.95, which is a 2.33% increase within the past 24 hours. The market capitalization of $461.68 billion positions it at the second-largest crypto rank, behind only Bitcoin. Volume traded is lower by 18.4%, though, and is at $24.35 billion, which could be reflective of a short-term breather after weeks of increasing optimism. Most long-term investors are hopeful the ETH price could retest highs. Legacy institutions launching spot ETFs have given renewed life to Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives, DeFi platforms, and crypto with real utility. As hype gathers steam, the search for the next giant altcoin 2025 gets more intense. That shine is increasingly turning towards smaller, high-utility tokens—like Remittix. The Remittix DeFi project is seriously gaining momentum in 2025 with a very specific mission: to enable users to send cryptocurrency directly to fiat bank accounts in 30+ countries. With this fiat bridge, there is no need to go through centralized exchanges, so real-world payments can be easily made by using RTX. The beta wallet, which will roll out in Q3 2025, will cover Ethereum and Solana, with low gas fees and fast transactions. It is best suited for freelancers, global workers, and those in emerging markets where bank services are not available. At $0.0876, Remittix has already raised $17 million+ and sold over 565 million tokens. Early buyers also get a 50% bonus, with the project heading towards its $18 million soft cap. You can buy RTX tokens here and view the wallet beta roadmap for upcoming milestones. The Remittix whitepaper also mentions long-term token deflation and cross-border expansion plans. Why Remittix Is Making Waves in 2025 With a $250,000 Remittix giveaway running and beta around the corner, RTX is in the spotlight as among the most undervalued crypto initiatives today. And while price movement in Ethereum may be the big news, Remittix is building the rails for real-world adoption behind the scenes.

Staffers at the notoriously secretive hedge fund D.E. Shaw fear the wildly lucrative left-wing firm could face “reprisals” from the Trump administration over its woke DEI policies, The Post has learned. The New York-based powerhouse founded by billionaire David E. Shaw — whose algorithm-driven trades made it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor magazine — has grown remarkably quiet of late when it comes to diversity, equality, and inclusion, sources said. D.E. Shaw did not respond to The Post’s emailed request for comment for this article. The company, which gave a young Jeff Bezos his big break in finance before he set up Amazon in 1994, has promoted DEI policies for years. A June 2019 memo obtained by The Post that was written by managing director Eddie Fishman encouraged staffers “to display their pronouns” that “align with their gender identity” in their emails so managers could “foster an inclusive culture.” But a review by The Post of archived pages from D.E. Shaw’s website shows that its DEI language has since been scrubbed, including references to how the firm “actively promotes LGBTQ+ inclusion.” Now, its site merely says it’s seeking “talented people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds.” One insider said top brass at the Wall Street firm — whose 74-year-old namesake helped bankroll the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — made “a strategic move” to steer away from full-throated wokeness over fear of catching the attention of the White House. “There was some concern that aggressive policies would make the firm a target for reprisals by the current administration,” the source said. “And we were about as aggressive as you could get.” “They were going 100 miles an hour on DEI in public, only then to drop to zero and fall off a cliff,’ said another staffer. “The communications have certainly been ratcheted back,” claimed a third employee. “It’s not as in-your-face as it once was.” D.E. Shaw’s retreat follows a Supreme Court ruling last month and a White House-led crackdown on corporate DEI policies, which critics say lower performance standards and foster so-called reverse discrimination. Top Department of Justice lawyer Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, issued the starkest of warnings to corporate America during a testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 23. “The goal is clear: either DEI will end on its own, or we will kill it,” the top Trump administration official said. Nevertheless, five sources with direct knowledge of the matter told The Post that executives at the company — founded by computer scientist Shaw in 1988 after he did stints at Stanford, Columbia and Morgan Stanley — are still paying lip service to wokeness to the rank and file. “They have said internally that our commitment and programs regarding DEI are not changing,” said another senior D.E. Shaw source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They have themselves in a bit of a bind. They went hardcore DEI to appear progressive and cater to liberal recruits,” a veteran of the firm added. “Internally, they are putting a brave face on it. But they are now very worried that the administration will start looking into them.” Fearing Trump’s ire, the hedge fund appears to have axed its “inclusive” Bridge internship. The program was set up in 2016 for “historically underrepresented” groups in finance. The ‘woke’ job placement schemes still featured prominently on D.E. Shaw’s website last week. But they have now been deleted after The Post approached the firm for comment on their DEI policies on Friday. According to an archived version of D.E. Shaw’s Campus website — an online recruitment portal — the firm created three programs aimed at diverse recruitment. Its “Discovery” program was “designed for students who self-identify as women”, while “Momentum” was aimed at those “who self-identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community D.E. Shaw also had a program called “Latitude,” which was “for students who self-identify as Native American or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.” Other Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Bank of America and Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase have scaled back their public commitments to DEI. The Post reported exclusively how Goldman decided to give woke the boot — on its website at least — when its partners met with CEO David Solomon in Miami in February. The Post attempted to speak to additional employees at D.E. Shaw, but they declined, citing fears of retribution from D.E. Shaw’s management, which has even been known to weigh in on whether employees can attend social gatherings with people who have left the company. “It is definitely something that people are talking about at the firm,” a separate person briefed on the matter told The Post. “The irony is that the whole firm is still very white and very male,” said another source. The hedge fund’s leadership team counts two females, Alexis Halaby and managing director Anne Dinning, amongst its ranks. The firm last made major headlines in 2022 when it was forced to pay a $52 million defamation settlement to one of its former rising stars, Dan Michalow, after an arbitration panel found that it had falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. Michalow, who always denied any wrongdoing, left the company not long after the start of the #MeToo movement, where hundreds of rich and powerful men were accused of sexual misdeeds. Aside from Amazon’s Bezos and his ex-wife, Mackenzie Scott, D.E. Shaw’s most famous alum is arguably Lawrence Summers. He served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and as director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council. Advertisement

Ethereum price prediction models are flashing green as August approaches, and institutional demand continues to climb. While ETH aims to break past the $4,500 resistance, investors are also flocking to newer projects like Remittix, which is becoming the go-to cross-border crypto solution in 2025. This August, Ethereum price prediction experts are eyeing strong resistance breakouts. Leading analysts like Fundstrat’s Mark Newton forecast Ethereum reaching $4,000–$4,500 in the short term, with longer-term predictions soaring to $15,000–$20,000 by year-end (Changelly forecast, Finance Magnates update). Driving this optimism is a surge in Ethereum ETF inflows led by BlackRock, coupled with reduced liquid supply as more ETH is staked across DeFi protocols. This bullish cycle aligns with major trends like the rise of Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives and top crypto to buy lists focused on blue-chip altcoins. With decentralized exchange volume climbing and smart contract usage on the rise, ETH is once again leading the charge among long-term crypto investments. Remittix is making waves in the early stage crypto investment scene. Whale activity has surged since the announcement of its Q3 wallet beta, which enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. At a price of $0.0876, over 551 million tokens have already been sold, raising $17.4M+ to date. This cross-chain DeFi project is solving real problems in borderless finance—and investors are paying attention. A Nigerian freelancer recently used Remittix to accept ETH and convert it to mobile funds to support his family instantly. That’s the kind of utility missing from most low cap crypto gems. Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, as smart investors seek crypto with passive income potential and real-world impact. While Remittix delivers utility, Pepe continues to attract meme coin momentum. Whale wallets have scooped up trillions of tokens recently, including a massive $22M withdrawal from Binance. These high-volume moves signal bullish sentiment. Source: TradingView PEPE is forming a bullish cup-and-handle chart structure, with traders predicting gains of 40% or more. It’s a speculative bet, but one that still commands strong attention in the meme coin space. Ethereum price prediction targets remain high for August, but whales aren’t just holding ETH. They’re hedging into upcoming crypto projects like Remittix and low gas fee crypto plays like PEPE for broader exposure this bull cycle. If you’re looking for the next 100x crypto, this could be your signal.

Title: DWF Ventures Analyzes Catalysts Behind ETH’s Price Rally, Including Rising Institutional Interest

July 28, 2025 – Dubai, United Arab Emirates It examines the catalysts behind ETH’s rally, which has seen its price rise by 70% in the past month, with a particular focus on institutional support. In its analysis, first published as an X thread, DWF Ventures assesses whether ETH’s recent performance is indicative of an Ethereum season arriving, propelling both ETH and the assets its EVM ecosystem supports to greater heights. DWF pinpoints the triggers that have prompted ETH to break out of a three-year downtrend and flip bullish. The Web 3.0 investment firm notes that ETH’s recent price rise hasn’t occurred in a vacuum but is rather the product of growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. On-chain activity on Ethereum has been increasing steadily including transactions, active addresses, volume and the total percentage of ETH staked. Many of these metrics are at or approaching ATHs (all-time highs), paving the way for ETH to move up. As highlighted in the report, institutions are increasingly acquiring ETH as a strategic asset, whose ETF inflows have surged past 230,000 ETH in a single day, while the ETH/BTC ratio has broken out of a multi-year downtrend. The analysis observes that companies are leveraging ETH for treasury diversification, capitalizing on its yield-generating potential through staking and DeFi integrations. It also asserts that greater regulatory clarity, aided by legislation such as the GENIUS Act, has provided the transparency required to attract cautious investors, paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Public companies that have purchased significant quantities of ETH include SharpLink Gaming, which DWF Ventures records as having purchased over $1 billion of the crypto asset since May 2025. It acknowledges that BTC remains the asset of choice for public companies acquiring crypto but suggests that ETH’s ability to generate native yield via staking is desirable for preferred stock holders who are accustomed to receiving dividends. Other tailwinds contributing to ETH’s rally, as outlined by DWF Ventures, include the CLARITY Act, which places less restrictions on institutions accessing ETH because it is regarded as a commodity rather than a security. It also notes that while the GENIUS Act was primarily concerned with stablecoins, Ethereum’s dominance of almost 50% of the total stablecoin market cap will work in its favor as stablecoin capitalization increases. DWF Ventures concludes by analyzing increased institutional demand to bring capital on-chain through tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) and participation in DeFi, with Ethereum overwhelmingly the blockchain of choice. It cites global institutions including BlackRock, PayPal, Deutsche Bank and UBS – all utilizing Ethereum infrastructure. The analysis finishes by saying, “The strong performance of associated sectors and tokens are encouraging signs of a potential ‘ETH szn,’ especially for protocols that share and benefit from overlapping tailwinds in clearer regulation, stablecoin expansion and onboarding of institutional capital.” The full ETH analysis from DWF Ventures can be read here.

East Asia A view of the Balboa Port is pictured in Panama City, Panama on Mar 4, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Enea Lebrun) HONG KONG: Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said Monday (Jul 28) it was considering inviting a Chinese "major strategic investor" to join a United States-led consortium negotiating the sale of its global ports business outside China, including operations at the Panama Canal. The firm said in March it was offloading the ports - including operations in the vital Central American waterway - to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. The consortium was to include BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading The sale was seen as a political victory for US President Donald Trump, who had vowed to "take back" the Panama Canal from alleged Chinese control, prompting Beijing's ire. China's market regulator said in March it was reviewing the deal. In May, Hutchison co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte. Aponte's family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with the owner of CK Hutchison Li Ka-shing, who is also Hong Kong's richest man. "(CK Hutchison) remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting (a) major strategic investor from (China) to join as a significant member of the consortium," CK Hutchison said in a stock exchange filing Monday. The firm added that changes to the consortium's membership and deal structure will be needed for the deal "to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities". It said the "period for exclusive negotiations" mentioned in the March announcement had expired, but discussions will continue. It did not name the major investor.

The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27. China's biggest shipping company Cosco was set to join the consortium and was requesting veto rights or equivalent powers, Bloomberg News reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong told the outlet that "ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal's viability". Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said Monday's developments show that "business deals can be increasingly subject to politics in the new economic and geopolitical reality" as the Hong Kong conglomerate seeks to "keep everyone happy". CK Hutchison said it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions to achieve" a workable arrangement. It said it had stated on several occasions that it "will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities". The initial deal, valued at nearly US$23 billion including US$5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. That agreement also required approval from Panama’s government. Its Hong Kong-listed shares fell 0.6 per cent Monday, while Cosco dropped 2.2 per cent. AFP has contacted Cosco for comment.

Title: Somnath Mukherjee: Sebi’s Jane Street order was the canary our market needed

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arbitrage or market manipulation? Jane Street believes it is an uber-efficient arbitrageur. It spotted pricing anomalies between index options and the index’s stock constituents, and used sophisticated trading models to profit from the arbitrage. The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) order has some interesting findings. On 17 January 2024, the expiry day for Bank Nifty derivatives, the index opened 2% lower due to weak earnings of some of its constituents. However, options on the Bank Nifty traded at a level where the implied price was higher, resulting in an anomalous price spread. JS did what textbooks tell us: buy stocks that make up the Bank Nifty while selling options on this index. The trade worked as textbooks say it would: the spread narrowed within six minutes. But here’s the twist: the total value of Bank Nifty stocks purchased was ₹572 crore while the total notional value of the options sold was ₹8,751 crore, which is more than 15 times. This oddity continued. By mid-day, JS had bought Bank Nifty stocks and futures worth over ₹5,000 crore and sold options worth over ₹30,000 crore. Arbitrage is about hedging, but one doesn’t hedge a bet on India winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by placing 15 bets on India not-winning it. So JS started selling its stock/futures positions. But liquidity in these segments is so low that its trades tanked prices, resulting in losses for JS in its long index positions. But its large short options position (5-6 times in notional exposure to its cash/futures positions) got settled at market close at a massive profit. In short, JS appeared to move prices in the illiquid leg of the market (cash/futures) so that it could profit from its large position in the liquid leg (options). Also Read: Devina Mehra: How derivative dreams can turn into nightmares but still lure investors Arbitrage or manipulation? Either way, Sebi’s order has acted as the proverbial canary in the coal mine to reveal potentially poisonous fumes in our capital markets. Fume 1—Lopsided market structure: India’s equity market is the second largest among emerging economies by market capitalization and volumes both. However, volumes are skewed—over 90% are in derivatives (futures and options or F&O), with options accounting for the bulk. The cash segment is shallow. Daily volumes in the shares of HDFC Bank, the largest Bank Nifty constituent, for instance, are only about ₹2,000 crore. To put this in context, the total equity assets under management of India’s mutual funds (MFs) are over ₹30 trillion, with ₹50-60,000 crore worth of flows every month. This skew causes distortions. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Jane Street’s secret sauce for Indian markets should be tested out Fume 2—Skewed tax structure: A small ₹5,000 crore trade could move prices because there is no countervailing Indian entity that’s able to provide liquidity by playing the other side of JS’s ‘arbitrage’ trades. The reason is simple—tax rules. In India, the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives is a fraction of what it is on stocks, incentivizing investors to move to F&O from the cash segment. Further, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) enjoy a large tax advantage over Indians. FPIs’ F&O trades qualify for capital-gains tax (and are taxed at 20% if short-term and 12.5% if long-term), but for Indian entities, the same gains are deemed to be income (taxed at 25% for corporates and 39% for individuals/trusts). Fume 3—Regulation stifles Indian institutions: For many years, FPIs provided the dominant share of liquidity in Indian stock markets. Over the last decade, Indian institutions, especially MFs, have risen in stature and now account for a larger share of India’s market capitalization and volumes than FPIs. This provides a diversified pool of liquidity in the cash segment. But in the F&O segment, a regulatory overhang prevents the creation of such counterweight liquidity. Why? Also Read: Jane Street: Gaming an outdated system is not necessarily illegal in India First, domestic institutional investors are mostly not allowed to use leverage, but FPIs are. Second, short-selling, which lets market participants act on bearish views, exists mostly in the realm of theory; its process is such that participation and liquidity are low. Third, a prudential aversion to leverage has left F&O trading as its only source. Bank lending to capital markets is heavily circumscribed and non-banking financial companies have limited capacity to lend. This reduces domestic market liquidity and pushes participants towards the F&O segment. Fourth, while there are all sorts of limits in equity markets, index options face none. This means participants can build positions in index options many times the stock position limits on the underlying stocks. Fifth, a very high proportion of market liquidity is concentrated in short-term options contracts. India is unique as a large market with zero liquidity in derivatives of more than three months tenor. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street interim order made India’s stock market sit up for good reason Solutions are within grasp: India’s financial markets are world class. So are its regulators (think of Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India). Diversified liquidity is the lifeblood of any well-functioning market. Small tweaks in tax laws, alongside a rethink on the flexibility afforded to Indian institutions (especially MFs) would be a great fresh start. The appointment of market-makers for longer-dated derivatives is another idea that is well-tested in India; in the 1990s, RBI licensed a slew of primary dealers as market-makers for government bonds with great results. India’s capital markets are valuable. Sebi has done its bit as the canary by highlighting emergent risks. It is time now to make space for fresh ideas so that the mine continues to prosper for India.

Title: Earn $8900 a day with your mobile phone with BTC Miner!

As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) steadily runs in the range of $118,000 to $120,000, the market’s expectations for it to hit historical highs again are getting stronger. With the continuous increase in institutional holdings and the continuous inflow of funds on the chain, the crypto market is entering a structural growth cycle with policy loosening, capital acceleration, and technology upgrading as the core. But for ordinary investors, facing the reality of high currency prices and volatility, how to enter the market and how to make stable profits? Smart cloud mining platform BTC Miner may be the answer. According to Coindesk data, Bitcoin has tested the area above $119,000 many times in the past 72 hours, and the technical side shows strong support signs. If it can successfully break through the current platform consolidation area, the next target may be $130,000. At the same time, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s “realized cap” has exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, which means that more long-term investors will include BTC in their core asset allocation rather than a short-term speculative tool. This bull market is no longer driven by emotions, but a systematic revaluation driven by ETF funds, policy shifts and institutional buying. BTC Miner: Ordinary people can also seize institutional dividends While the crypto market is developing rapidly, BTC Miner is using a simple, efficient, and automated way to provide ordinary investors around the world with a low threshold to enter the mining income. Five core advantages of the platform: 1. Zero technical threshold, one-click mining Users do not need equipment or blockchain knowledge; they only need to register and purchase contracts, and the system automatically allocates computing power and participates in the mining of mainstream currencies such as BTC, XRP, ETH, and DOGE. 2. Daily automatic settlement, transparent income to the account The platform implements an automatic income calculation and distribution mechanism, and you can see the income account every day, which is clear and traceable, avoiding the uncertainty of waiting and fluctuations. 3. Register to get $500 computing power, free trial mining for new users BTC Miner gives $500 computing power to all new users, and you can experience the real mining process without recharging, and the daily stable income is credited to your account in real time. 4. Multi-currency support, global use Supports recharge and withdrawal of mainstream crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, DOGE, etc., and the internal income is calculated in US dollars, which is unified and transparent. Referral rewards, build a passive income network Through the invitation mechanism, users can get up to 7% rebate to create a sustainable passive income model. Bitcoin has entered an upward track, but the investment threshold is also rising simultaneously. Compared with the high volatility and high threshold of direct currency holding, BTC Miner provides a lightweight and stable income alternative: purchase computing power contracts from a minimum of $200, with an annualized income of up to 180%+. BTC Miner continues to optimize product structure and profit mechanism, and launches diversified contract solutions suitable for all types of investors. All plans support automatic settlement of daily income, and return principal when the contract expires, which is simple and transparent: Contract principal Contract period Daily income Total income at expiration (Actual income is intelligently adjusted according to market conditions and contract types, transparent and traceable) Especially in the stage where the currency price has not yet broken through significantly and the mining difficulty is still controllable, early entrants can obtain more attractive returns. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of BlackRock, recently said that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates as soon as possible to release liquidity; Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Fund, suggested that investors allocate at least 15% of their assets to Bitcoin and gold. All signs indicate that Bitcoin is gradually becoming a new generation of “risk hedging and value-added” dual tools. For most ordinary investors who cannot deploy capital and resources like institutions, the cloud mining platform BTC Miner provides an opportunity to stand at the same starting line as institutions. You can also make money through invitations: just share your personal invitation link. Directly invite friend B: 7% rebate [Friend B invests $10,000, you can get $700] Friend B invites C: 2% rebate [C invests $10,000, you can get $200] Build an exclusive computing power network, earn while using, and share the benefits! The price of Bitcoin is on the eve of a key breakthrough, and the BTC Miner cloud mining platform has opened a stable door to high returns for ordinary people. It is not only a new way to participate, but also a passive income tool that resists inflation and stabilizes growth. If you want to seize this round of structural bull market, act now.

Title: Hong Kong's CK Hutchison seeks Chinese investor to join Panama Ports deal
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hong-kongs-ck-hutchison-seeks-chinese-investor-join-124126111
Time Published: 2025-07-28T06:28:04Z
Full Content:
A Hong Kong conglomerate that’s selling ports at the Panama Canal says it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong conglomerate that had agreed to sell its two ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan to sell port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc. pleased U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the critical shipping lane’s operations in Panama. However, the deal apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty brought by tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hutchison said in a statement Monday that the exclusive negotiations period with the consortium had expired. However, it added “the Group remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. It said it needed to change the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction for the deal to be able to pass reviews by “all relevant authorities.” In Beijing, a Chinese official said the government had noted the announcement but did not comment directly on it. “The Chinese government will conduct supervision in accordance with the law, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain market fairness and justice,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a daily briefing. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. The awkward position Hutchison found itself in for months highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. It announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. A Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong posted scathing commentaries about the deal, with one describing it as a betrayal of all Chinese. Chinese government offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs reposted some of the commentaries, widely seen as an indication of the Chinese leaders’ stance. In May, Hutchinson co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. That agreement would have also required approval from Panama’s government. The deadline for the exclusive negotiation period ended on Sunday. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery CK Hutchison said it may invite a "major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock. "Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

Title: Investors Bet Li Ka-Shing Will Clinch Controversial Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Shirley Zhao Jul 27, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Investors are regaining enthusiasm for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. despite a delay in the company’s plan to sell 43 ports, with optimism fueled by news that a Chinese shipping behemoth is finding its way into the global deal. Shares of CK Hutchison, which oscillated between gains and losses since the company first announced the deal on March 4, reached the highest this year on Friday after state-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. emerged as a potential new member of the buyer consortium that includes American asset manager BlackRock Inc. Although a 145-day exclusivity window for talks between CK Hutchison and the buyers’ group lapsed on Sunday, the possible involvement of China Cosco is boosting expectations that it would nudge the transaction forward. Beijing has so far viewed the deal as a threat to its interests because it would transfer two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, which China sees as a proxy for American influence. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. China separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. As of last week, the buyers’ group was considering China Cosco’s demand for veto rights to secure Beijing’s interests, Bloomberg News reported. CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement in March, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. The share price recovery shows investors are increasingly betting on Li Ka-shing, the 96-year-old founder of CK Hutchison, to seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. With President Donald Trump billing the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence, that didn’t help. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: GE’s 400% Breakup Return Is A Wake-Up Call For Every CEO

ByJim Osman ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 06: CEO of GE and CEO of GE Aerospace, Larry Culp, speaks onstage ... More during GE The Lean Mindset: The Pursuit Of Progress Event at Chelsea Industrial on September 06, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for GE) There was a time when GE symbolized everything wrong with corporate bloat. I wrote about it in 2019, covering the damage done by Welch’s financial engineering, Immelt’s empire-building, and the pension time bomb that dragged the company into long-term decline. It became a cautionary tale for investors who confused brand power with balance sheet strength. The GE breakup is now a success story that everyone, particularly CEOs, should be aware of. What followed would have been unthinkable at the time. GE has now delivered a 400 percent return to shareholders through one of the most effective corporate breakups in recent history. This was not a lucky outcome. It was a structural reset. Larry Culp did not save GE by patching it up. He saved it by dismantling what no longer worked and letting the market revalue the parts. The result is not just a comeback story. It is a signal to every CEO sitting on underperforming assets that the path to value is already in plain sight. Culp did what many before him were unwilling to do. He separated GE into three focused businesses: aviation, healthcare, and energy. It was a structural necessity. Each business had a distinct capital profile, a different growth outlook, and a unique investor base. For years they had been buried inside a complex, legacy-driven machine that masked their true value. The aerospace unit became GE Aerospace, a pure-play with visibility, margins, and scale. GE Healthcare stepped into a sector where clarity and comparables drive multiples. GE Vernova, the energy unit, aligned with the market's demand for clean transition and infrastructure exposure. These were not spinoffs in name alone. Each company now controls its own cost base, strategy, and capital allocation decisions. That separation of function is exactly what the market needed. It created three investable stories, not one misunderstood puzzle. This is why The Edge focuses on these types of situations, not just valuation screens. A business is only as valuable as its structure allows it to be. When that structure is misaligned, price alone tells you nothing. GE’s transformation is proof that when incentives and operations are realigned, the value follows quickly. GE Vs S&P Post Spinoff Once the separation plan was set in motion, the market responded with precision. Investors didn’t need another narrative. They needed clarity. With each division operating independently, the ability to assign real multiples returned. GE Aerospace quickly established itself as a dominant player in a post-COVID aviation cycle. GE Vernova captured attention as a levered play on energy transition and grid modernization. GE Healthcare stepped into its own, attracting sector-focused capital that once ignored the parent entirely. What resulted was a strong re-rating. The market priced the businesses as they were, not as they had been hidden inside a tangled conglomerate. I called this early in my 2024 Forbes piece on GE’s revival, when the breakup began to gain traction with institutions. Barron’s followed with a lead feature quoting my assessment of Culp’s plan. The message was the same: the market doesn’t reward some fantastic ideas (this can be the major problem with turnarounds); it rewards a laid-out, quantifiable structure. Once that changed, so did the stock. The 400 percent return was the consequence, not the goal. What set the GE breakup in motion wasn’t a new product or a market shift. It was leadership. Larry Culp saw what his predecessors refused to acknowledge. GE didn’t need to be fixed. It needed to be stripped back. For decades, successive CEOs measured success by size—more divisions, more deals, more complexity. Culp reversed that thinking and proved that focus, not scale, is what drives shareholder return. Under Welch and Immelt, GE had become a monument to corporate ego. Diversification was seen as strength, even as the market lost the ability to value the parts. Culp understood that investors don’t want a riddle. They want clean stories, clear numbers, and defined upside. This same leadership vacuum now exists at Boeing. I laid that out earlier this year in a piece calling for a rockstar CEO to take the reins. The lesson applies across sectors. If leadership isn’t aligned with structure, value will stay hidden. The GE breakup worked because someone was finally willing to make hard decisions. GEV Vs S&P Post Spinoff Despite the success of the GE breakup, most CEOs still avoid this path. Not because it lacks merit, but because it requires a level of self-awareness that many don’t possess. Breaking up a business means admitting that the structure you built no longer serves shareholders. That’s a hard pill to swallow for executives whose careers were spent expanding, acquiring, and defending size as a strategy. The diversification myth still holds power. It gives the illusion of stability while masking underperformance. The market doesn’t want blended results. It wants exposure to what works, without the drag of what doesn’t. The real reason more companies don’t follow GE’s lead is simple. Change threatens control. A breakup reduces influence, reshapes org charts, and opens management to scrutiny. So instead of running toward structural change, most CEOs run from it. That choice may protect their tenure, but it leaves shareholder value locked in the shadows. The GE breakup reminds us where real alpha lives. It is not found in low multiples or discounted cash flows alone. It is found in structure, timing, and the presence of a catalyst. A cheap stock without change is just a value trap and I always speak about cheap stocks becoming cheaper. A misunderstood business in the middle of a structural shift? That’s an opportunity. This is what I wrote about in Price Catalysts: “Value without a trigger is just dead money.” The market doesn’t reward potential. It rewards movement. That’s why the GE story mattered. The setup was there for years—misunderstood assets, bloated overhead, misaligned capital. But only when the structure changed did the return appear. At The Edge, this is where we focus. We don’t chase momentum or screen for what’s cheap. We look for businesses on the verge of transformation. Spin-offs. Restructurings. Activist pressure. Forced selling. These are not stories. They’re setups. GE wasn’t a surprise to those watching the structural pressure build. It was a long-awaited release of value the market had simply stopped believing in until it couldn’t ignore it anymore. GEHC Vs S&P Post Spinoff The GE breakup is no longer a case study. It’s a playbook. Every CEO and board now has a real-world example of what happens when structural change meets disciplined leadership. Mediocre boards can’t pretend anymore. You don’t need a new product, a market shift, or the perfect macro backdrop. You need a willingness to rethink what you’ve built and the courage to unlock what’s already there. The same logic applies to other conglomerates hiding value. Boeing still carries too much weight from its disjointed divisions. Johnson & Johnson took a step in the right direction but stopped short of full separation. Consumer giants with sleepy product lines and overgrown portfolios are no different. You don’t need new tech. You need new thinking. The GE breakup didn’t invent value. It revealed it. And it showed that the fastest way to deliver shareholder returns is often the hardest, changing the very structure that once defined you. GE waited until it had no choice. Most companies do. But the GE breakup shows what happens when the right leadership acts before the market demands it. The value was always there. Value release sometimes needs a catalyst. If you’re running a company sitting on undervalued assets, you have a decision to make. Wait until you’re forced into action or lead the revaluation yourself. Because if you don’t unlock the value, someone else will. And when they do, it won’t be on your terms. The playbook is open. Time is not on your side.

Title: Wells Fargo Warns Fed Rate Cut and Additional Catalysts Could Trigger Pullback for Group of Assets – Here’s the Bank’s Outlook

Banking titan Wells Fargo is unveiling a scenario that could trigger a correction for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused stocks. In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. “A lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They’re talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don’t know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It’s really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we’re getting.” Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. “One thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that’s the biggest fear for AI right now.” Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

Tech heavyweights Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon.com are set to report earnings this week. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images) This week is the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 161 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Merck (MRK), Starbucks (SBUX), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). Four of the Magnificent 7 are also on the docket this week. According to FactSet, 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 34% of companies having already reported results. S&P 500 Earnings Season Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 6.4% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.6%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.9%. Earnings Estimate Summary The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high last week. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed primarily due to Tesla’s performance. Market Performance Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla entered the earnings season with low expectations, but it failed to impress with its report last week. Tesla was the worst-performing member of the Magnificent 7, falling 4.1% last week. Alphabet, parent of Google, was expected to report robust earnings growth and managed to exceed expectations, sending the stock 4.4% higher for the week. Alphabet’s cloud revenue soared by 31.7% year-over-year, with improving operating margins. Data suggests that their artificial intelligence (AI) search is growing, without the feared decline in monetization. Google increased its planned 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion, reflecting its confidence in the AI outlook, but investors are (rightly) always cautious about massive capital investments. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close on Wednesday, then Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth Positive earnings surprises from the financial and communication services sector were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Capital One Financial (COF) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be limited upside to sales growth from here. Better sales results in the communication services and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with crucial releases this week after a lull last week. The first look at second-quarter US economic growth comes on Wednesday. GDP growth is expected to rebound to 2.4% after a decline in the first quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, the headline GDP number is likely to overstate the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. US GDP Growth The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with essentially no chance of any change to rates. Instead, market participants will be looking for clues as to when the next Fed rate cut will occur. Markets are currently pricing in a 66% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. Fed Rate Cuts Expected News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. Sectoral tariffs could also be announced. As a positive note, a trade deal framework with Japan was announced last week, providing reason for optimism about additional agreements with other nations. Also on Friday, the monthly jobs report is expected to continue showing modest but slowing growth in nonfarm payrolls. The unemployment rate is expected to reverse last month’s decline and increase to a still low 4.2%. Stocks & Recession Odds Stocks continue to be boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. The betting odds of a 2025 recession fell to the lowest level of the year, while stocks reached an all-time high.

Here's where you can put that cash right now, according to six Wall Street veterans. On the agenda today: But first: How do they do it? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Ever wonder how the world's most accomplished business leaders make it all look so effortless? How do they conquer jam-packed calendars, build empires, and still find time to fly helicopters or sip matcha in peace? Welcome to Power Hours, a fresh Business Insider series that peels back the curtain on the daily routines of top CEOs, founders, and creative visionaries. We're going deep on what makes these high performers tick — and how you can apply their secrets to your own life. We've gone behind the scenes with leaders like Peter Beck, CEO of Rocket Lab, who starts his day before sunrise, ruthlessly cuts out unnecessary meetings, and flies a helicopter in his spare time. David Risher, CEO of Lyft, winds down with afternoon matcha and occasionally goes undercover as a driver to stay connected to his mission. Here's a snapshot of some of the leaders we've profiled. Each Power Hours profile delivers a dose of inspiration — and a toolkit of takeaways — for readers to better understand how the pros do it all. So, what are your Power Hours? Let us know, we'd love to hear from you! For years, the Spaghett — a mix of cheap beer and Aperol — was known almost exclusively by service industry workers. Now, it's making its way into the spotlight. The Spaghett's rise is also a sign that the economy is on the edge of disaster. It's a lot cheaper than other cocktails and easy to make at home — a standout choice for when you feel pressure on your wallet. No frills, great flavor. The silver lining of mass layoffs is that no one has to go through it alone. From former Big Tech workers to laid-off federal employees, old coworkers are banding together on networks like Slack and Signal. In their private channels, laid-off workers offer each other more than just emotional support. They're helping each other navigate the confusing administrative tasks that come with being fired, sharing job postings, and engaging in mock interviews. Experts say it reflects a surge in worker resistance. Secretive investors are betting big on the next homebuilding boom. Known as "land bankers," these investors are scooping up construction-ready real estate and waiting until builders are ready to put shovels in the ground. The result would be a more reliable homebuilding machine and even cheaper homes. That's great news for homebuyers in the near future. A new breed of land barons. Big Tech companies and startups are racing to dominate the next frontier of AI, and they're shelling out top dollar to the limited pool of tech talent who will join them.

Title: Inside the Private Equity Scam—and the Livelihoods It Has Destroyed

Time Published: 2025-07-27T10:00:00Z

In 2019, when I was working what I have grudgingly come to accept may be one of the best jobs I’ll ever have, my employer, Gizmodo Media Group, was acquired by a private equity firm called Great Hill Partners. Private equity had not shown itself to be a great friend of journalism: Alden Global Capital, another firm, had just gutted the Pulitzer Prize–winning Denver Post. Still, my colleagues and I on the company’s investigative team were cautiously optimistic about the new management, personified by our new CEO, an executive named Jim Spanfeller, who had previously run Forbes’s digital arm. Following a rough few years, an infusion of cash seemed like it could be a good thing. Our soft skepticism, it turns out, was disastrously naïve. Within days of the sale, both of my editors had been fired by people who did not appear to know they had direct reports, leaving my team to collect paychecks without any actual work to do—a particularly comical hit, given the firm’s alleged goal to eradicate waste. Out of a sense of duty, most of us assigned ourselves to other sites within the company. But the new management insisted we replace much of our reporting with slideshows to artificially inflate our audience. Invasive, auto-playing ads became such a problem that we fielded constant complaints from our readers. Our product and sales teams disappeared. People routinely left meetings frazzled and burdened by bizarre mandates with little data to back them up. I stuck it out for a while; I truly adored my job reporting alongside people who alternately delighted and intimidated me, journalists I had admired for years. I finally made the decision to quit when management rewrote a sensitive story, entirely fabricating key details, and tried to pass the work off as my own. It wasn’t just that the company was being run poorly, or that Great Hill was trying to squeeze every last penny out of our labor. It was that the people in charge seemed actively hostile to our attempts to do good, ethical, even profitable work. No one is going to visit a website they can’t trust or even use. I’m not a businessman, but a libel lawsuit seems bad for the bottom line. And there was something almost hallucinatory about working under people with such a vague grasp of our corner of the industry, who were so deeply incurious about the work that went into the brands they were allegedly trying to save. Meanwhile, across the office, the journalist Megan Greenwell was struggling with a much higher-profile version of this conundrum. As was extensively reported in the New York media press, Greenwell, then the editor in chief of the anarchic and beloved sports site Deadspin, publicly resigned four months after Great Hill purchased our company. “The tragedy of digital media isn’t that it’s run by ruthless, profiteering guys in ill-fitting suits,” she wrote in an eviscerating blog post announcing her departure. “It’s that the people posing as experts know less about how to make money than their employees, to whom they won’t listen.” Greenwell’s entire staff followed her lead shortly after, mass quitting largely in protest of a mandate to abandon higher-traffic stories about politics and internet oddities (and irreverent classics like “my enemies in nature, ranked”) to focus entirely on sports. In the years since, the Deadspin story has become something of a parable about media and private equity and the ultimate value of those guys in the ill-fitting suits. Following the resignation, a number of former Deadspin writers launched Defector, a worker-owned publication that claimed 40,000 paid subscribers as of last year. And, as Greenwell writes in Bad Company, her wide-ranging account of private equity’s impact on American life, over a period of less than five years, Great Hill executives ran Deadspin so far into the ground that it “draws slightly less traffic than a Pennsylvania dog breeder called greenfieldpuppies.com.” Last spring, the remaining writers were laid off and the brand sold to a Maltese company with plans to feature “gambling content” on the site. Almost all of the 12 websites that Great Hill originally purchased have been auctioned off in severely depleted states. This July, Spanfeller announced that G/O Media (as the collection of sites was rebranded) was “working towards a full wind down,” noting “we will exit having increased shareholder value.” Years later, I still acutely remember the shock of watching a few guys armed with little more than inspirational quotes turn a functional if imperfect company into a series of spammy content farms. “Making it difficult to know what’s going on is exactly the point of so much about how private equity operates,” argues Greenwell in Bad Company. She follows four people in disparate industries—retail, health care, journalism, and housing—trying, as we did at Gizmodo Media, to understand why people claiming to revitalize our companies did exactly the opposite. For people who genuinely desire functional, vibrant institutions, funds like Great Hill can represent not just a logistical but an emotional challenge. It’s not easy to watch something you depend on, and spent countless hours analyzing and agonizing over, systematically stripped for parts. Greenwell’s book seeks to answer the questions many people at the receiving end of a private equity takeover want to know: Who are these people, how did they get here, and what on Earth do they actually want? Ostensibly, private equity firms flip underperforming private companies kind of like houses: The firms raise capital to buy “distressed assets” wholesale, take out (often massive) loans to cover a rehabilitation job, and pay their investors when the business either goes public or is sold. Greenwell locates the origin of these leveraged buyout arrangements in the “bootstrap deals” of the 1960s, when financial firms took on companies that were successful but too small to go public. Within a decade, opportunistic executives started targeting larger companies. By the ’80s, hostile takeovers of Fortune 500 companies became common, if not exactly the norm. Today’s private equity landscape is vast: Once you’re attuned to the industry’s hold on nearly every aspect of American life, it feels impossible to escape. My local grocery, an iconic New York institution once owned by a family that pledged to hire union-represented locals and maintain the lowest prices in the city, was sold in 2020 to a national chain after a takeover from Sterling Investment Partners. On my beat, covering the health care industry, I was regularly confronted with the realities of staffing shortages and closures stemming in part from private equity firms’ attempts to bring budgets down to cover their debt. And I saw private equity’s obsession with becoming “agile” and “lean” reflected in the way the Department of Government Efficiency has deliriously hacked away at programs it has neither the capacity nor the will to understand. As recounted in Greenwell’s book, stories like these aren’t simply anecdotal. Private equity’s influence on the economy, and our livelihoods, is significant. Twelve million Americans, she writes, work for companies that are owned by private equity. The industry operates 8 percent of private hospitals, four out of five of the largest for-profit day care chains, and currently controls $8.2 trillion in assets—a number that accounts for more than the GDP of any country besides China and the United States. And, where 2 percent of companies go bankrupt within 10 years of their founding, that number jumps to 20 percent when private equity is involved. Between 2009 and 2019, 1.3 million Americans working in retail lost their jobs as a direct result of the industry’s touch. Bad Company offers a few reasons why private equity firms aren’t successfully turning their “distressed assets” around, the most relevant of which is that it pays investors just as well, if not better, to run a company into the ground. (Gordon Gekko’s “Greed is good” speech from the movie Wall Street makes two separate appearances in the book, both entirely appropriate.) Decades of aggressive lobbying and cozy relationships with politicians have favored these firms, which style themselves publicly as “brash swashbucklers, eager to be the hero,” swooping in at their own risk to rescue businesses in distress. But in practice, Greenwell argues, private equity bears vanishingly little risk. And its mandate to not just profit but maximize shareholder value has the effect of abstracting critical industries to a point where, the author writes, “a company doesn’t even need to exist at all.” If reducing the quality of service, selling off real estate, and collecting fees are more profitable than running a successful business, argues Greenwell, “liquidation is not just the best option, but indeed the only one.” Today, when a private equity firm borrows money to “save” a company, the debt is almost always carried not by the firms that purchased a company, but by the company itself. Standard takeover deals include what’s known as a 2-and-20 clause: Funds take a 2 percent management fee of all assets under their control, as well as 20 percent of all profits above a certain threshold. This is in addition, writes Greenwell, to a range of other common payouts, including monitoring and transaction fees. As one team of researchers found over a decade ago, as much as two-thirds of a private equity firm’s profits typically come from these kinds of management fees. Many deploy sale-leaseback arrangements to make a quick buck, selling off property and requiring acquired companies to pay rent on real estate they once owned. And then there are classic cost-saving measures like mass layoffs. “Taken together,” Greenwell writes, “it is very, very difficult for private equity to lose money.” In this context, whether a company provides anything of value beyond dividends to investors is somewhat beside the point. Private equity’s central conceit is that financiers, not skilled workers or industry experts, are best positioned to figure out what makes any given business work. In her reporting, Greenwell makes a detailed argument for the fundamental misguidedness of this stance. Many private equity managers don’t know very much at all about the businesses they run. They’re experts in markets, not trades. So it’s no wonder they hop from industry to industry deploying the same tactics, cutting jobs and saddling companies with debt and inking extractive real estate deals. Hospitals, newspapers, rental apartments, and toy stores have wildly different business models. But to a private equity firm, they’re all the same. Over the course of Bad Company, Greenwell follows four people whose lives have been altered by a private equity takeover. The history and policy analysis act as a scaffolding for these stories; it’s in these intimate portraits that the book truly shines. Though never stated outright, the experiences of Greenwell’s subjects act as a powerful foil to a certain kind of managerial thinking that is implicit at the heart of private equity’s pitch: that profits could only possibly matter to the people in charge of the ledgers, that employees need to be micromanaged, that businesses suffer because of a lack of commitment from the people who clock in and out every day. In other words, Greenwell managed to find a collection of characters utterly devoted to what they do. Liz, an Alaskan mother trying to lift her family out of chronic instability, worked for the retail giant Toys “R” Us, which declared bankruptcy and axed 33,000 employees without severance when private equity–imposed debt made it impossible to keep shelves stocked. Liz loved working at Toys “R” Us so much that she got a tattoo of the company’s signature giraffe. As recounted by Greenwell, after a particularly satisfying customer service experience, a pair of new parents gave their baby her name. A physician named Roger abandoned a cushy job decades ago to practice medicine in rural Wyoming. Now in his eighties and retired, he reflects on his battle to maintain essential medical services, like maternity care, following a series of acquisitions. “You want to leave a place better than you found it,” he tells Greenwell through tears. Natalia, a Texas journalist born in Mexico, ping-ponged between private equity–owned papers, making less than $60,000 a year in Austin and maintaining significant debt to write stories that would resonate with younger, Spanish-speaking audiences. Greenwell also spent time with Loren, a parent whose private equity–backed low-income housing complex flooded, ejecting residents from their homes with no recourse. She is still handing her number out to residents of the building, helping them file complaints from afar. These are not people who need dividends to commit. Throughout Bad Company they find creative ways to circumnavigate the constrictions placed on them by faceless billion-dollar firms. They work longer hours and organize their neighbors. They unionize and campaign. They leverage their tangible connections to their communities to combat people they’ve never met in gleaming Manhattan office towers they’ll never see. In comparison, the copy-paste labor private equity firms perform looks awfully lazy. Intermittently, Bad Company touches on the stories the men in the suits tell one another, and the public, about their critical societal role. “The enduring myth of the lone business genius creating a Fortune 500 company, or saving one from destruction, has benefited private equity immeasurably,” Greenwell writes. She notes that giants of the finance industry like Mitt Romney are rewarded with Senate seats, and that the central branch of the New York Public Library, the MIT computing school, and Yale’s performing arts center all bear the name of Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of Blackstone. The idea that these men are facilitating the process of free-market natural section has contributed to a lack of meaningful regulation—though the donations the private equity industry throws to politicians of both parties certainly don’t hurt. Most memorably, Greenwell describes a Machiavelli quote that once hung in the private conference room of a senior partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the hundred-billion-dollar firm responsible for Toys “R” Us’s leveraged buyout as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of others: “There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its outcome, than to take the lead in introducing a new order of things,” it read. But Greenwell, through her thorough accounting of four companies’ acquisitions and rapid declines, illustrates just how musty that order of things has become, or maybe has always been. Another story the private equity industry likes to tell is that its work is crucial and inevitable, because the companies it acquires suffer from a “failure to thrive” from which there is no turning back. According to this logic, the companies in which Greenwell’s subjects lived and worked were pronounced dead long before funds stepped in to profit from their distress. Toys “R” Us could never survive the shift to e-commerce. Rural hospitals had to consolidate and cut services or face extinction. Declining ad revenue killed journalism. There was simply no other path. But, as Greenwell points out, there are successful retail operations and small hospitals and profitable publications operating in this country today. Many apartment buildings manage to house residents without flooding their apartments or turning off the heat. Extracting every ounce of shareholder value from these companies was far from inevitable—and it’s certainly much harder for an organization to adapt to changing conditions when it’s shedding workers and crippled under a mountain of debt. Of course, it’s impossible to know how any individual company would have fared without private equity’s involvement. Greenwell detours to earlier instances of managerial ineptitude that proved fateful before new ownership stepped in. It could have been in Toys “R” Us’s foolish early deals with Amazon, or the conventional wisdom that underperforming medical centers should slash services, or newspapers’ sluggishness to embrace new models in the digital age. Those were all decisions made by highly paid executives, too. In this sense, Bad Company is a call to bring more creativity and expertise to our country’s critical institutions—to extract them from the hands of people for whom a business isn’t a dynamic entity full of actual people but instead a collection of assets and debts.

Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, and Wall Street is resoundingly bullish on the software giant heading into the results. All 20 analysts covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Their consensus price target around $580 implies 13% upside over Tuesday's close just above $512, after setting a record high Friday at $513.71. Wedbush, which has Microsoft on its "Best Ideas List," recently raised its price target to $600. The company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," Wedbush said, thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and the cloud-computing platform Azure. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, is expected to grow 22% to $28.96 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts have called Microsoft their "top pick," giving it a price target of $613. The bank said Microsoft has pricing and margin power that is "nearly unmatched in enterprise software." Jefferies analysts issued a price target of $600 earlier this month. Analysts on average expect Microsoft to report quarterly revenue of $73.86 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and net income of $25.27 billion, or $3.38 per share, compared to $22.04 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street will be watching for updates on Microsoft's AI spending ambitions in fiscal year 2026, which began this month. In April, CFO Amy Hood said capital expenditures are expected to grow this fiscal year, but at a slower rate than in fiscal 2025. Microsoft at the time said it expected $80 billion of capex in fiscal 2025. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) last week raised its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion. Rival hyperscaler Meta (META), like Microsoft, is set to report earnings after the bell on Wednesday. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are slated to follow a day later.

Title: Here Are Three Questions Investors Want Answered In Big Tech Earnings This Week

Second-quarter earnings season will kick into high gear this week. Four of the world’s largest companies—Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—are set to report their results. Artificial intelligence will be the focus for many investors, who will be hoping for updates on companies' investments in the era-defining technology and how they're using it. But trade policy could also get some airtime, especially during Apple’s and Amazon’s calls on Thursday. Microsoft and Meta kick things off with their reports and earnings calls after the closing bell on Wednesday. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have already turned in results, so after this week the only Magnificent 7 company left to report will be Nvidia (NVDA), in late August. Here are three questions on investors' minds. Six months ago, one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street was whether U.S. tech companies were spending too much on artificial intelligence. That issue appears to be settled—or, at least, on the back burner for now. Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast to $85 billion, citing growing demand for cloud computing products and services; that was generally read as a good thing. Google Cloud grew by more than 30% from the prior year, putting the unit on track to book over $50 billion in revenue within the next year. Cloud computing competitors Microsoft and Amazon could follow Alphabet's lead. Both companies left their capex forecasts unchanged when they reported quarterly results three months ago, decisions that may have been influenced by the trade and economic uncertainty hanging over the market at the time. The companies could be feeling more confident about boosting AI spending now that some of the fog has been lifted by trade agreements. Meta was the odd one out last quarter when it raised its capex outlook. It’s not out of the question that the social media giant will lift its forecast again; it did so in the first and second quarters last year. Investors will be looking for evidence that big investments in AI are paying off. “AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum,” said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Executives said on the company’s earnings call that Google is monetizing AI search results at about the same rate as it is traditional search, and that AI overviews are driving increased search volume. In recent quarters, Meta has convinced Wall Street that AI is improving ad performance and user engagement. Investors are hoping this week’s results continue to demonstrate that Meta's investments are bearing fruit. Amazon could offer updates on how customers are engaging with Rufus, its AI shopping assistant, and Q, its work assistant. Microsoft is likely to elaborate on the uptake of its Copilot AI offering. As for Apple, experts say, investors may still have to wait for the details they crave. “We don't expect (1) an update on Apple Intelligence timing (2026), (2) any material change in quarterly capex, (3) an update on Apple Intelligence approval in China, and/or (4) any new partnership announcements,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an earnings preview last week. Management might, however, say product sales grew faster in Apple Intelligence-enabled regions than non-AI regions, he said. At least in the near term, Apple investors are likely more concerned with tariffs than most of its Magnificent Seven counterparts. President Donald Trump in April exempted smartphones and other consumer electronics from his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, but the president has ordered his administration to consider invoking national security concerns to impose Section 232 duties on smartphones and semiconductors. Section 232 tariffs have held up better in court than Trump’s country-specific duties and could be harder for Apple to avoid. Even with the smartphone exemption, Apple in May estimated tariffs would add $900 million to the company’s costs in the second quarter. Investors will watch for the actual impact and to hear how Apple is engaging with suppliers and the administration to fend off tariffs and mitigate their potential impact. Trade policy will also be top of mind for Amazon investors. In the first quarter, Amazon saw some evidence buyers were stocking up to get ahead of tariffs, which could set the company up for a sequential slowdown in sales. Executives said merchants didn’t meaningfully increase prices in the first quarter, but noted that could change depending on where tariff rates end up.

Middle managers are the talk of corporate America lately — and Business Insider wants to hear about it. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, alongside major retailers like Walmart, are looking for ways to cut costs and streamline bureaucracy. Enter, the Great Flattening: A widespread wipeout of mid-career jobs. Laid-off managers are pushed into a rocky job market, and those who remain employed are left with an increasing number of direct reports. Millennials and Gen X, who hold most of the US' managerial roles, are most impacted. Check out BI's stories about middle managers: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June he plans to shrink the company's white-collar workforce, citing "efficiency gains." After a round of layoffs, Dell told BI in March that "Through an ongoing series of actions, we are becoming a leaner company," which will include combining some teams. And, alongside a bout of Meta layoffs in 2023, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that "flatter is faster." "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," he said. If you are a middle manager — or you report to a middle manager — and are comfortable being interviewed for future reporting, please fill out this quick Google form.

Title: Fast food fixer: 83-year-old Hungry Jack wants a five-minute plan for Domino’s Pizza

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Some Australians might know that the man behind burger chain Hungry Jack’s is Jack Cowin. Another name for him could be Australia’s Burger King, given he owns the local rights to the brand. He has shaped vast swaths of the fast-food landscape, having brought KFC to Australia and being chairman of Domino’s Pizza, in which he is its biggest investor. At 83, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion, you might think the Canadian-born entrepreneur is enjoying retirement. The reality is the opposite. Cowin has taken over chief executive duties at Domino’s following a string of executive exits. The day after the resignation of global chief executive Mark van Dyck (who was seven months into the job) was announced, Cowin hosted a call to field questions from investors and analysts. Make no mistake: Domino’s chairman, now executive chairman, Jack Cowin is calling the shots at the pizza chain.Credit: Dan Peled “This company is not in disarray. The future, in my opinion, is bright,” Cowin declared. “There’s nothing wrong with this base business.” Zooming from his desk in a dark teal jumper, the billionaire businessman conceded a number of key issues that needed to be fixed, picking problems with each departed company chief. He wanted decisions made faster than van Dyck’s plan to do it – in five minutes, preferably, not five years. He also made no secret of his intention to wind back decisions made by van Dyck’s predecessor. “The Don Meij era was growth,” he said. Meij said his reason for leaving was the “sheer intensity” of being at the helm for 22 years. He once topped the charts as the highest-paid ASX chief executive. But under Meij’s watch, Cowin said too many new stores set up in countries such as Luxembourg, France, Japan have been loss-making for too long. “We have to correct that.” From left: Don Meij, Mark van Dyck and Jack Cowin.Credit: Peter Wallis But the conditions for success during that era were some of the best the pizza chain could have wished for. COVID-19 lockdowns keeping everyone at home created huge – but temporary – demand for food delivery. Fast-food customers and investors alike were grabbing a slice of Domino’s, which reached a share price record high of nearly $160 in September 2021. Since then, it hasn’t capitalised on the flash-in-the-pan success. Pizza sales have stalled. Profit predictions were downgraded three times in a year. “It has been this huge growth story for a long time. The last two or three years hasn’t [delivered] any growth,” said Tom Kierath, investment banking firm Barrenjoey’s head of consumer research. Investors fled the stock after van Dyck’s resignation was announced, sending the share price to little over a tenth of that peak to $16.96. Cowin was aware of the need to reassure rattled shareholders, with van Dyck’s departure coming so soon after Meij’s. The billionaire businessman has a personal stake – 25.7 per cent – in fixing this. “The business has got to do better. We’re custodians of other people’s money,” Cowin said. “But to make this business successful, we have to have growth, and we have to do it now rather than on a long-term basis.” Domino’s problems didn’t appear overnight. Many competitive edges that once made it a market leader have eroded over years. Meij sought to make Domino’s website and app best-in-class, spending nearly $23 million in half a year alone on digital platforms. The investment doesn’t appear to have generated high returns. “You had the Peloton bubble, you had the Lululemon bubble with everyone buying casual wear, and we had this Domino’s bubble because they were digitally well advanced beyond anyone else,” said food industry consultant and Titanium Food director Suzee Brain. “That gave them inflated confidence that they were the new flavour of the month. So they started some really massive expansion off the back of a false economy.” The rapid store roll-out across Europe and Asia, once a major sales driver, was reversing. In Australia, Domino’s couldn’t keep the sales spurt they enjoyed during the pandemic. Executive chairman Jack Cowin is unwinding a number of investments decisions made by former CEO Don Meij.Credit: Jamila Toderas “They weren’t able to keep a lot of those customers, because there’s another problem: the product is not all that great,” said Brain. “They’ve never marketed it because they make great pizza … But now, it actually needs to be about the pizza.” Domino’s is facing a more competitive and diverse fast-food landscape in which players such as Guzman y Gomez and El Jannah are attracting younger customers and US chains Five Guys and Wingstop are keen for their slice of the market. As Australia’s dominant pizza chain, industry watchers believe Domino’s must advocate more effectively for the entire pizza category. “As part of your ‘what we do for the kids for a family eating Sunday evening dinner’ [considerations], does Domino’s become part of the conversation more than it currently is? That’s the opportunity,” said one industry analyst who declined to be named. The business must become more profitable, Cowin has told investors. Ideally, this would happen through a sales uplift, but as there’s no guarantee of that, costs need to be pulled out of the business. As delivery aggregators Uber Eats and DoorDash eat Domino’s lunch, IT spending has been an early target. “Our technology is not any better than Uber’s and the other people that we have to deal with,” said Cowin. “If you don’t have a competitive advantage, let’s stop trying to recreate the wheel.” Franchisee profitability is a key priority for Domino’s, with weekly store sales ranging from $30,000 to $100,000, Cowin revealed. But margins were eroded by the spurt of high inflation across ingredients such as cheese as well as wages, fuel and electricity. Meij tried to pass this on by imposing a 6 per cent delivery fee, which backfired with customers who punished the move by buying fewer pizzas. “Relative price point becomes very important,” said Ten Cap co-founder and lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu. “This price increase for the fast-food category was just so wrong.” Several fund managers, stock pickers and analysts believe at least some dead weight needs to be shed. Domino’s should sell France and exit Japan, said outspoken stockbroker Angus Aitken. Barrenjoey’s Keirath agrees. “If they get Taiwan, right, is it going to move the dial? No, it’s becoming a distraction. The same in Malaysia,” he said. “What you do by staying in those markets is you dilute the core markets.” Recruitment is under way for Van Dyck’s replacement. But they will have to be someone who will have to play by the rules laid out by Cowin, who has made it clear he wants to see rapid change. “If you have a strong chair in place [who has] already said to the market, ‘well, that guy is not there because he’s not delivering on costs’, then the next person has to subscribe to that view,” said Ten Cap’s Liu. “When you have to focus on costs, you got to be a tough person. You can’t be a nice guy.” There are plenty who think Domino’s is still a good deal, such as Morningstar equity analyst Johannes Faul, who said the leadership instability has injected uncertainty in the short term but described the pizza chain as “a robust brand of the future”. “We do think Domino’s still has growth ahead of it. Quite significantly so,” Faul said. Aitken said there was still a “huge mass market” for Domino’s products. “The demise of Domino’s as a product is not apparent to us,” he said. “We think backing the No.1 [quick-service restaurant] money-maker over 50 years, when he has no friends, is a great time to back Jack Cowin and Domino’s.” Turning things around could take three years. “Jack might be in his 80s but he is hands-on and can fix this with the right team.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

The question never seems to go away—and the markets, fueled by the so-called “TACO” trade (“Trump always chickens out,” as the acronym goes), are shrugging it all off. But what if Trump calls Wall Street’s bluff? Luckily, there are not one but three ways for us to hedge ourselves from the “TACO trade” going cold. Below, we’ll look at all three and I’ll name my favorite of this trio. Plus we’ll grab ourselves tidy dividends of 7%+, too. If you’re experiencing déjà vu, it’s because this same story happened back in April, and it sent stocks plunging back then. This latest time, however, it’s had little impact at all. But why would stocks sell off based on Powell’s firing in the first place? It’s because of the Federal Reserve’s independence. Its operation of the country’s banking and financial system without intervention from the executive branch has been a mainstay since the central bank’s creation a century ago. And Wall Street wants things to stay that way. So, can we march forward into the future without worrying that Powell will be replaced and a new Fed chair will be inserted who bows to political pressure? This, after all, could increase the odds that interest rates will be cut too much—as low rates are popular—potentially goosing inflation in the process. In the long term, yes—the chances of a “new normal,” where the Fed just does what the president says, are basically zero. But in the short term, a selloff driven by this risk is a distinct possibility. That’s because, over the last few weeks, markets have become increasingly complacent, and stocks have gone from volatile to solidly positive. As I write this, the S&P 500 is up 7.8% for 2025, which is about where it should be, in my view. And I expect it to end 2025 higher still. But the VIX, the market’s “fear gauge,” soared in April, slowly fell back down, and is now a bit lower than where it started the year. In other words, the markets are now saying that stocks are less risky than they were at the start of 2025—even after all the talk about tariffs firing Powell, neither of which have fully gone away. Why? Because now the markets are banking on the TACO trade: If Trump keeps “chickening out,” as the acronym goes, he can be easily ignored. However, this is, paradoxically, a risk. Whatever your politics, it’s undeniable that Trump follows the equity markets and responds to them. Stocks recovered only after Trump backed off on the tariffs in April, which he did only after stocks fell. Stock market performance clearly matters a lot to Trump. As a result, we’re in a weird situation where a continued stock rally could encourage Trump to reverse moves that caused the market to tumble in the past. That would likely cause another drop, which could then prompt Trump to reverse course. As of now, stocks are simply jumping to the last step, rising on the assumption Trump will always back off. Which, ironically, gives him exactly the room he needs to do things that will cause stocks to fall, like firing Powell, for example. It’s all a bit exhausting! But this is where those funds I mentioned earlier come in. Right now, volatility itself is low, and that means any kind of “insurance” on the market hitting another storm is cheaper than normal. The “insurance” I want to tell you about today comes in the form of closed-end funds (CEFs) that buy or sell options on the stocks they hold. Under this strategy, these funds charge a fee, called a “premium,” to option traders for the right to buy the stocks in their portfolios at a fixed date and price in the future. They then use the premiums they collect to fund their dividends, which, as we’ll see shortly, are well north of 7%. This strategy works best in volatile markets—which means today’s lower volatility has put many of our favorite covered-call funds on sale. The three “go-to” covered-call CEFs out there are the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), which, as the name says, holds the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average; the S&P 500–focused Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX); and the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Between them, they provide broad exposure to the biggest companies in America, like Visa (V), Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). In other words, many of the same names you’d get if you bought an index fund. But with this trio, we’re getting much higher yields than any index fund pays. And second, unlike ETFs, CEFs (including these three) can trade at a “discount to NAV,” or net asset value. That’s another way of saying we can buy shares of their portfolios for less than they’re actually worth. Covered Call CEFs QQQX tends to be my favorite of these because it often yields the most and has the highest discount. But right now, it yields essentially the same as DIAX, while DIAX offers a much wider discount. That makes DIAX the best buy of the lot today. SPXX, with its 7.5% yield, isn’t generous enough with its dividend, and its discount of 1.3% is almost nonexistent. So if you want to stay in stocks (or stock-focused funds—which we do!) and hedge for future volatility, DIAX is the way to go. Consider also this chart. DIAX Lags On a NAV basis (or going by the performance of its underlying portfolio), DIAX (in purple above) was pretty closely matching its underlying Dow Jones Industrial Average index (in orange) until late April, when a sudden drop in volatility caused DIAX’s portfolio to underperform, and its underperformance has widened since. That’s an opportunity for a contrarian pickup, especially given the fund’s unusually large discount. DIAX Discount to NAV Back in 2022, when volatility was peaking, DIAX saw a flurry of demand. But as stocks have recovered, more money has flowed to alternatives, setting this fund’s discount roughly between 11% and 13%, where it’s been for over a year now. That’s unusual for DIAX, whose average discount has been 6.7% over the last decade. That makes DIAX a timely contrarian play on a rise in volatility, since its covered-call strategy makes it rise as markets get more skittish—and investors look for more “insurance” from the next big plunge.

Title: Largest Bank in Billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio To Deploy $40,000,000,000 in Excess Capital to Shareholders

Bank of America (BAC) says it has just approved a new multi-billion-dollar stock-buyback program. In a new announcement, the largest bank stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio says its board of directors has approved a $40 billion common stock repurchase program that goes into effect on August 1st. A stock buyback is when a company buys shares of its own stock, reducing the total number of outstanding shares, according to Bankrate. Buybacks are seen as a way to increase value for investors. Says Bank of America, “[Wednesday’s] authorization will continue providing additional capital return flexibility, reflecting the company’s commitment to return to shareholders excess capital that is not needed to support economic growth, deliver for customers and communities, invest in the future and sustain strength and stability through the economic cycle.” The new program replaces the existing program, which had $9.1 billion in common stock repurchases remaining. Bank of America also announced a dividend increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter, for a total of $0.28 per share. The dividend is payable on September 26th to shareholders of record as of September 5th. Bank of America has a market cap of $360.3 billion and is trading for $48.45 per share at time of writing. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 631.57 million shares of Bank of America, its fourth most valuable holding, behind Apple, American Express and Coca Cola.

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, which trades under the ETHA ticker, just became the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion. It reached the milestone in 251 days. And was beat by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund—which did it in 34 days and 53 days, respectively. There was much hand wringing and head scratching on Wall Street when the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 didn’t get the kind of reaction as Bitcoin ETFS did in January 2024. We’re talking $1 billion in trading volume for ETH funds’ debut vs. $4.5 billion for Bitcoin. But investors don’t seem worried or confused now. Looking ahead, there’s reason to believe the growth of crypto ETFs could accelerate even more. Analysts recently told Decrypt that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers are likely to get the nod from the SEC to offer in-kind redemption and creation of shares. That would mean shares could be purchased with BTC or ETH—whichever happens to be the underlying asset—and that investors could receive BTC or ETH when they redeem their shares. The feature is popular with investors, but regulators are concerned the process is complex and could pose security concerns in crypto-based funds. Bitcoin glutton Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is back in the market raising cash to buy even more Bitcoin—this time with a new preferred stock offering that could add another $2.5 billion to its war chest. At the time of writing, Strategy’s 607,770 Bitcoin is currently worth $70.6 billion with a 1,519.17% in unrealized profit after adding another $739.8 million to its holdings on Monday. The company initially said it would raise $500 million with its new Stretch preferred stock offering, selling 5 million shares at $100 a pop. Then news got out (initially reported by Bloomberg) that the company would expand its offering to $2 billion. When the SEC filing finally hit EDGAR on Friday, it became clear the company intends to raise closer to $2.5 billion with its new Stretch preferred stock offering. Meanwhile, there’s a new class‑action lawsuit brewing over how Strategy amended terms for its Strike preferred stock offering. The company acknowledged in a July 21 filing that a plaintiff has filed a class action lawsuit alleging that holders of MSTR common stock ought to have been given a chance to vote on a July 7 amendment made to the Strike offering. Speaking of class action lawsuits: The July 15 deadline has passed for a judge to choose a lead plaintiff in the other Strategy class action lawsuit over statements made by executives about the risks involved in its Bitcoin treasury. Issuing debt to buy Bitcoin hits different when it's a Bitcoin miner. At least that’s what can be deduced from the way MARA Holdings saw its share price tumble when execs announced an $850 million raise on Wednesday. The stock slipped again on Thursday, when an SEC filing revealed the company upsized its offering to $950 million. The BTC the miner already holds in its treasury—second only to Strategy’s stash—is currently worth $5.8 billion. That puts its Bitcoin holdings nearly even with the company’s intraday market cap, which is $6 billion at the time of writing. But the company isn’t just going to buy Bitcoin with the proceeds of its raise. It wrote in its SEC filing that it plans to use a portion of the new cash for “working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of existing assets, and repayment of additional debt and other outstanding obligations.” All told, MARA shares look to be ending the week 12% lower than they started it, having gone from $19.98 per share to $17.15 at the time of writing. But Compass Point analysts see the dip as a minor issue. Early Friday, Compass Point analyst Ed Engel upgraded MARA from Sell to Neutral and nearly doubled his price target from $9.50 to $18. But he did caution in a note shared with Decrypt that the investors should expect to see some “pullback during seasonally weak August.” The upgrade is largely driven by Bitcoin’s recent performance, he added—but that’s not all. “While most miners are transitioning to HPC,” he wrote, referring to high-performance computing, “MARA seems committed to its HODL strategy that prioritizes ATM and convertible debt sales over selling BTC.” He also noted that while the company has increasingly used its BTC holdings in yield-generating strategies—approximately 15%, by Engel's count—”MARA has yet to disclose any ROI.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: California lawmakers urge Trump admin to halt cuts to national labs

View towards Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) at UC Berkeley, a US national lab that conducts scientific research on behalf of the Department Energy. Sundry Photography/Getty Images Stay Connected By Edward Graham Three California Democrats are calling on the Trump administration to reverse course on budget cuts to national laboratories, warning that “American technological, economic, and military superiority will be put at risk if our national labs are not operating at full strength.” In a July 25 letter to Energy Department Secretary Chris Wright and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the lawmakers said that, “due to unlawful reprogramming and the prospect of budget cuts as proposed by this administration’s budget request, labs have already started to lay off employees.” The letter was signed by Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla, along with Rep. Zoe Lofgren. They noted that four of the nation’s 17 labs overseen by Energy are located within their home state of California. “Indeed, we believe the work of the national labs is instrumental in ensuring that the U.S. remains the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence models,” they wrote, adding that the labs provide vital support for U.S. efforts to outpace competitors like China in the development of new capabilities. “As you know, experts in the public and private sectors alike and public officials on both sides of the aisle believe there is tremendous benefit in being the first nation to establish clear global AI dominance.” President Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would slash funding for Energy’s research and development programs, including to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy that oversees labs focused on energy innovation. Several specific labs — such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory — would be in line for significant cuts under the proposed budget. Politico’s E&E News reported on Friday that the director of California’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory told staff that, “as we look ahead to the federal budget for fiscal year 2026, it has become clear that staffing reductions at the lab are unavoidable.” The lawmakers wrote that some labs have also “warned Congress that they may need to start laying off thousands of scientists and technical staff in the near future.” Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., who co-chairs the Senate National Labs Caucus, similarly wrote a letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday that called for him to reverse the proposed cuts in the FY26 budget. Wright previously told Congress last month that he was “very open” to reducing the budget cuts and was “keen” on restoring some funding for national labs. “We agree that the expertise and research efforts of our national labs are invaluable to advancing these critical endeavors, and we were pleased to hear that you also believe that the President’s budget request does not sufficiently account for the critical the work at our national labs,” Schiff, Padilla and Lofgren wrote. Despite the looming threat of budget cuts and workforce reductions, several of the nation’s labs have recently partnered with outside tech firms to enhance their operations. Amazon Web Services and the Idaho National Laboratory announced on Wednesday that they will collaborate to develop AI tools for nuclear energy projects. Microsoft and the Idaho National Laboratory similarly announced on July 16 that they were also partnering to bring AI and cloud-based capabilities into the nuclear permitting and licensing space. Energy also revealed on Thursday that it selected four sites to host new artificial intelligence data centers, including Idaho National Laboratory.

Title: Layoffs surge in tech: More than 100,000 jobs cut in 2025 so far
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/108818-layoffs-surge-tech-more-than-100000-jobs-cut.html

Big quote: As Frank Herbert writes in Dune, "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them." We've now entered the second half of the year, and tech-related layoffs have already skyrocketed past the 100,000 mark. The Bridge Chronicle has compiled a list of the most outstanding mass layoffs announcements from tech companies so far, with the downsizing expected to hit rock bottom by the end of 2025. So far, Intel appears to have the most aggressive job-cutting plan of the year. The US chipmaker recently announced 24,000 job cuts, with even more layoffs expected in the near future. By the end of 2025, "Chipzilla" is projected to have let go of 75,000 core employees worldwide. The company is in a precarious position, facing a continuing decline in PC CPU sales and a strategic pivot toward an AI-focused business model. AI technology is also one of the main drivers behind Microsoft's decision to significantly reduce its workforce. The Redmond-based corporation has so far laid off 15,000 employees, affecting several divisions including cloud, gaming, and hardware. In a recently disclosed company memo, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella attempted to address the "painful" job reductions using convoluted corporate lingo that sounded like it came straight from a heartless (and brainless) chatbot. Rumors suggest Nadella is deeply obsessed with GenAI, reportedly using Copilot for both personal and professional purposes. Microsoft's attempt to justify its latest layoffs is particularly hard to defend, given the company's strong financial performance and lack of any money-related issues. Microsoft slammed for awful AI-generated Xbox job post, weeks after laying off 9,000 workers Other major tech companies – including Meta, Google, Amazon, and Cisco – have also fired or are in the process of firing thousands of employees, reallocating funds to build newer, more powerful AI models and capitalize on the agentic AI hype before it potentially collapses under its own weight. Massive funding efforts to commercialize AI aren't the only factors behind the ongoing layoffs. Big Tech went on a hiring spree during the pandemic a few years ago, betting on a remote work boom and surging demand for tech products – trends that never fully materialized. Much of that bloated workforce is now being trimmed. Additionally, a surge in geopolitical tensions and the persisting uncertainty around Trump-era tariffs are threatening future revenue prospects and prompting further cost-cutting measures. Tech layoffs show AI's impact extends beyond entry-level roles In Japanese corporate culture, CEOs are expected to take significant pay cuts to avoid layoffs. Former Nintendo President and CEO Satoru Iwata famously stated that firing employees sacrifices long-term morale for short-term gains. I'm willing to bet my bank's account that no single CEO in the Western tech business would even consider doing something like that.

Title: Opinion: Wall Street Is Challenging The Low-Cost-Investing Revolution

Ordinary investors have won the battle of fees. The challenge will be holding on to that victory as Wall Street mounts a counteroffensive. Investing today is as easy as opening a free brokerage account and buying a low-cost, commission-free index fund that tracks the broad market, then sitting and marveling as it blossoms. Since I started my first professional job in the mid-1990s, an investment in a cheap S&P 500 Index fund would have grown more than 17-fold, beating virtually every professional investor over that time. For Wall Street, this has meant decades of falling fees, a trend that the industry now sees an opportunity to reverse. Financial firms are leveraging the hype around cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence and private markets to lure investors back into high-priced funds. The campaign will be hard to resist. The Street is skilled at selling speculative, conveniently high-fee investments that promise — but rarely deliver — bigger payoffs than index funds can achieve. And with crypto, AI and private assets, there’s plenty of sizzle. Consider the patterns emerging in exchange-traded funds, an innovation that accelerated the low-cost revolution Vanguard Group Inc. sparked with the launch of the first index fund in the 1970s. The first ETF, State Street Corp.’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, launched in 1993 and is still among the most popular. In fact, the three biggest ETFs are S&P 500 funds with a combined $2 trillion in assets. The draw is an average expense ratio of just 0.05% a year and zero commissions to trade. The ETF revolution was built on a barrage of such low-cost market trackers. ETFs now have a 35% market share of combined US assets in ETFs and open-end mutual funds as of June from less than 1% through the 1990s, according to Morningstar. If the trend continues, there’s little doubt that ETFs will soon be the bigger player. But the products are in danger of losing their edge. The roughly 670 funds that launched in the 1990s and 2000s and are still around today have an asset-weighted average expense ratio of 0.13%, and nearly all of them are index funds. Since then, Wall Street has gradually encroached, turning what was a low-cost index haven into a high-priced casino. The average expense ratio of the 1,200 funds that launched in the 2010s crept up to 0.21%, and the percentage of index funds dipped to 75%. That was just a hint of the coming onslaught. Of the more than 2,500 ETFs that have launched so far this decade, only 25% are index funds. The group’s average expense ratio jumped to 0.39%, nearly matching that of mutual funds, which have been scrambling to lower fees. The direction is unmistakable — and unfavorable for investors. When the 2000s ended, there were only 25 ETFs with an expense ratio of 1% or more. In the 2010s, 73 more appeared. And so far this decade, I count an additional 272 that have already gathered $40 billion in assets. They are almost exclusively the kind of speculative funds you would expect — digital assets, inverse and leveraged, derivatives-based and emerging technologies (read AI). The only ones likely to get rich from these ETFs are the fund companies. More enticements are coming. The White House is reportedly readying an executive order that will open 401(k)s to private assets and cryptocurrencies. The mutual funds in retirement plans are already more expensive than comparable ETFs. Imagine how much more private assets and crypto funds will siphon from workers’ retirement savings. Financial firms that genuinely believe in the investment merit of crypto, AI and private assets should charge fees that are comparable to stock and bond index funds. They’ll still make plenty of money given the popularity of those investments. BlackRock Inc.’s recently launched iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF charges 0.25% a year and is already the firm’s most profitable ETF. There’s no reason why Vanguard’s highly anticipated private asset fund can’t conform to the firm’s low-cost ethos. Whatever happens, investors will still be able to build wealth steadily and reliably with low-cost index funds that track broad markets. They have already served generations of savers faithfully and will continue to — if investors can just overlook Wall Street’s high-priced temptations.

Title: Nothing Phone 3 Review: A Quirky and Fun Phone for Photographers
URL: https://petapixel.com/2025/07/25/nothing-phone-3-review-a-quirky-and-fun-phone-for-photographers/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T17:43:35Z
Full Content:
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. As a brand hailing from Britain, Nothing has been around since 2020, and the Phone 3 is its first true flagship aimed at taking on the best in the industry. The company’s name is a wide-open door for puns, but nevertheless, Nothing could be a serious contender in the Android space going forward. Its current rise reminds me a lot of the earlier years of OnePlus, which isn’t all that surprising since both were founded by the same man, Carl Pei. He left OnePlus and started up Nothing as a grassroots alternative in a similar vein. This is a first for me, as I hadn’t tested a Nothing phone prior to this, and one with a daring camera setup makes for an ideal start. The Phone 3 is readily available in North America starting at $800, yet also has the pedigree of Chinese brands to some extent. How it all comes together yields intriguing and vexing results. The Phone 3’s physical design is open to interpretation. Does it look like a science experiment or a crafty take on otherwise common builds from others? For my eyes, it’s a unique look that’s easy enough to cover up with a case if a little too eccentric, though I personally don’t mind it at all. I also appreciate that Nothing includes a basic silicone case in the box to add some protection from the start, retaining the transparent back’s visibility with Gorilla Glass Victus offering its own layer of durability. Another unique element is the small red square that is actually an LED that lights up when recording video. One of the standout design elements is what Nothing calls its Glyph Interface, a circular LED display on the top corner that functions almost as an independent system. By default, it tells the time, stopwatch, and timer, battery level, and an odd spin-the-bottle game. It can do much more when making adjustments in the settings to include volume indicators, charging progress, and tying certain glyph animations to specific apps. For instance, you have one for WhatsApp, another for Uber, and yet another for email. I wasn’t able to create one for the Camera app that actually worked, so it’s more of a boon to the rest of the phone. Certainly a gimmicky feature, to a degree, but I’ve grown to like it because it makes it easier to leave the phone face down. The fact I can also set a “rule” for an animation to pop up when a specific contact messages me is convenient, though my smartwatch can effectively do the same thing in real time. On the flip side, the 6.77-inch AMOLED display (2800 x 1260) is gorgeous, with an adaptive refresh rate that will ramp up to 120Hz or down to 10Hz depending on what you’re doing onscreen. Peak brightness (for HDR content) hits 4,500 nits. While pretty visible in bright sunlight, it’s also fairly reflective, so a mixed bag in that regard. A responsive fingerprint sensor makes it relatively easy to bypass the lock screen. With IP68 dust and water resistance, this is Nothing’s first phone you can submerge in clear water, making it far less risky to capture some stills or clips at a pool or lake. Nothing also makes a curious choice to go with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor over the 8 Elite other Android flagships adopted this year. Indeed, Qualcomm refers to the 8s Gen 4 chip as an “affordable flagship”, which is marketing speak for a step down in performance, but it’s also more in line with other devices in this price range. A 5,150mAh battery is adequate for a device this size, and it holds up quite well in daily real-world conditions, consistently lasting a full day. Configurations start at 12GB of RAM and 256GB and go up to 16GB and 512GB, respectively. The 50-megapixel main camera (24mm equivalent) uses the same OmniVision OV50H Type 1/1.3-inch sensor as the Vivo X Fold 3 and Honor Magic 7 Pro. The f/1.7 aperture is also in line with both devices, so we have an idea of what to expect from it. Unless you shoot at full resolution, all photos are downsampled to 12.5 megapixels through pixel binning. The 50-megapixel telephoto (70mm equivalent) goes with the Samsung Isocell JN5 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with f/2.7 aperture — one we’ve seen in a myriad of phones over the last three years. In certain modes, Nothing offers a 6x hybrid zoom 140mm equivalent that’s basically a crop of the telephoto’s focal range. While you can shoot at full resolution at 3x (70mm), you can’t do it zooming in further than that. Otherwise, you have to settle for pixel-binned 12.5-megapixel shots. Finally, the 50-megapixel ultra-wide uses the Samsung Isocell JN1 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, a sensor that is fairly common among other brands. Unlike the other two rear lenses, this one isn’t stabilized and is fixed focus, limiting its versatility. This also applies to the 50-megapixel front camera, which uses the exact same sensor and specs. Instead of a separate mode for shooting full-resolution images, you select the resolution from the drop-down menu. The problem is that it inevitably resets to the lower resolution after a while with no warning, so if you’re walking around snapping photos along the way, you’re forced to double-check that 50MP capture is still active. This happened to me a few times, and I was lucky enough to catch it without losing the high-res capture I wanted. Unfortunately, that’s the only way to go full-res, since Expert mode only lets you shoot in RAW with pixel binning. This can pay dividends in low-light conditions, but otherwise feels pointless in brighter settings or when capturing a dramatic landscape. For a flagship, it feels far too limiting. Nothing presents a few interesting software elements that can affect how you take photos with the Phone 3. Tap the bottom arrow in the camera app, and various presets appear in a menu, including Black and White Film, Retro, Soft Focus, and Lenticular. What’s really neat is it lets you import or create your own. To import, simply scan the QR code to add it to the list. Another way is to create a .cube file to bring in a LUT or preset from apps like Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve (among others) by uploading it directly from the phone’s camera app. Simply select the filter menu from the drop-down menu, tap the + icon and you have the ability to bring it in, either from local storage or pulled in from Google Drive. Yet another option is to create a preset from any photo, even if you’ve transferred or downloaded it from elsewhere. Why make all this available? The phone’s Gallery app has a decent editing toolset, except it lacks any sort of curve tool or deeper color grading. I tried this out in different ways, one of which was to use the Gallery app first, upload to Lightroom to work on the finer details more accurately, and then download the result back to the phone. That way, I could create a preset using the color grading that the phone and its imaging pipeline would then work to emulate. While not a perfect solution, it is one of the more interesting methodologies I’ve seen that caters to mobile photographers of all stripes. It’s also the most creative outlet in a device that otherwise ignores AI-driven editing features or special modes. The Phone 3 isn’t devoid of AI, however, and one feature tied to the Essential Key — the button under the power button on the phone — is applicable to photography. Press the button with anything onscreen and you can write down a note or ask a question for context. This is great for two reasons. First, it makes it a lot easier to snap a quick photo as a reminder or to look something up. Second, it opens up access to contextual information with the assistance of ChatGPT. To test out a good example, I used a photo I took of the lunar eclipse and asked it when the next eclipse would be. It then listed the upcoming dates for both partial and full lunar eclipses based on my location. It’s true that Google’s Circle to Search essentially does the same thing, only the key difference here is that all of these Essential Key screenshots save to the Essential Spaces app. It essentially (pun intended) acts as an offline resource that’s always there to reference anytime. Granted, it’s far from perfect, as evidenced by the fact that it doesn’t always offer much insight, but it can be great at helping find information. On the other hand, ask it to suggest how to make a photo look better, and it won’t offer much insight at all. I will address the two main sticking points for the camera before discussing the positives. There’s a noticeable shutter lag that afflicts every mode except Action and Video. In some cases, it’s so bad that it can take up to two full seconds before it snaps the image. It’s also inconsistent in ways that are hard to discern or explain. I could never figure out why it would be slow to capture a photo in outdoor settings, only to feel much more instantaneous when taking other shots in the same general area. I will update this review once Nothing responds to queries, but if I were to take a stab at it, I would guess that the HDR processing engine immediately sets how many images it needs to quickly snap and merge. The other issue is lens flare and ghosting. Nothing needs to look at whatever coating it’s using for the Phone 3’s lenses because it happens in varying scenarios where it doesn’t impact other phones in the same spots. The photo of the rabbit is a good example of how it can create glare that not only hazes the composition but also plants ugly ghosting in the frame. All I was trying to do was lower the perspective to get a more interesting shot, but the flaring never let up. Meanwhile, two competitors’ phones didn’t seem to suffer from the same problem. Nothing has just released a firmware update to improve its Ultra XDR processing and address this issue. I’ll update this review if that leads to better results. Those two significant drawbacks aside, the Phone 3 surprised me in good ways, with the Action mode turning out to be one of the biggest gems. Nothing wisely offers it in both the main and telephoto cameras, and much like other competing phones with a similar feature, the idea here is to increase shutter speed and utilize HDR processing to manipulate both ISO and virtual aperture to freeze everything. Tougher lighting conditions get in the way, yet broad daylight can lead to fabulous results. The skateboarder is a good example — not only did I take the shot with the telephoto lens, I also cropped in further and retained good detail. Action doesn’t support burst shooting (only Photo mode does), but quickly tapping the shutter can deliver multiple good shots. Equally impressive is the way the Phone 3 handles HDR, although time of day and light exposure play a significant role. It may struggle to pull out the blues in the sky on a bright sunny vista, only to then wonderfully subdue the sun’s intensity in a horizon sunset. When it works well, you love having that kind of power in your pocket, despite how it cuts both ways. One thing I appreciate is that the Phone 3 handles exposed light sources well enough to avoid outright clipping or underexposing shadows — again, owing to the Ultra XDR’s efficacy. However, the angle is your only real defense against flare or glare creeping in, so tilting ever so slightly might be enough to ward it off in those instances because it can happen indoors or outdoors. General results will look great on a phone screen, though you may notice more imperfections when pixel peeping. It’s one of those things where really good photos are obvious and forgettable clunkers equally so. That’s not to say the Phone 3 is inconsistent, more that it nudges you to use some of the available tools to close the gap. The telephoto lens is a great example of what I’m referring to, mainly because it sometimes captures brilliance and then mediocrity all in one sitting. It impresses more often than not, but I would like to see more consistency. For one thing, you could take two shots from the same vantage point and come out with different color tones in each. Blue skies are the most obvious example of when this happens, though other rich examples, like foliage, vehicles, and graffiti, can lead to similar results. Despite all that, I leaned heavily on the telephoto to get me the shots I wanted from a distance. Even the 10x hybrid zoom (240mm equivalent) can produce a decent result with the help of AI Zoom when it kicks in. It also doubles as a macro shooter and accords itself well in that role. Rich and detailed, it’s one of the more surprising elements to the broader camera system. This ultra-wide sensor has been around for a while, and it shows. The lack of both OIS and broader focusing tend to affect performance but it’s more that the XDR processing just isn’t as effective here. While it is a 50-megapixel sensor, Nothing doesn’t let you shoot with it in full-res where you might salvage some detail in good lighting. Apart from the LUTs and presets, this is one of the main anchors for the camera system. It can produce action shots that simply aren’t possible on an iPhone or Samsung phone without doing a lot more work. Action mode takes both multiple photos and a super short video clip in the backend to help render a still that freezes a subject in motion. We’ve seen this sort of thing from OnePlus, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor before, but it’s yet to truly catch on from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google. As I noted earlier, it’s also the fastest shutter available on the camera app. Rapidly pressing the button enables you to capture the action in fairly short intervals — under a second long — to increase the chance of capturing something dynamic. The one caveat is the subject’s speed. People and (most) animals are easier, whereas objects can be tougher to precisely nail down at higher velocities. Mind you, distance also matters like it does with any action photography, so the same rules generally apply here, too. In low-light conditions, including indoors, you have to watch out for ramped-up ISO to offset the higher shutter speed, which could lead to a noisier result. I focused more on still photography, but also tried out video. For whatever reason, Nothing doesn’t enable using the same LUTs and presets to capture footage. Select a preset, and it reverts right back to Photo mode. Otherwise, you can record in 4K or Full HD resolution at 30p or 60p frame rates. The only other video modes are Slo-Mo and Time-lapse. Video quality is quite good in ideal settings, and with HDR mode, you have the option to record in H.265 for extra control in post-production, if desired. The Nothing Phone 3 is in an interesting spot. The brand doesn’t have the kind of imaging partnerships Chinese brands have, nor is it a household name in North America like the Big 3. NothingOS is one of the best Android overlays I’ve seen for the simple fact it strongly resembles stock Android. The build quality and hardware are solid, and battery life is excellent, so this phone ticks off a lot of the right boxes. I can understand how some might view the cameras as a drag on the overall package, especially given the competition at similar prices. But for an upstart brand trying its hand at a flagship, this is a very good debut. I tested the Nothing Phone 3 at the same time as the Vivo X200 FE, and the latter proved to be a more capable shooter in varying circumstances. On the flip side, NothingOS is a pleasure compared to Funtouch OS. The OnePlus 13R is closer in both price and performance in that it lacks Hasselblad’s input, and is a worthy option given how good OxygenOS is as an Android overlay. The Xiaomi 15 may cost a bit more but it retains many of the imaging trappings of the Ultra model. The upcoming Xiaomi 15T Pro (or something similar) may also be in the same wheelhouse. The Honor 400 is compelling as a cheaper option — except if you want a telephoto lens, get the Pro version. Maybe. NothingOS is a draw for sure because software is so vitally important to our daily interactions with phones. It’s not clear how much Nothing will try to fix on the camera side through further updates but if you like something fun and quirky, the Phone 3 is it.

Title: The S&P 500 is ‘extremely concentrated,’ Apollo economist says, warning the best AI investment may not be in the Magnificent 7

Full Content:
Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. It’s time to question the soundness of continued zealous investment in the Magnificent Seven, one top economist warns. The S&P 500 has become “extremely concentrated,” with the top 10 stocks contributing 54% of market returns since January 2021, Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk said in a Friday blog post. With the cluster of tech stocks at the top beginning to unravel, he is pouring cold water on continued aggressive investment in the index and in the Magnificent Seven. “The textbook idea that the S&P 500 gives you a diversified exposure to risk is just simply no longer the case,” Sløk told Fortune. “You are very focused and concentrated in a small group of names, in particular in tech, making up such a significant share of your overall risk exposure.” The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 now prop up 40% of the index’s market capitalization—more than 30% of which is from the Mag Seven—meaning the fortune of the markets has become increasingly reliant on investor optimism about AI. Alphabet’s AI rally not only helped mint CEO Sundar Pichai as a billionaire, for example, but the Google parent’s earnings beat gave the S&P 500 its fourth consecutive record close on Thursday. But as the AI bubble swells larger than the IT bubble a quarter-century ago, as Sløk has previously noted, the extreme hype around the technology risks creating even broader economic consequences than the dotcom crisis. To protect one’s individual investments, now is the time to reconsider pouring money into the Mag Seven, Sløk argued. “One should have some exposure to the S&P 500 and should certainly also have some exposure to AI,” Sløk said. “But it’s very clear that [owing to] the market’s extreme focus and concentration on this story, this is the time to have a conversation around, What are the things I should be doing with my money?” Mounting concerns over the ramifications of a growing AI bubble coincide with the unraveling of the Magnificent Seven stocks. “We’re beginning to have conversations about the ‘Magnificent Six,’ maybe it’s only five,” Sløk said. “This is also just telling you that the Magnificent Seven are seven very, very different companies that have very different businesses.” Popularized in 2023 by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett, the “Magnificent Seven” term acknowledged a group of companies alike in their goal of pushing toward an AI future, but these seven firms, once in lockstep, are beginning to diverge in their levels of success and areas of investment. Apple, for example, has lagged behind competitors like Microsoft and Meta in developing AI products and services. With its stock down about 12% year to date, some market watchers have called for CEO Tim Cook to step down, despite Cook’s boosting the stock price by nearly 1,500% over the past decade-plus. Tesla has meanwhile failed to deliver on promises of autonomous driving, continuing this week its streak of sales misses and disappointing quarters. Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly 15% in 2025 as investor confidence in CEO Elon Musk continues to be tested. Nvidia this month became the first publicly traded company with a more than $4 trillion valuation as its stock price surged by approximately 1,460% over the past five years. The company is expected to see strong sales growth, despite increasing competitive pressures. Ahead of next week’s earnings reports for Meta, Apple, and Microsoft, analysts are continuing to scrutinize the pricing of these companies’ stocks, assessing if there are other options in the tech sector worth buying into. “AI will continue to have a dramatic impact on all our lives,” Sløk wrote in his blog post. “But the question remains whether the Magnificent Seven are correctly priced, and if they will even be the best AI investments over the next five to 10 years.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: How A Podcast "Created Lot Of Problems" For Diamond Comics Bankruptcy

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: dennis barger, diamond The Diamond Comic Distributors' Chapter 11 bankruptcy court transcripts reveal the how a podcast "created a lot of problems" Transcripts of previous court sessions in the Diamond Comic Distributors Chapter 11 bankruptcy case have been unsealed. And, amongst other things, concern the appearance of Alliance Entertainment (or AENT) CEO Bruce Ogilvie on the Industry Of Comics comic book retailer podcast withBryan McClay, Dennis Barger and Jesse James. And how it may have created complications for AENT's initial auction win. When the Diamond Chapter 11 Bankruptcy auction at Raymond James offices was finalised, the winner was announced as Alliance Entertainment/AENT. Bruce Ogilvie, AENT chairman, was then invited onto the podcast after, apparently, watching my performance on it the previous week, talking about the Diamond situation. He also talked about the company, how he came independently to the Diamond auction, why he bid what he did, how the auction went, and his plans for Diamond as the winner. But then suddenly Diamond declared that the back-up bidders Universal Alliance and Pop Sparkle were the winners instead, and it descended into court reversals, lawsuits, and accusations, which are still playing out now. AENT, after being confirmed as the winner by the courts, withdrew from buying Diamond a short time later, claiming fraud, and has now launched a lawsuit for costs. On the 7th of April, Diamond Comic Distributor Inc, the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Diamond Comics were represented in court by Mark Minuti of Saul Ewing, Alliance Entertainment or AENT, represented by Jason Teele, the Creditors' Committee represented by Gianfranco Finizio, and the DIP lender JPMorgan Chase, represented by Katherine Culbertson, with other creditors such as The Pokémon Company International and Bandai Namco present. Again, we returned to AENT, winning the auction and beating out Universal Distribution and Ad Populum. Only for disputes over the inclusion, or not, of $4.3 million in prepaid inventory, leading to the debtor's decision to proceed with Universal and Ad Populum as the "highest and best" bid. We know that AENT win this court battle, before rejecting their victory shortly afterwards. Bleeding Cool has previously reported on the impact this podcast made, now we have cold hard proof in terms of witnesses taking the stand, with allegations that he essentially spoke out of turn, before the details of the sale had been finalized, and caused disruption in the comic book community. Robert Gorin of the Debtors took to the stand and talked about his reaction to seeing Bruce Ogilvie talk about his win, publicly. "So the day after the auction ends, that very next day, chairman of Alliance goes on a video on YouTube for a transaction that's not yet papered and starts talking about plans of what's going to happen. That created a lot of problems — as an operator, that created a lot of issues based on the messages that were interpreted, that were heard, that were said on that call. One was a conversation about consolidating warehouses. So the current organisation has five warehouses, and there was a conversation with the chairman about consolidating warehouses. As you can imagine, the calls started to come in from employees: Am I out of work? Do I not have a job? I don't understand. I'm very concerned… And so now, at a time when the company is very vulnerable, we're trying desperately to keep this thing together, we're really continuing to kind of almost duct tape the aeroplane while we're flying it, if you will. Now we have a lot of noise that we got to deal with. Retailers are calling the company and saying, I've got to get my stuff within a certain period of time. I need it in 24 to 48 hours upon my order. If you're going to consolidate, how are you going to get it to me that quickly? And so it created those issues. And then vendors wanted to know, are you still doing business with me, you're consolidating, the video was unclear about our comic, are you moving forward in the comic book world and what we call floppies. And, you know, with that, the employees on the print side want to know, do I have a job? And it's a really tough conversation when you're trying to convince somebody to continue to work, to be motivated, that this is ultimately a very good thing. And they're seeing this externally, and they're saying, I don't even know if I'm going to have a job. What am I supposed to do now? Should I immediately go out and start to look for a job? And so it created a lot of distraction, heartache, and I'll call it lack of focus within the organisation." In later testimony, he broke these down a little. "First of all, we don't have an agreement papered, right? We don't even have a draft…. Second of all, there was conversation about what went on in the auction that was not necessarily public information that I don't know needed to be shared. The chairman started to give opinions of what he thought was going to happen, even saying, "I'm not very familiar with comics, that's not something I'm well-versed in, I don't know the company very well, but clearly they're not doing it right because look where they are". And he began to give opinions about, for instance, the warehouses. He talked about price points and mentioned, we don't really want to deal in five-dollar price points. Most comic books are under $5 so that created an atmosphere of, well that means he's not going to do comic books. If he wants 15, $20 price points and above, he's not really interested in doing comic books, that's a fair piece of our business." It is something that did cause some consternation at the time, it's true. Gorin continued, "He talked about the collectible grading business. He said he didn't really know a lot about it. He said that they didn't visit that site… the basic message was that they had messed up the grading business somehow. The general indication was that there was a real problem there, but indicating that he hadn't spent a lot of time on it." And there was Free Comic Book Day, with Gorin revealing his own comic book history. "Your Honor, as a long-time comic book collector, it's a big day. You wait in line, you go, and you wait in line… There could be, you know, a couple hundred people in line. And it's an exciting day. And I think retailers have come to value it significantly. And that's one of the biggest questions we've received since this whole thing started: what about Free Comic Book Day? That's going to continue, right? I mean, that's one of the biggest questions we've received." And Gorin did not like what Ogilvie said about it at all. "He says that it clearly hasn't been monetized correctly, you haven't made any money on it. I believe there's a statement along the lines of "there's no free CD or free record album day" or something along the line that caused both the staff that work on Free Comic Book Day, and retailers to really become concerned that this was not part of the future, that this would not continue." Then there were the warehouses. "He used Amazon as an example and talked about how you want to have one big warehouse rather than having multiple small warehouses, and the scale and scope and benefit that gives you. Well, at the current time, we have five warehouses spread across the country. And they're spread strategically so that when an order is received, particularly on the Alliance game side, any order can be delivered to any retailer within 48 hours, 24 to 48 hours. And so the concept of now consolidating warehouses into potentially one large warehouse had the retailers concerned because now retailers closer to where the warehouse is situated have a potential advantage over other retailers." Also the Diamond staff. "It creates concern because now employees are wondering if they should stay. And that became a very loud topic within the company. Do I stay? Do I leave? You know, I have to take care of my family. If I don't have a job, you know, within a few weeks, I need to do something about that. Do I leave? You know, I have to take care of my family. If I don't have a job, you know, within a few weeks, I need to do something about that. It created concern with vendors saying, well, I can't really tell what your business model's going to be going forward. Maybe it's not a good idea for me to continue selling you product, which makes it difficult to then supply product to the retailer. So it created a lot of noise and a lot of distraction at a time when we're trying to be hyper-focused, we're trying to keep this organisation running as best we can, so that the next version of the organisation can blossom. Created concern for me that perhaps, you know, other backup bidders might say you've now had loss of value, your sales could be potentially down, or you don't have the same relationships… because they're distributors, they're selling relationships. And now all of those relationships are in flux because people are not sure, they can't have a fulsome conversation with the relationships on the other side, with third parties. It was a difficult few days from an operational perspective." In cross-examination from AENT's lawyer, Gorin stated that it wasn't the podcast per se that caused all the issues but that, "some of the items that I talked about predate the auction. And when you look at all these individually, okay, things happen. But when you start to add them all up, you get a feeling… I said that in my best business judgment, adding all of those things together, the best opportunity to close was the backup." And he did admit that as a result of the podcast, he wasn't aware of any employees quitting, retailers stopping selling Diamond products, or vendors stopping doing business with Diamond, just that it created "angst in the marketplace and within the company, it created additional noise that we had to deal with above and beyond the day-to-day running of the company. And already holding everything together with the concerns that were out there, it magnified the concerns." In later testimony, Gorin said that his concern was for employees being worried about their job, and it wasn't just the podcast reach, it was, well, me. A bit. "First of all, there were articles published about that. People download the podcast, and pieces of it were being shared. There were summaries that were being shared, you know, people who were watching it and sending around salient points that they thought were critical for various employees or etcetera to understand that was being shared. So the damage was well beyond the number of people who watched the podcast." Apparently, a tree falling in a forest does make a sound, even if there are only a few hundred views of it on YouTube.

Title: Calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter – analyst

Update font size. Reset A Wall Street analyst advises caution on Apple stock due to the company’s unclear artificial intelligence strategy, particularly in generative AI. Needham’s Laura Martin warns that Apple risks lagging behind Big Tech competitors if it doesn’t clarify its AI approach, potentially jeopardizing Tim Cook’s job. Patrick Seitz for Investor’s Business Daily: ‎ “Apple must articulate a GenAI action plan,” Martin said in a client note Friday. “Apple is 1-2 years behind its Big Tech competitors, so any GenAI plan will be expensive to catch up through higher costs to the P&L and higher capex, and maybe even an acquisition.” Further, if it doesn’t act, tech talent will leave Apple to work for big players in artificial intelligence such as Meta Platforms, OpenAI, Anthropic and others, she said. “We believe that Apple’s share price will fall once investors understand the investment levels required to catch up with the other Big Tech conglomerates that were early adopters of GenAI,” Martin said. Lack of a clear AI strategy could even cost Chief Executive Tim Cook his job, she said. “Press and Wall Street’s calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter that Apple doesn’t lay out a comprehensive GenAI strategy,” Martin said. “With Apple shares down 14% year to date (vs S&P 500 up 8%), it’s clear to us that investors are insisting that Apple get off the sidelines.” ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Not loud enough, yet. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Apple won’t get serious about fixing itself until it can figure out how to do so by way of obnoxious leftwing virtue signaling. Analysts always conveniently dish up anything they like to account for stocks going up or down. In this case the analyst conveniently ignores the effects on Apple stock of tariffs imposted by the tangerine tyrant. If the haters want to get rid of Tim Cook the path forward is easy for them. Buy up a majority of Apple stock and vote him out. Calls getting louder …. predictable. That is what whiners do. No facts required. The guy that many here pushed as a candidate to lead Apple is currently presiding over an implosion in his company, with stock plummeting 21.7% so far this year, with no turnaround in sight. He’s also a known drug addict, philanderer, and had a major falling out with the POTUS. This beleaguered cyte has a worse track record than Steve Jobs in picking effective long term leaders. The other guy some other out-of-touch people keep bringing up was an arrogant ass who, after bungling Maps and blaming others, finally got himself canned. No other tech firm hired him, and he’s been out of the industry for many years. Sorry but production of a play doesn’t quite impress on a resume for someone who wants to run a multinational corporation. Who’s the “known drug addict, philanderer and faller-out?” It sure appears TC is the subject, but you’re bringing news with those nouns. Let’s not forget; in addition to the “many here,” Jobs picked The Cyte (is that supposed to be derogatory?) and both figures have effectively been the leaders of the once richest co of the World. You don’t like Mr. Broadway either. Prescience and brilliance almost requires you make public who the next, best and inevitable leader is to be? Who’s a whiner? I’m not a fan of The Cell either, btw. I think he was referring to Musk, since before the anti-Cook campaign here , MDN spent ridiculous amount of time lionizing the dude. Not sure why anyone would follow that wacked so-called genius. That “wicked so-called genius” is building rockets to Mars. Now tell us, Mr. Genius, have you done anything compared to that? Moron. Musk, the man with conviction that many seem to dislike, IS a genius. To say otherwise and to besmirch him displays allegiance to a paradigm despite his achievements of excellence. Space-craft, AI, motor vehicles, land boring/infrastructure, disability solutions, financial solutions, community media. Reported recently is his following the puck, with purchase of an energy company. AI and some crypto services will require energy needs way beyond current supply. What a dummy, he is. Except for Boring (which I don’t understand as revolutionary), his pressing the boundaries in EVERY one of his business, but you’re disturbed by an entity “lionizing” him. I have a feeling you might be suffering from The Syndrome? Did your Musk antipathy coincide with his partnership with the Orange-Man Bad’s campaign and perhaps were tickled before with his clean-energy magic carpets? Meanwhile carnage of AAPL’s forays into advance tech litters the horizon. BUT, Apple Pay remains and its capturing the the World. It’s only a matter of time before he goes. However the question arises as to how much more damage he will cause to the company its innovation and product line. It’s not just Tim Cook who needs to be replaced.he’s populated the senior positions with those who seem to lack the vision for innovation and are content to keep on leveraging the revenue from an existing product range until it runs out Nokia Ericsson Motorola etc the difference is Steve jobs and Johny Ive gifted Cooke a range of products to play with so he can continue the game longer. It’s time to go now and he should show some respect for the customers and investors. Investors are fluid individuals and may be willing to extract as much value as long as the party lasts before moving on. Pity this company and brand has a long way to go with the rights leadership As an add on maybe it’s time to invite Elon Musk on to the the board of apple get rid of the woke nonsense get back to basic innovation and brain storming and sideline the Oscar’s as this seems to be Tim Cookes main driver. Is it worthy of celebration the F1 is scoring well at the box office but apple intelligence and Siri are completely stalled?Just look at the headlines on Macdaily for the last month how many refer to movies and tv shows this website is not Variety it’s a site promoting a technology servicing company – many will say this is not what apple is but whatever Tim Cook has tried to create because of his distaste of innovators and lack of understanding it’s not a film and to business. Ti Musk can’t even focus on his own company. No way that Apple’s core base would support him. Nor can Tim Cook be a least Musk is innovative as a board member he’ll galvanise it or rallies it better than sinking out of inactivity intrangience and a complete lack of understanding of what’s needed TIM COOK: “LIKE COLBERT SAID TO TRUMP…. GO FSCK YOURSELF!” Why so angry! This is what’s wrong in the World now. If you are this angry about a forum disagreement the rest of you life must be miserable. It is clear that Apple needs new direction from a Product Guy not a Logistics Guy! There has been some innovation but not in the right places. Tim likes movies and TV shows not computers.

Title: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol made 6,666 times more than the median employee at his coffee chain last year

Chris Morris is a contributing writer at Fortune, covering everything from general business news to the video game and theme park industries. It’s a good time to be a CEO. A new study by the AFL-CIO found the average corporate leader saw their compensation increase by $1.24 million last year. On average, the federation of unions says, CEOs at the nation’s largest companies made 285 times what the average worker did. A year ago, that ratio was 268:1. “The median employee would have had to start working in 1740 to earn what the average CEO received in 2024,” the organization wrote in its 2025 Executive Paywatch study. CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 over the prior year, with the average S&P 500 leader earning $18.9 million, the highest amount on record. (The previous high was set in 2021, coming in at $18.3 million.) In the past decade, CEOs in the S&P 500 have seen their salaries go up by an average of $6.5 million. Workers last year saw an average 3% raise, the organization says. Among S&P 500 companies, the largest disparity between CEO and median worker pay was at Starbucks. While the average worker took home $14,674, according to the study, CEO Brian Niccol received $97.8 million in total compensation. That works out to 6,666 times more than workers and comes as the coffee-shop employees seek to form a union. Axon Enterprise CEO Patrick Smith topped the pay list overall, though, with the CEO of the Taser manufacturer receiving compensation of $164.5 million in 2024 – a ratio of 801:1. The report highlighted the Trump tax cut package in its report, noting that the average CEO would receive a tax cut of nearly $490,000 due to the extension of Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Workers will see their tax bill go down an average of $765. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: How to Advertise Your Business with a $500 Budget

Written by Asif Ali You want more customers, and you’re ready to advertise your business. But how should you do it? There’s Google Ads. Instagram. Flyers. Billboards. TikTok. And dozens of other online and offline options. Some deliver better results than others: But that doesn’t mean they’ll work for you: You have to find the right channels for your business, not just the ones that are popular. At the agencies I’ve worked with, I’d often see small businesses like auto repair shops and restaurants boost ad returns by 50-200% — just by switching to better-fit channels. In this guide, I’ll help you pinpoint the winning channels for your business — the ones that can unlock real revenue potential. I’ll go through it step by step in three phases, covering: And I’ll show you exactly how I’d do it if I had a starting budget of $500. Note: Want a quick list of ad ideas? Grab this free sheet with 30 ways to promote your business. There are dozens of channels you can use to advertise your business. But unless you have a lot of time and budget, you can’t be everywhere. In this phase, we’ll find out which ones are actually worth testing for your business. I’ll use a local furniture store as a running example. But you can follow the same steps no matter what you sell. Let’s start with the step most people skip: If you’re short on time and want results fast, paid ads can absolutely work. But that doesn’t mean they’re the best move right now. Think of it like this: Ideally, you’d do both. Paid gets you quick wins, while organic builds trust and visibility in the long run. But when you’re working with limited time and budget, you’ll need to choose: (Check out our ultimate SEO tutorial to get started with organic marketing.) If you’re ready to move forward with ads, let’s lock in your #1 goal. You can’t run effective ad campaigns until you know what you want it to achieve. Your goal decides everything, from where you advertise to what your ad looks like. One goal = one outcome = one high-converting ad. Not “get more attention.” Not “build awareness.” We’re talking actual business outcomes, like: Can ads do more than one thing? Sure. But when you’re starting out, trying to get five outcomes with one campaign just spreads your budget thin and hurts your ROI. So pick one. Ask yourself: “When someone sees my ad, what’s the one action I want them to take?” Let’s say I run a local furniture store. I’m not trying to sell sofas online, I just want people to visit the showroom. That’s my goal, and everything in the ad should lead there. Make yours just as clear (and measurable). Pro tip: Use the SMART framework to help you choose the right goal. Before you spend a dollar, look at how your last 20-30 customers found you. Because chances are, your next customers will come from the same places. Here’s how to do it: You’re looking for repeat mentions, or anything that stands out. For example: If 12 out of 30 found you on Google? That’s a sign to use Google Ads. If multiple people say they found you on Instagram? That’s your sign to create ads on Instagram. If you don’t have the answers yet, start collecting data now. Ask every new lead: “How did you hear about us?” Track the next 30 manually. Write each one down in Google Sheets or Docs. Here’s what that might look like for my local furniture store: Note: If you’re a brand new business with zero customers, clearly you won’t have any data yet. You can still use advertising channels, but your market research and competitor analysis (see below) will become even more important. Your competitors are already advertising. Which means they’ve already spent time and money figuring out what works. So instead of guessing, reverse engineer them. Here’s how it might look for my local furniture store: One competitor sends weekly promo postcards. Another runs billboard ads on the freeway and has flyers at the nearby mall. That tells me they’re spending heavily on local print and outdoor ads (and likely getting results from it). I won’t copy them blindly. But I’ll take notes: Then I’ll go online. I’ll start by manually checking if my competitors are running ads on major platforms. Many ad platforms have public ad libraries you can search. Like Google’s Ad transparency, where I can see if my competitors are running ads on Google Search, Google Shopping, and YouTube: I can also look up their Instagram or Facebook ads in Meta’s Ad Library: TikTok, LinkedIn, and Pinterest have similar ad libraries. I’ll go to each one manually and check what they’re running. If I want to save time and go deeper, I’ll use a tool like Semrush’s Advertising Research. I simply plug in my competitor’s domain and instantly see: All the keywords they’re bidding on in Google Ads and how much they’re paying per click: The exact text they’re using in their ads: And what landing pages they’re using in their campaigns: To analyze competitors’ display and social ads, I’ll use the AdClarity App. It shows how much they’re spending and how visible those ads are: It also shows what kind of ad creatives they’re using: Both tools give me a sharper picture of what’s working in my niche. If I’m researching just one or two competitors, I’ll stick to manual checks. But if I’ve got five, seven, or more? I’ll use Semrush. It saves time, and it surfaces details I’d miss on my own. Once I’ve gathered everything, it’s time to look for overlap: Let’s say two of my top competitors are running Google Ads for “recliner sofa,” and both are pushing showroom visits in their CTAs. That’s a clue that these ads drive in-store visits that lead to sales. Or maybe I notice all three competitors are mailing out seasonal promo postcards. That’s not something I planned to do. But if everyone’s doing it, there’s probably a reason. This is how to use competitor data to narrow down which channels are actually worth testing. Pro tip: Use our free Google Ads competitor analysis tool if your rivals are using search ads. Before you finalize your three channels, sanity-check them. Just because a platform is popular doesn’t mean your audience is paying attention there. You need to use what you know about your ideal customer’s habits to spot the right fit for your business specifically. For instance, for my furniture store, let’s say I know that most of my buyers are homeowners in their 40s or 50s shopping for higher-ticket items. (Ideally, you’ll have internal data to help here, but tools like Semrush can help here with their demographics feature.) Based on that insight, they’re probably searching on Google, browsing Facebook, checking mailers, and listening to local radio. Not scrolling Snapchat or TikTok. So I’ll cross those off my list, and I’ll focus on the ones that match how they already consume info. To validate that, I’ll use Semrush’s Audience Intelligence app. The tool’s Online Habits report shows when my audience is most active and how likely they are to use each social network. Meanwhile, the Media Affinity report shows which offline sources (e.g., newspapers, radio, and magazines) they pay attention to. It also shows what kinds of online media they prefer: If I see strong signals around Google and local news (but nothing for Instagram or YouTube), I know which channels belong on my list. That way, I’m picking channels based on actual behavior, not assumptions. You’ve done the research. Now it’s time to lock in your top three channels. Pick channels that line up with your goal, your audience’s behavior, and what’s already working for others in your space. And make sure they fit your budget. For example, some competitors can afford to run full-page ads in The New Yorker, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Or they may run radio ads that can cost up to $1400 for a 30-second spot, depending on the state. That’s fine if you’ve got the budget and it’s where your target audience is reading or listening. But if not, skip it. Remember: in this guide, we’re working with a $500 test budget. For my furniture store, I’m going with: Write yours down. These are the first three channels you’ll test. Need help choosing your three ad channels? We put together a detailed prompt you can upload to Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT. It’ll ask you a few questions, then suggest three ad channels that fit your business, goals, and budget. It’s not a replacement for manual research. But it can help you move faster, with a starting plan that actually makes sense. Download the prompt file and drop it into your LLM tool to get started. Note: This works best with reasoning models. In this phase, you’ll choose what to promote, craft your offer, build the ads, and launch your first campaign. Here’s what this process looks like at a glance: I’m working with a small $500 budget, and I’m treating this as a live test. The goal: get your ads live, see how people respond, and make sure everything runs the way it should. Before you build anything, learn how your three chosen channels actually work. You don’t need to master everything. But you do need to know: That’s how you avoid beginner mistakes to launch campaigns that achieve positive ROI. (And save you from wasting time and money.) Let me walk you through the three channels I picked. Google search ads appear when someone actively searches for something you sell. For example, I can bid on the keyword “buy recliner sofa queens.” This way, whenever someone searches this phrase, my ad might appear. Google search ads follow the pay-per-click (PPC) model. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad. These are great for local businesses. Why? Because they let you show up right when someone’s actively looking to buy. But to make them work, you need to know the basics, like: Further reading: How to Use Keyword Match Types in Google Ads In my example, I also chose Facebook for one of my channels. But Facebook and Instagram both use the same Meta ad platform. So I can run one ad and show it on both platforms if I want. Instead of targeting keywords (like Google Ads), you can reach people based on: You can choose from image ads, videos, carousels, or Stories. Meta lets you set your own budget and charges you per result (like per click, impression, or DM). Before you run your ad, there are a few things you should understand to ensure good ROI: Postcard campaigns are straightforward. You create a physical card, choose the delivery area (like ZIP codes or neighborhoods), and send it to local homes through a provider like USPS Every Door Direct Mail or FedEx. But to get real results, you need to understand the fundamentals: This is one of the simplest ways to advertise your business locally if you’re trying to drive foot traffic fast. Some channels are simple. Like designing a flyer and dropping it off. Others take more time and practice to get right. Like running Meta ads or setting up Google Ads campaigns. You don’t need to master every feature. But you do need a handle on how your chosen channels actually work. That way, your campaign isn’t based on guessing. It’s grounded in real data. That’s why I’ve put together a free resource library with guides for all major channels. This will help you get up to speed with how each channel works. Download the free resource library with curated guides for popular ad channels. Don’t try to promote everything all at once. When you focus on one product or service, everything gets easier — from writing the ad to measuring results. Pick something simple, proven, and easy to sell. Ideally: For my furniture store, I might go with loft chairs. They’re popular and high-margin. And one of my competitors is promoting them in Google ads: You can test other products later. But for your first campaign, keep it focused. Even the best ad won’t work if there’s no reason to act. That’s what your offer does. It gives people a reason to click, call, or visit now — not “later.” Great offers are: For my furniture store, I’ll offer “25% off all loft chairs until Sunday, June 22, while stock lasts.” Like this competitor does: It’s clear. It’s specific. And it makes people move. A lot of small businesses don’t want to cut into their margins. That’s totally fair. There are plenty of other ways to make your offer feel urgent, without lowering your price. You could offer: Write down your offer clearly before you move on. This is what you’ll build your ad around. Every ad needs one clear next step. Click. Call. Visit. Book. Not all four. Just one. For my furniture store, I want people in my showroom. So across Google Ads, Facebook, and postcards, the action would be the same: to get directions to my store. One of my competitors does this with Google ads: Whatever action you choose, make it obvious. This is where it all comes together — your channel, your offer, and your CTA. Now you decide the ad format, write the copy, and choose (or design) the visuals. For my furniture store, I’m running three ads across three channels: Google Search, Facebook, and postcards. On Google, I’ll keep it tight. The ad will match what someone’s searching for. Like “recliner chairs near me.” The headline? Something like: “20% Off Loft Chairs – This Week Only.” The description line makes it actionable: “Visit our showroom in Queens. Free parking. Sale ends Sunday.” No fluff. Just keywords + urgency + next step. On Facebook, I’ll go visual. I’ll use a clean image of the actual loft chair in a styled room. The headline might match the offer (“20% Off Loft Chairs”) and the text could highlight one feature. Like “Reclines fully, fits small spaces.” The CTA button would be something like “Get Directions.” Like this: For postcards, I’ll design it around simplicity. Large product photo. Bold offer right up top. Short subtext that reinforces the benefit. And the bottom section will show store hours, our address, and a small map. No matter the channel, the roles of each part of your ad are the same: If anything’s vague, crowded, or trying to do too much, it gets ignored. So before you launch, ask yourself: If the answer isn’t yes within 3 seconds, it’s not ready yet. But if it is ready, it’s now time to work out how to get the most out of your ad budget. Not every advertising channel costs the same to get results. And not every channel works the same way. That’s why you don’t want to split your $500 evenly. Instead, think through each channel using three simple questions: Let’s walk through my setup. For my ads on three channels, here’s how I’d split the budget: Google Ads: $250 People are literally searching for what I sell. So the intent is high — and I want to show up. But clicks cost more here. $1.11 is the average cost per click for a keyword like “buy lounge chair.” Just to give you a sense of scale: If I spend $250 at $1.11 per click, I’ll get roughly 225 clicks. (This is an estimate. CPC is an average, not a fixed price per click.) And if just 5% of those people visit the showroom, that’s 11 visits. That’s why I’m putting the biggest share of my budget here. It costs more to show up, but the intent is also higher. And that makes it worth testing. Facebook Ads: $130-$150 I can reach local homeowners for less on Facebook than I can on Google Ads. These ads aren’t as targeted by intent, but they’re great for visuals and awareness. I’ll test a couple of versions to see what lands. Postcards: $100-$120 These have a flat cost with no bidding to worry about. I’ll send around 500 cards to homes near the store and track if anyone brings one in. This will cost me approximately $115 to print at FedEx. Will this split be perfect? No. But that’s not the point. You’re not trying to get every dollar “right.” You’re testing to see which channel shows real promise. Then you can double down in the next round with more data, more confidence, and better returns. You’ve built the ads. You’ve set your budget. Now it’s time to launch. And when you do, launch everything at once. Here’s why: If your Google ads go live on Monday, your Facebook ads on Wednesday, and postcards land the week after, that’s three different tests. You won’t know what’s working and what’s just a matter of timing. Launching all campaigns within the same 1-2 day window gives you a clean read. Same market. Same conditions. Real signals. That means: And once they’re live, don’t touch anything. No tweaking. No pausing. No panic edits. You’ll optimize later. In the next phase, you’ll learn how to track the results and double down on what’s working. Note: Setting up and launching your first ad campaign takes time. It has a steep learning curve and can feel overwhelming. Here are a few things that’ll make it easier: Your ads are live. The budget’s spent. This phase is simple: Check your results, keep what worked, and fix or cut what didn’t. Over the next few steps, you’ll learn how to track, compare, improve, and reallocate budget across your three channels. This will help ensure your next ad campaign achieves better ROI (and avoid you wasting money). Don’t try to measure everything. Just focus on the one action you wanted each ad to drive. For my furniture store, here’s what I’m tracking: Log your results in a simple spreadsheet, and check once a day for 14 days. Two weeks should give your ads enough time to generate meaningful data for this small $500 budget. Here’s how my spreadsheet might look: Ad platforms generally provide detailed campaign reports that show metrics like clicks, impressions, cost, and more. Like Google Ads: And Facebook: If you’re running offline ads, they’re harder to measure. But here’s what I’ve seen work: You don’t need a fancy tool — just a clear record of what happened. Because you’ll need that data to figure out what paid off, and what didn’t. We’ll get into that next. You’ve seen what happened. Now it’s time to make sense of it. Ask this question: Was this ad worth my money? Let’s say, for my furniture store: Let’s say 10 of those visits turned into customers, and each sale averaged $350. That’s around $3,500 in revenue from a $500 budget. If I have a 30% profit margin, that’s $1,050 in profit. This isn’t deep analytics. It’s a simple check to understand your ROI. Later, as you test more channels and scale up your spend, you’ll want better tracking systems. But for your first campaign, this level of insight is enough. Next, we’ll figure out why certain channels didn’t perform and what to do about them. Some ads hit. Some didn’t. That’s normal. The important part is knowing why. Because a low-performing channel doesn’t always mean it was the wrong channel. It might just mean the message was off. Or the audience was too broad. Or the offer didn’t land. In my experience working with clients, there are four main reasons an ad doesn’t perform: Go back to your underperforming ads and assess them against these factors. Write down where the breakdown likely happened. And don’t just look at what failed: do the same for what worked. For my Google Search ads, here’s what likely helped: For my postcards campaign, here’s what may have held it back: Don’t guess. Use your campaign data to spot friction and fix it before the next round. Your sprint 1 campaign is done. Now it’s time to level up. You’ve seen what worked. You’ve seen what didn’t. Here’s what you’ll typically do in the second sprint: In my case, for my next cycle, I’ll: And I’m going to increase my budget to $1,000. Because now I know what works, I’m comfortable putting in more. Eventually, as every subsequent sprint improves based on data, we’ll optimize our ads even further. And with that, our ROI will go up.

Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed Intel logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/ File Photo Intel shares sank 8 per cent on Friday after the company warned of exiting chip manufacturing if it fails to secure a major customer, a potentially drastic move by the new CEO to cut spending and revive the struggling American icon. Lip-Bu Tan said on Thursday he would further shrink Intel's workforce, halt work on two plants in Europe and slow another in Ohio, binning his ousted predecessor's strategy that relied on building costly facilities to restore its manufacturing edge. The plan for such extreme measures follows a surprise second-quarter adjusted loss and a forecast for a bigger-than-expected loss in the third quarter. The weakening financials pointed to more trouble for Intel after years of mismanagement eroded its PC and datacenter market share and left it with almost no presence in the AI market.

Title: ‘The Daily Show’s Future, Cable Networks’ Fate, And 6 More Questions Facing Paramount & Skydance Post-Merger
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/07/the-daily-show-cable-tv-networks-paramount-skydance-merger-1236467952/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T00:27:30Z
Full Content:
By Dade Hayes Business Editor After a long, complicated slog toward Thursday’s FCC approval, Paramount Global and Skydance Media will now face a number of tricky questions in becoming one company. While the $8 billion-plus transaction will need a few more days to become official, several strategic dilemmas already have been percolating. Here are the biggest questions the new leadership will have to answer: Staffers at Paramount already have been staggered by multiple rounds of layoffs, which saw 15% of U.S. employees trimmed in the final months of 2024 and another 3.5% let go last month. Those reductions, though, were in pursuit of a stated goal to achieve $500 million in cost savings. Execs at Skydance and its financial backer RedBird Capital say they have identified about $2 billion in savings once the two companies come together. That kind of slim-down is likely to affect a large swath of the 18,600 global employees Paramount had at the end of 2024. Watch on Deadline RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN & More When other bidders were jockeying with Skydance, some of them – notably Sony Pictures in partnership with private equity giant Apollo Global – were viewed as worse options in terms of job preservation. Surely, a Sony-Apollo takeover could have threatened the future of Paramount Pictures and its storied Melrose lot, and the duplication on the studio side surely would have left thousands without jobs. And yet Skydance might still end up as less of the savior it was seen as initially, depending on the extent of the cuts. As it has lost tens of millions of households due to cord-cutting in recent years, Paramount’s linear cable business has become a growing concern for investors. Media industry peers like NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. Discovery and A+E Global Media are in various stages of separating or exploring strategic options for their linear holdings. Now that the Skydance deal is done, the cable portfolio — consisting of brands like BET, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount Network — is likely to leave the fold in some fashion. Jeff Shell, CEO-in-waiting for the new entity, has been bullish on linear TV’s future thanks to demand for sports. Broadcast and streaming will serve as the two weighted ends of what Shell has called a “barbell” of revenue, separated by the skinny bar of cable networks. “For a lot of us, we thought broadcast would decline along with cable five years ago,” the exec told investors in July 2024. “That simply hasn’t happened.” RELATED: Jeff Shell Faces Scrutiny Over Past Conduct As Top Paramount Job Looms Prior to the proposed Skydance transaction, Paramount had explored selling BET (including its studio and streaming service) as well as Showtime. Former CEO Bob Bakish’s falling-out with Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, which led to his ouster in the spring of 2024, was caused in part by his rejection of a $3 billion offer for Showtime. The premium network wound up being merged with Paramount+ and lost much of its original value. Despite Shell’s optimism, Naveen Sarma, managing director at S&P Global Ratings, has warned that linear will continue to be an albatross for Paramount. “Maybe Skydance will have a strategy that addresses some of that, but over the next, call it, year or so, year and a half,” he said in December. “We’re going to see a company that’s going to go through a lot of upheaval because of the transaction.” “I’m not going anywhere, I think,” Jon Stewart said on Monday’s episode of The Daily Show after a particularly long rant about corporate capitulation to “Lord Farquaad.” However, given Paramount’s cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (“purely a financial decision,” per CBS), Daily Show staffers clearly are concerned that the Comedy Central show could be next. The show is currently on a hot streak in terms of ratings and awards nominations, and perhaps more importantly, one would imagine that if such a plan was in the works, Chris McCarthy, one of the outgoing Co-CEOs of Paramount Global, would have made a similar move to his colleague George Cheeks and done it before the deal was approved by the FCC. RELATED: ‘The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart Torches Paramount Over Colbert Axing: “Go F*ck Yourself” It’s clear that late-night is in a bad place, but one thing going for The Daily Show is that other than a handful of animated shows (South Park, Andy Samberg’s Digman! and a new season of Beavis & Butt-head), Comedy Central doesn’t have a great deal of original programming to satisfy its parent company’s carriage agreements. “Comedy Central is kind of like Muzak at this point. I think we’re the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park,” Stewart added. The merger will bring Skydance Television into the Paramount Global fold, which already includes CBS Studios, MTV Entertainment Studios — which produces all Taylor Sheridan series and Emily in Paris — and BET Studios. Some consolidation is expected. Led by David Stapf, CBS Studios, which absorbed Paramount TV Studios in 2024, has a distinct broadcast focus as the main supplier of CBS. Paramount Global co-CEO Cheeks, President of CBS, who is expected to stay put in the post-merger Paramount, is believed to be high on both Stapf and CBS Entertainment President Amy Reisenbach, so CBS Studios is expected to carry on. RELATED: Paramount Using Taylor Sheridan, 101 Studios Relationship As Model For Success Says Co-CEO It is unclear how exactly the rest of the production units will shake out, but Skydance Television President Matt Thunell is poised for a leadership role at a combined TV banner that may carry the Paramount moniker. As for Sheridan, with Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy, who oversees MTV Entertainment Studios, set to depart, one of his top lieutenants, Keith Cox, who already works closely with the prolific creator, could become his point executive. A few key posts have been determined, with Netflix vet Cindy Holland coming in to oversee streaming and Skydance Chief Creative Officer Dana Strong in line to take over Paramount Pictures. Deadline is hearing of a couple more changes. Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group Co-President Josh Greenstein is rumored to be entering talks for a role in the new corporate hierarchy. Skydance couldn’t go into talks with Greenstein, who is a close associate of Skydance CEO David Ellison’s, until the merger was approved. Following the exit McCarthy, Nina L. Diaz, Chief Creative Officer and President of Content for Showtime/MTV Entertainment, is expected to exit also. Even more than South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who clinched a mega-deal with Paramount this week, the primary creative voice associated with Paramount Global is Sheridan. The Yellowstone creator has generated billions in value for the company, though observers both inside and out have wondered about the future of the relationship given the changing of the guard. RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Sheridan has been accustomed to working with large budgets, which surely will go under the microscope, as is the case anytime new owners take over. When Discovery merged with WarnerMedia in 2022, JJ Abrams’ lavish $250 million, five-year deal immediately became a topic. The parties wound up agreeing to a shorter two-year deal in 2024. Any radical change in the Sheridan universe won’t come anytime soon, given that he has several years left on his current deal. But the producer would have plenty of options for a new home down the line, given the aggressive spending by Apple, Amazon and Netflix of late. One widely anticipated change would see Paramount+ move closer together in the organization with Pluto TV, its free, ad-supported sibling. Such a move would save considerable costs in many departments. Those kinds of larger shifts aren’t primarily what Holland is being brought in to do. Plus, Pluto doesn’t have original programming. Holland, who teamed with Ted Sarandos to launch Netflix’s original programming more than a decade ago, already has been working behind the scenes to put together a slate. Her main mission will be to give Paramount+ more of an identity. While it has grown to 79 million subscribers, the “news, sports and a mountain of entertainment” marketing handle has been a frustratingly apt description of its uneven assortment of fare.

As advertisers and viewers continue to flock to streaming, though, a rebooted tech stack alone won’t get the service where it needs to be. Could they? Yes. Will they? Likely not. A clause in the 11-year rights deal CBS signed with the NFL in 2021 could be triggered with the merger, allowing the league to renegotiate given the change in control of the company. Questions had swirled about that doomsday scenario in 2024, with Commissioner Roger Goodell’s ambiguous remarks on the matter seeming to add fuel to the speculation.

So I don’t anticipate that [opting out is] something that we’ll see. We have a two-year period to make that decision. I don’t see that happening, but we have that option.” Peter White, Anthony D’Alessandro and Nellie Andreeva contributed to this report. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Watch Colbert back on The Daily Show or Comedy Central at least. Thanks to union rules about pay, network television is far more costly to produce than basic cable.

Just rebrand and fold everything into Paramount name. Streamline it. Paramount and CBS the network should be the only general entertainment brands. Sunset Pluto and Skydance names. Bring back the Showtime name but keep all the programming like Dexter for P+, bundle it with MTV Networks – VH1, BET, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon – and spin off and sell as husks of their former selves to air old movies and shows. Paramount doesn’t need Nickelodeon. It’s a tainted brand. Take all the Nickelodeon characters like Rugrats and Sponge Bob and just fold them into Paramount Kids.

The company founded by Jeff Bezos is at the heart of the technological revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) driving its transformation. And with this evolution comes the demand for new profiles and salary changes. According to information shared by Amazon with the U.S. government and reported by Business Insider, these are the salaries received by software engineers, data scientists, product managers, financial analysts, and artificial intelligence experts. Software engineers remain the backbone of Amazon’s technological operations, especially in key divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Data Services, and the Amazon Development Center US. The latest data shows the following base salary ranges: These figures correspond to foreign employees hired in the United States in the first quarter of 2025 and do not include variable compensation such as bonuses, stock options, or additional benefits. Data scientists play a key role in developing intelligent products, optimizing logistics processes, and personalizing user experiences. Their salaries reflect that importance: Although Amazon does not publicly list all salaries related to AI, positions such as Applied Scientist and Solutions Architect indicate the compensation levels the company offers: In addition to engineers and scientists, Amazon generously compensates professionals who lead and analyze tech projects: Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, stated clearly that AI will lead to layoffs, but also spark a wave of new hiring, especially in areas like robotics, data science, and machine learning. In a June 2025 memo, Jassy encouraged employees to “use and experiment with AI whenever possible”, which sparked controversy among workers—especially since, in some Amazon subsidiaries, AI usage is now a mandatory criterion for promotions, according to Business Insider. In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon hired approximately 11,300 foreign workers. Information from Business Insider Cancela en cualquier momento Acceso exclusivo a rankings y radiografías.
