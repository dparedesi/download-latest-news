We recently published a list of 11 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) stands against other best NASDAQ penny stocks to buy right now. The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world’s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year’s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed’s target. However, he emphasized that the path for monetary policy will be contingent upon incoming economic data. He underscored the uncertainty of the economic outlook, noting, “If we’ve learned anything over the past five years, it’s that the outlook remains highly uncertain.” READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market. Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Most Profitable Food Stocks To Invest In. Recent trends indicate a strong push towards sustainability within the plastics sector. Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.

Title: Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout Pause Likely Due to Liquidity Factors and Nvidia's Stalled Rally
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/11/bitcoin-s-100-k-breakout-pause-likely-due-to-liquidity-factors-and-nvidias-stalled-rally
Time Published: 2024-12-11T06:49:14Z
Full Content:
For the third week, bitcoin (BTC) remains locked in a price range between $90,000 and $100,000, punctuated only by Dec. 5's short-lived rise into six figures.This indecisive price action might have left traders feeling uninspired, with two key reasons holding back the upside. First, the influx of liquidity into the crypto market through channels like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has significantly slowed, taking the wind out of the bullish momentum. The weekly rate of change in the so-called market liquidity impulse index, which tracks stablecoin mints, inflows into BTC ETFs and changes in futures market parameters, has more than halved to $7 billion from highs above $15 billion seen early last month, according to data tracked by 10x Research. "This slowdown in liquidity growth may partially explain why bitcoin is struggling to sustain levels above $100,000," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Wednesday. The liquidity indicator has chalked out lower highs of late, diverging bearishly from BTC's price. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. Meanwhile, ETFs are preferred investment vehicles for those looking to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. The same can be said about CME's cash-settled futures. The other reason, overlooked by most pundits, is the slowdown in the uptrend in shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), the world's biggest company. Since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022, NVDA has emerged as a bellwether for all things AI and risk assets in general. BTC and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and boasted a strong positive correlation since then, barring the summer, when supply overhang fears kept BTC from tracking NVDA higher. As of writing, the three-month correlation between the two was 0.6. Analysts at TheMarketEar believe BTC, with its post-U.S. election surge from $70,000 to $100,000, has caught up with NVDA "Same psychology; winners like winners. BTC has 'caught up' to NVDA. They have little fundamentals in common but are driven by similar psychology," analysts at TheMarketEar said in a note to clients, adding that NVDA is one of the few stocks that has outperformed BTC this year and over the last five years. While BTC has risen 130% this year, NVDA has gained 172%, according to data source TradingView. NVDA's uptrend, however, has run out of steam since mid-November, with prices now teasing a bearish reversal pattern for heads and shoulders. Besides, the one-year put-call skew now shows calls trading at par with puts, exhibiting a neutral sentiment as opposed to a strong call (bullish) bias early this year, according to data source Market Chameleon. That said, bullish excesses have been crowded out from the crypto market, as noted in Tuesday's edition of the Crypto Daybook Americas. With the market normalized to more healthy leverage levels, we could see BTC having another go at the $100,000 mark, but sustainability of the breakout likely depends on liquidity inflows and broader risk sentiment.

The company’s net income fell to $183 million, primarily impacted by production outages and higher ethylene feedstock costs. Westlake Corporation (NYSE:WLK) is actively pursuing cost savings initiatives, achieving approximately $35 million in savings during the third quarter alone. This brings the total savings for the year to about $120 million, moving toward their goal of $125 million to $150 million for 2024.

In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants.

On December 9, JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained an Overweight rating on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $210. With the technology company set to report its earnings on Thursday, the firm remains bullish on the stock on the back of a strong demand profile for AI products, continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets, and unlocked VMWare revenue synergy. Sur affirmed that software renewals from major corporate customers will lead to strong growth in the VMWare business, a cloud computing technology company that Broadcom acquired in November 2023. Overall, the analyst projects revenue and EPS upside for the full year, continued strong demand for AI products, and a coordinated end market recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets for fiscal year 2025. With a $30 billion pipeline of AI revenue opportunities per AI customer over the next 4-5 years, and strong VMWare momentum, Sur projects strong dividend growth and sustained AI leadership for the company. “Broadcom is set to report October quarter (F4Q24) earnings Thursday, and we continued to see a strong demand profile for its AI products combined with continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets (e.g., enterprise, server/storage) and VMWare revenue synergy unlock.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is IonQ, Inc. (IONQ) the Best Quantum Computing Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) stands against the other quantum computing stocks. Quantum computing stocks are once again in focus after yesterday's major breakthrough announcement by one of the biggest players in this field. Investors have had high expectations from quantum computing firms for many years, but the technology has consistently failed to deliver on the promise. However, a deeper understanding of the tech behind quantum computing is required to fully understand the complexity of the issue. Quantum computers were theorized in the 1980s, but their development has been fraught with challenges due to the fragility of qubits. Unlike traditional computers that use binary bits, like ones and zeroes, quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Qubit fragility typically leads to higher error rates for quantum computers. Companies have tried to address qubit fragility through innovations — ranging from light particles to trapped ions, but few have been successful. However, latest breakthroughs in this field herald the arrival of quantum supremacy - a term used to explain the processing power of quantum computers compared to traditional ones. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Since the latest breakthroughs showcase that quantum computers can accomplish tasks in minutes that would otherwise take ten septillion years - exceeding the age of the universe - it would be reasonable to assume that quantum computers can now move on from accomplishing mundane tasks like generating random numbers or solving specific mathematical problems, towards practical applications in drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and cryptography. This has huge implications for investors who are increasingly frustrated by the plateauing advancement in the field of AI and are actively exploring for emerging opportunities in the tech field that offer explosive growth potential along the same lines. Sylvia Jablonski, the CEO of Defiance ETFs, appeared on news platform CNBC earlier this year to highlight this. “The way I see markets today is the absolute fervor and interest in all things A.I. and A.I. is the tide that rises all boats. I think quantum is the next generation of A.I. You need it to process data and make changes in all of the sectors we have been talking about that A.I. has been impacting with drug discovery and curing diseases. Just as AI is powering progress in not just the computer industry, but in fields that adopt the use of AI, quantum computing will be used in processing data for sectors already being transformed by AI, such as drug discovery and curing diseases.” Read more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected quantum computing stocks by sifting through the holdings of popular quantum computing ETFs. The stocks listed below are also popular among hedge funds.

A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17 IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) engages in the development of general-purpose quantum computing systems in the United States. The surging investor interest in quantum computing has helped push the shares up by close to 200% year-to-date. It is one of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds as it offers pure exposure to the quantum industry and has demonstrated stronger commercial traction. For example, in the third quarter, the company posted a revenue of $12.4 million, up more than 102% year-on-year. This performance was driven by over $63 million in new bookings by the quantum computing firm, including a $54 million contract with the US Air Force Research Lab to develop networked quantum systems. The quantum computers marketed by the firm make use of trapped ion quantum computing technology. This offers high stability and connectivity between qubits. Unlike traditional computers, which use binary units to process data, qubits process the zeroes and ones of binary units simultaneously. This speeds up processing times. To put this into context, the latest Forte Enterprise system marketed by IonQ can process 34 billion scenarios simultaneously. IonQ has also been expanding partnerships with major companies to gain mainstream recognition. For example, the firm recently announced that it would partner with pharma giant AstraZeneca to develop quantum applications for drug discovery and development. Earlier, it had also announced a deal with software firm Ansys to bring quantum applications to computer-aided engineering. Most recently, the quantum computing company revealed that it would be purchasing Qubitekk, a firm that designs, builds and integrates the hardware and software for quantum networks. Overall IONQ ranks 6th on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of IONQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IONQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A data analyst pouring over a chart, the intricacies of its lines being revealed. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2 Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) is an integrated photonics company that offers accessible and affordable quantum machines. Even though the firm is small, with a market capitalization of around $880 million, it is one of the best quantum computing stocks according to hedge funds. One of the reasons for this is the significant momentum behind the stock, with shares rallying close to 750% so far this year, as investors bet big on the company to deliver on the promises of quantum technologies and products under development. In late November, the firm announced that it had secured two orders for the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip foundry. TFLN is a cutting edge material used in high-powered computers. This material operates with an extremely high bandwidth and with lower insertion losses, and is likely to be a key enabler of the 1.6 and 3.2 terabit optical switches and interconnects used by hyperscalers in their AI data centers. TFLN is presently only sourced in small quantities from China. However, Quantum Computing plans to open a fully commissioned TFLN fabrication facility in Arizona by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The firm stated in a policy paper published earlier this year that once the facility is functional, it would become the only company in the United States capable of processing 150 mm wafers. TFLN chips can be used for a variety of purposes, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, high-frequency modulators, and LiDAR. Overall QUBT ranks 10th on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of QUBT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: West Palm Beach Sees Retail Real Estate Boom Thanks to Influx of New Residents
URL: http://wwd.com/business-news/real-estate/west-palm-beach-retail-real-estate-boom-new-residents-1236753965/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily COVID-19 drove a surge in newcomers to the area, and real estate companies are rapidly developing new residences, office buildings and hospitality and retail properties. Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates the island of Palm Beach from the city of West Palm Beach on the mainland, once cut a clear demarcation between the haves and have-nots. But their metaphorical distance creeps closer each year with the island’s geographic limitations and West Palm Beach’s transformation into a happening, waterfront destination for millionaires, and perhaps even billionaires, to live, work and play. “It started before COVID[-19], but then COVID[-19] turbocharged everything,” said Jordan Bargas, senior vice president of development for West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Related Ross, regarding the rampant development of luxury residences; office buildings, especially for wealth management firms, and upscale restaurants and retail, often imported from New York and Miami that cater to the nascent “Wall Street South” crowd, among a tidal wave of multigenerational newcomers. Related Articles Architecture Italian Luxury Furniture-maker Natuzzi Forays Into Private Residential With Dubai Residence Real Estate Tanger Posts Solid Q3 Results, Raises 2024 Guidance Again “South Flagler House, our property under construction that’s designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects with units averaging $15 million, is the perfect example of people who live on the island and are purchasing in West Palm Beach now. Previously, they wouldn’t have been caught dead here,” he added. You May Also Like Workers at the city’s new and slated financial tenants including Goldman Sachs, Elliott, JPMorgan Chase, Millennium, BlackRock and Point72 also desire homes in planned, high-end projects here, from Mr. C Residences to The Ritz-Carlton Residences. Economic research firm TPX projects Vanderbilt University’s pending downtown satellite campus will add another 35,000 local jobs within a quarter century. The school’s staff, along with its nearly 1,000 graduate program students, will need housing too. The shift toward more discerning residents means apartment rentals like Related Ross’ The Laurel are expected to deliver premier amenities on par with condominiums, whether resort-style pools or golf simulators. Onsite brands sweeten the deal. Equinox leased 35,000 square feet above The Laurel’s ground-level retailers Alo and Crate & Barrel. RH, whose rooftop restaurant draws society page names from Palm Beach, jumpstarted CityPlace’s needle-mover migration in 2017. “It was a huge signal of confidence in the market,” said Bargas, of fresh commitments, from Eataly’s second Florida location launching in a former church to home decor e-tailer Perigold’s foray into brick-and-mortar. “Eataly will be a big anchor that brings pedestrian traffic. We’re setting up this place for the next 20 years.” Walkability, activations and art also drive the success of CityPlace and the overall neighborhood. Related Ross commissioned Fred Eversley’s largest public installation Portals for its One Flagler luxury office tower with an Estiatorio Milos restaurant due. Among CityPlace’s 500 annual events, last month’s holiday lights kickoff drew 5,000 people; New Wave Art Wknd organized public art tours and conversation panels in December, and fitness and wellness festival District Fit returns in March. Space doesn’t sit idle for long. While awaiting construction to begin, vacant lots and high-profile corners host makeshift experiences; current pop-ups include Bal Harbour Shops Access, SoulCycle and CityPickle. Related Ross’s total square footage of 6.6 million square feet breaks down into 3.25 million square feet for offices, 1.9 million square feet for residential and 700,000 square feet each for hotels and retail/restaurants. Asked whether fashion remains a viable component (The Laurel was once home to Macy’s), Bargas said, “Clothing is still important, and we’re about to sign a fashion company that appeals to women in their 20s to 40s.” If CityPlace and the Flagler waterfront mirror New York’s SoHo and uptown environs, the Nora District is West Palm Beach’s answer to New York’s downtown scene. An abbreviation of North Railroad Avenue, the trackside enclave where 19th-century developer Henry Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railroad sped up South Florida’s real estate boom, combines historic warehouses and new buildings throughout 40 acres and 2.5 million square feet. The public-private partnership between the city of West Palm Beach and development firms NDT Development, Place Projects and Wheelock Street Capital created a master plan from 2019 to 2022, with initial phases premiering over the next two years. Infrastructure improvements call for new water and sewer lines, storm drainage and widened sidewalks as well as burying power lines. Miami-based ArquitectonicaGEO has been commissioned for streetscapes, landscaping and outdoor seating; a new, old-fashioned cobblestone street creates a sense of place, and green spaces feature pockets parks and a sculpture garden combined with a play area. Joe Furst, founder and managing principal for Place Projects in Miami, said compelling infrastructure, like installing an underground grease trap system, attracted hospitality businesses. “We’re taking that cost away from restaurateurs. All [retail] buildings can be used for food and beverage, which is why those leases did well in advance,” he said, of confirmed tenants such as New York’s Pastis, Juliana’s Pizza, Van Leeuwen Ice Cream and H&H Bagels; Boston’s Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Naples, Fla.’s Del Mar Mediterranean; Madison, N.J.’s Sunday Motor Co., and locally born Celis Juice Bar & Café. In getting ahead of growth, Furst implements lessons learned from developing Miami’s Wynwood District as Goldman Properties’ managing director for a decade. He said their early-stage strategies are nothing alike. “We aren’t just slapping paint on buildings like Wynwood but delivering Class-A retail from the start for sophisticated operators with more than one concept,” said Furst, who also eschewed Wynwood’s signature graffitied façades for different art mediums like artist Carolyn Salas’ aluminum wall sculpture. “Rather than giving away space to get people to come in and having tenant turnover and displacement as rents increase, tenants are signing 10- to -20-year leases here.” Anchored by the 201-room Nora Hotel from New York hoteliers Richard Born, Ira Drukier and Sean MacPherson with nods to Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner, the lifestyle mix features IGK salon, Solidcore Pilates, Sana Skin Studio, The Spot Barbershop, Long Island-based womenswear specialty chain Mint, and ZenHippo’s first flagship for its family programs in Palm Beach County. Apartments, condominiums and office buildings will also add density. Bargas feels West Palm Beach’s retail options, including downtown’s Clematis Street, complement each other and are necessary for the city to evolve to the next level. “Businesses aren’t coming to these different areas because they can get a deal. It’s more about where is my brand best reflected and where will it have the most success.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Why Is APi Group Corp. (APG) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. Our Methodology For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers surveying a construction site in preparation for a new underground infrastructure. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $848.9 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) is a leading safety services provider specializing in end-to-end integrated occupancy systems, including fire protection, HVAC, and entry systems. Its offerings span design, installation, inspection, and maintenance services, catering to customers across the energy, industrial, and commercial sectors. On November 24, Baird raised its price target for APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) stock from $39 to $40, maintaining an Outperform rating. This revision followed analysts’ site visits and assessments of APG’s recent acquisition and its implications for growth. During these visits, Baird analysts engaged with APG field management and customers, marking the first investor-focused visit to Elevated, the company’s newly acquired elevator maintenance division. Baird highlighted that this acquisition significantly broadens APG’s service portfolio and establishes a promising platform for future mergers and acquisitions. APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) also reported solid growth during its Q3 2024 earnings call. Revenue increased by 2.4% year-over-year to $1.83 billion, driven by organic growth within the Safety Services segment. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.4%, with the company reaffirming its commitment to achieving a 13% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025. Despite project delays impacting revenues by approximately $150 million, APG remains optimistic about sustained growth and margin improvement. The company also reported an adjusted gross margin rise to 31% and a 9% year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS, reaching $0.51. Overall APG ranks 10th on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of APG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks. Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Monday, December 9th, dragged down by a decline in Nvidia. The plunge pressured the broader technology sector, with investors also turning their attention to an important inflation report due this week. READ NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Investors expect the consumer price index (CPI) data set to be released on Wednesday, while the producer price index (PPI) is anticipated on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18. The plunge, however, seems only temporary, and technology stocks are poised to gain in the future. BlackRock anticipates that infrastructure and cybersecurity investments will "shine" in 2025. Jay Jacobs, the firm’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, considers the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. Jacobs said that AI companies need to build out their data centers and that keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the New Year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable. We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” Jacobs further stated that even though technology may seem tangible, it is also heavily reliant on physical infrastructure such as energy, materials like copper, and even real estate. These real-world components are essential for supporting the systems that are used every day. He further went on to say that it’s not just the mega-cap tech names that are winning, other semiconductor companies and other data center companies are benefiting from the rise of this theme. In this regard, AI ETFs can play a significant role in helping investors gain targeted exposure while mitigating some of the risks associated with investing in individual AI stocks. They are a smart way for investors to invest in a theme for seeking longer-term gains. “Identifying future winners can be very difficult – it’s not always the obvious names that make it in the long-term”.

The growth includes double-digit increases in public cloud services and notable triple-digit growth in AI-related product revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter, as per the latest September quarter earnings. Collaborations with companies such as Japan's Lightblue, Malaysia's Pictureworks, Singapore's Atlas, and China’s Drunk Elephant demonstrate the diverse applications of Alibaba Cloud’s technologies. "We are thrilled to witness our robust cloud infrastructure and AI offerings empowering organizations across a diverse range of industries to further drive transformation in 2024 with our partners together. As the leading cloud service provider in Asia, we remain committed to helping our customers enhance their operations and deepen their connections with consumers, while collaborating with our ecosystem partners to unlock the full potential of AI and cloud technologies for businesses of all sizes”.

Title: How is it we know more about Luigi Mangione than we do about Thomas Crooks?

Full Content:
Within hours of his apprehension in Pennsylvania in connection with the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, scads of information rolled out about the life and times of suspect Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man who has been accused of the killing, and in a very short period of time, the Internet being a fast medium. We've seen pictures of his family, and heard their statements of shock and regret at the news. We learned he grew up wealthy, the son of the owner of two resorts near Baltimore. We learned he once worked in a nursing home owned by his family. We learned where he went to school, even high school where he was a valedictorian, and that he was quite accomplished in the difficult subjects of computer science and engineering at an Ivy League university. We've heard from his friends, who say he was normal and outgoing, with some even seeing leadership qualities in him. We learned he was athletic and outdoorsy, enjoying hiking and surfing. We learned he was well traveled, living as a digital nomad in Hawaii, traveling to Japan, living in San Francisco, as well as Pennsylvania and Maryland in his life earlier. We learned about his online presence through his many social media accounts, posting pictures of his ripped physique, liking the Unabomber, disliking Jordan Peterson, getting into deep philosophical discussions with others. We learned about his surfing accident which led to back surgery, leaving him with four pins in his back, apparent pictures of which he posted on his social media bannerheads. We even learned that, according to a friend, that the surgery made it too painful for him to have sexual relations ever again, which he resented. We learned of his obsessive dislike for the health insurance industry -- and can only recall that involuntary eunuchs have been known to take revenge on their tormentors. We learned about his manifesto which was picked up by the cops when they apprehended him, and it seems to have been leaked already into the Internet, railing against the health care industry. So there's quite a lot of information out there, and this synopsis is far from complete. That, in addition to the details of the murder and the details of the apprehension, presents a pretty comprehensive picture. It's in striking contrast to the last high-profile killer who came to our attention last July, Thomas Crooks, another young man with a similar background who got his name in the news for attempting to kill President Trump amid a sea of Secret Service incompetence, but did manage to murder an innocent firefighter who was nearby, and injure two others in addition to President Trump, before he was shot dead by a cop. His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack. We know nothing about the strange ad he made for Blackrock, or the 18 burner phones in his backpack. We don't know who he was talking to on the phone, seen in a video, before he launched into his assassination bid. If he had a manifesto, we haven't seen it. And his social media accounts were quickly scrubbed and shut down. Now, some of this can be explained away by Mangione having an internet presence and being a non-misfit socially, which made more information available generally. But that doesn't explain all of it. Where are the classmates who knew him? Why is his family so silent? Why has his social media presence been suppressed? And why is the Secret Service seemingly going out of its way to obstruct Congress? There have been quite a few shouting matches at this point. Even less information is available about a second apparent wannabe-assassin of Trump in Florida a few weeks later, accused gunman Ryan Routh.We know he was a loser of some kind, having no money and living in a shambling house in Hawaii (as Mangione did). We don't know how he got a lot of money to travel around trailing Trump from North Carolina to Florida. There is some information about his inchoate political views, which like everything else about him, is fragmented. The guess one can make for this assymetrical distribution of information is that the press and the government investigating the assassination attempts hates Trump, and may even be implicated in the assasination attempts, as if in a coverup. By contrast, most people are pretty appalled about the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York. That may explain why so little information about the attempts on Trump are out there in contrast to Mangione. They'd rather sweep it under the rug. It's hard to say with certainly what this is about, but it's just strange that some information gets out more readily about major events than others. Funny how it's the information we want most.

Title: Is The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) the Best American Dividend Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best American Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other American dividend stocks. The US economy expanded by 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, as reported in the Advance GDP release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the ninth straight quarter of growth in real GDP. While the third-quarter increase was robust, it slightly lagged behind the 3% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated a 3.1% rise. Regardless of market conditions, investors frequently seek to minimize risk in their portfolios, and investing in dividend stocks is a reliable approach to achieve this. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the growing significance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over time, dividend income has steadily risen, increasing from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, interest income has seen a decline, dropping from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by over 10% since the start of 2024, underperforming the market. Although dividend stocks may not have been hitting it out of the park this year, US companies have remained dedicated to rewarding shareholders by consistently paying dividends. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones, for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, US common dividend increases totaled $74.7 billion, marking a 16.9% rise from the $63.9 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier, ending in September 2023. The report also mentioned that in the third quarter of 2024, there were 480 dividend increases reported, marking a 7.1% rise compared to the 448 increases in the same period in 2023. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $14.1 billion for the quarter. WisdomTree offers an interesting perspective on global dividends in its report. According to their findings, the global equity market currently distributes around $1.6 trillion in dividends, an increase from approximately $1.5 trillion last year. Notably, 55% of these dividends come from outside the US, which is about 15% more than the non-US share in market cap-weighted indexes. On the other hand, US companies account for 44% of global dividends, which is considerably less than their 63% share of global market capitalization. This suggests that non-US markets are more heavily weighted in dividend-focused indexes, while US exposure is relatively lower. For instance, European countries make up about a quarter of global dividend payments, which is 10% more than their share of the global market cap. That said, the start of dividend payments by several major US tech companies contributed an additional 1.1 percentage points to the global growth rate in Q2, as reported by Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index report. The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement retail company that sells appliances, tools, construction equipment, and related products. The company faced challenges this year due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened overall consumer demand and led to reduced spending on home improvement projects. In its latest quarter, it reported a 1.3% decline in same-store sales compared to the previous year—an unfavorable outcome for any retail-focused business. Management anticipates this downward trend will persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. That said, the stock has surged by over 22.4% since the start of 2024. This was also highlighted by Carillon Tower Advisers in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “While Home Depot, Inc.’s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company’s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.” In the third quarter of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported revenue of $40.22 billion, which showed a 6.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating income came in at $5.4 billion and its operating margin was 13.5%. It experienced improved customer interest in seasonal products and various outdoor projects, along with additional sales driven by demand related to hurricane activity. In the first nine months of the year, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) generated over $15 billion in operating cash flow. The company's strong cash position makes it a generous dividend payer. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.13%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 14 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 82 hedge funds owned stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $7.6 billion in total. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company. Overall HD ranks 3rd on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best American Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other American dividend stocks. The US economy expanded by 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, as reported in the Advance GDP release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the ninth straight quarter of growth in real GDP. While the third-quarter increase was robust, it slightly lagged behind the 3% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated a 3.1% rise. Regardless of market conditions, investors frequently seek to minimize risk in their portfolios, and investing in dividend stocks is a reliable approach to achieve this. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the growing significance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over time, dividend income has steadily risen, increasing from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, interest income has seen a decline, dropping from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by over 10% since the start of 2024, underperforming the market. Although dividend stocks may not have been hitting it out of the park this year, US companies have remained dedicated to rewarding shareholders by consistently paying dividends. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones, for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, US common dividend increases totaled $74.7 billion, marking a 16.9% rise from the $63.9 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier, ending in September 2023. The report also mentioned that in the third quarter of 2024, there were 480 dividend increases reported, marking a 7.1% rise compared to the 448 increases in the same period in 2023. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $14.1 billion for the quarter. WisdomTree offers an interesting perspective on global dividends in its report. According to their findings, the global equity market currently distributes around $1.6 trillion in dividends, an increase from approximately $1.5 trillion last year. Notably, 55% of these dividends come from outside the US, which is about 15% more than the non-US share in market cap-weighted indexes. On the other hand, US companies account for 44% of global dividends, which is considerably less than their 63% share of global market capitalization. This suggests that non-US markets are more heavily weighted in dividend-focused indexes, while US exposure is relatively lower. For instance, European countries make up about a quarter of global dividend payments, which is 10% more than their share of the global market cap. That said, the start of dividend payments by several major US tech companies contributed an additional 1.1 percentage points to the global growth rate in Q2, as reported by Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index report. The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotech company. Its recent success, driven by its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment pill, has left some investors viewing it as a stock past its prime. With demand for the vaccine declining sharply, concerns have emerged about possible shifts in vaccine policy under the incoming Trump administration, adding to investor apprehensions. Since the start of 2024, the stock has fallen by over 13%. That said, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported strong earnings in the most recent quarter. The company posted revenue of $17.7 billion, which showed a significant 32% growth from the same period last year. It sustained remarkable growth in its Oncology portfolio, with significant revenue contributions from products such as Padcev, Xtandi, Lorbrena, and Braftovi/Mektovi. Additionally, it successfully met increased demand for Paxlovid during the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. In the first nine months of 2024, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) returned $7.1 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company's quarterly dividend comes in at $0.42 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 6.51%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 14 consecutive years. Parnassus Investments highlighted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “During the quarter, we added new positions in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NICE and Charter Communications. We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer’s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us. The company completed its acquisition of Seagen, which should strengthen Pfizer’s pipeline in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Pfizer also offers an attractive dividend yield.” As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 80 hedge funds held stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared with 84 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes is more than $3 billion. Among these hedge funds, Two Sigma Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall PFE ranks 4th on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The stock is down by over 11% since the start of 2024. The company's performance has been lackluster, as investors have found little motivation to invest in it this year.

In the third quarter of 2024, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $32.07 billion, which grew by 7% from the same period last year. The company's performance highlighted its strength, with broadband ARPU rising by 3.6%. Its connectivity business also grew by 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for Connectivity & Platforms reached 40.9%.

Title: Why Is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Among the Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks. In the face of economic uncertainty, consumer preferences in the beauty industry are changing. A Bloomberg Intelligence poll conducted in June 2024 with 650 participants found that 40% of respondents gave beauty and personal care purchases more importance than other products. Nonetheless, this represents the lowest result since the survey's launch two years ago, a 10-percentage-point drop from January. Despite the continued success of premium cosmetic products, there is less demand for mainstream, reasonably priced products, which make up the majority of the market. Leonard Lauder's "Lipstick Index" theory, which associates economic slowdowns with increased spending on self-care, seems less sound these days. Although the beauty industry has grown significantly over the last five years, Andrea Felsted, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, observes that customer interests are beginning to shift. This drop in affordable beauty purchases raises questions about how well the industry can withstand economic downturns. The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: “While we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.” Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like "buy-now, pay-later" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions. In this article, we first used a stock screener, to list down all Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks (as of the writing of this article) with the highest institutional ownership. From the resultant dataset, we chose 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81 The multinational healthcare firm Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), through its subsidiary MENTOR, specializes in breast reconstruction and aesthetics. For use in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery treatments, the company offers breast implants, tissue expanders, and other surgical materials. Mentor's Breast Implant Simulator app allows users to submit images or use real-time video to model implant sizes. It uses augmented reality to display breast augmentation outcomes. It also provides educational content, connects users to nearby surgeons, and makes it easier to share discoveries for feedback. Revenue increased by 5.25% YoY to $22.47 billion in the third quarter of 2024, with Innovative Medicine leading the way with a 4.9% YoY growth to $14.58 billion. Moreover, the MedTech division, which encompasses aesthetics, reported a 6.4% increase in operational sales in the third quarter of 2024. Acquisitions such as Abiomed had a favorable effect on this division. The firm produced $14 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of this year, compared to $11.9 billion in the same period last year. For the past 62 years, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has consistently increased its dividends. The current quarterly dividend paid by the firm is $1.62 per share. An analyst at Wolfe Research named Alexandria Hammond began covering Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a $190 price target and an Outperform rating. Beyond Mounjaro/Zepbound from Lilly (LLY), the firm anticipates growth names and/or "dream the dream" names to win in 2025. J&J's Pharma growth drivers, including JNJ-2113, Tremfya, nipocalimab, Carvykti, and Drazalex Faspro, are viewed as "best-in-class" by the firm. Moreover, Wolfe predicts that J&J's revenue would increase by at least 3% despite Stelara's loss of exclusivity challenges. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns 7,560,199 shares worth $1.23 billion as of Q3. Overall JNJ ranks 1st on our list of the best cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: “While we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.” Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like "buy-now, pay-later" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions.

Title: Bitcoin LTHs cash out at 326% gains: Can new demand keep BTC stable?

Time Published: 2024-12-11T04:00:34Z
Full Content:
Long-term Bitcoin holders are cashing out amid a rally, while new investors help absorb supply. As Bitcoin’s [BTC] price continues its impressive rally, long-term holders are seizing the opportunity to cash out, realizing gains of approximately 326% on their investments with an average entry price of $23.4K. This surge in profit-taking has added selling pressure to the market, yet BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience, absorbing the increased supply. But what’s driving these LTHs to sell now? And how are new investors stepping in to sustain the market’s upward momentum? Long-term BTC holders are capitalizing on the current rally, realizing an average 326% profit with an entry cost of $23.4K. This behavior aligns with historical patterns where significant price surges often trigger profit-taking. However, this wave of selling appears more strategic than reactive. With BTC trading well above the LTH cost basis, many are opting to de-risk amidst macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential interest rate shifts and market liquidity concerns. Source: X Additionally, the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s halving events may play a role, with some LTHs anticipating a plateau or temporary downturn. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin’s resilience – buoyed by strong demand from newer market entrants – shows a robust redistribution phase rather than an alarming sell-off. This shift in market dynamics could redefine BTC’s near-term trajectory. The recent surge in BTC’s price reflects a shift where demand, rather than just supply constraints, is driving its growth. New investors, particularly those leveraging institutional-grade financial instruments like Bitcoin ETFs, have played a pivotal role in absorbing the available supply. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock amassed $10 billion in assets under management within seven weeks, accounting for over 40% of spot ETF volumes. This rapid adoption has spurred projections that Bitcoin ETFs might surpass gold ETFs in total assets in the near future. With ETFs now channeling 75% of new Bitcoin investments, their influence could grow even further, especially as the halving event heightened scarcity. Anticipation of reduced supply coupled with increasing demand positions new investors as key drivers of Bitcoin’s price momentum​. As Bitcoin navigates heightened selling pressure from long-term holders, the road ahead appears shaped by crucial developments. The halving event has tightened BTC supply, boosting scarcity premiums. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Institutional interest, especially through spot Bitcoin ETFs, may stabilize demand and promote adoption. However, regulatory clarity remains crucial for BTC’s mainstream recognition. Bitcoin’s growing link to macroeconomic trends and traditional assets positions it as both speculative and maturing. Its ability to sustain growth or navigate volatility depends on balancing innovation, adoption, and the ongoing tension between scarcity and liquidity.

Report by KS Badri Narayanan of businessline | Read here Leader with strong moats in a growing industry - Emkay Global Research Vishal Mega Mart (VMML) caters to a large and fast-growing TAM (USD430bn; ~10% CAGR), by affordably addressing aspirations of the middle-/lower-income India. Variety and Affordability are key moats, as VMML is a one-stop-shop for Apparel/FMCG/General Merchandise categories, and offers the best affordability with high share of own brands (~72%). VMML aspires to continue delivering strong double-digit growth, mainly helped by low-teen SSG trends and partly via store additions. VMML expects to see retail space CAGR of ~10%, as it currently caters to ~400 cities vs a huge potential of ~1,300 cities (with population above 50K). VMML also has potential to go deeper in existing cities. High store-throughput and lower WC needs ensure best-in-class payback (18-20 months) and generate sufficient cash-flows for pursuing growth. IPO of Rs80bn is entirely OFS, with post-IPO market cap of Rs352bn. Key risks: Supply overhang on big PE ownership and potential ESOP dilution (4-5%).

Title: Is AppLovin Corporation (APP) Among the Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applovin-corporation-app-among-best-024932001.html
Time Published: 2024-12-11T02:49:32Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks. For a large portion of investors who put money in the market, growth is the primary objective. The stocks that these investors prefer are also stocks that are either currently exhibiting strong revenue growth or have product strengths or other competitive advantages that can ensure that they will dominate their markets and grow in the future. Broadly speaking, it is possible to identify such stocks by looking at which industries are expected to grow strongly. A few years ago, semiconductor design and fabrication was one such sector. Back then, the world's largest integrated chip manufacturer known for its Core processor lineup had started to struggle. The nature of the semiconductor industry which requires years of research expertise and billions of dollars in capital expenditure meant that the market was not only open to new players but also that this opening favored incumbents that already had the necessary investments and expertise in place. This gap led to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the firm which ranked 3rd on our list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket to touch astronomically high levels as soon as the firm started to turn a profit. As an illustration, consider the P/E ratio of this stock at Q1 2018's close. The ratio back then was 111, while the integrated chip manufacturer was trading at 19 and the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer which ranks 2nd on our list of 10 Best Tech Stocks For Long-Term Investment traded at 16.11. During the same period, Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock whose shares have gained 700%+ since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT was trading at a P/E ratio of 37. Naturally, this indicated that investors were betting heavily on the firm to grow. Since 2018's first quarter, its shares have gained a whopping 1,204% while the GPU company has gained 2,175% and the integrated chip manufacturer is down by 57.6%. Between its fiscal years 2017 to the latest trailing-twelve-month revenue, the growth stock that traded at a P/E ratio of 111 in 2018 has grown revenue by 358%, so it's safe to say that in this case, growth investors were right, and their investments if dearly held since then have outpaced the firm's revenue in growth terms. Therein lies the magic of growth stocks, which can generate substantial returns for investors. However, as is the case with all things in life, this promise also comes with a dark side. Research from the University of Michigan shows that growth stocks are punished harder than value stocks in case of negative earnings surprises. For their research, the researchers analyzed consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly share prices, stock prices, P/E ratios, and other variables for 13 years to determine the returns of growth and value stocks that missed or beat analyst earnings estimates. By bifurcating their results across five categories starting from Low Growth and ending at High Growth, they demonstrate a clear difference between the post-earnings stock returns of growth and non-growth stocks. For the Low Growth stocks, a negative earnings surprise led to -3.57% in share price returns starting two days following the report and ending before the next report. The High Growth stocks led the Low Growth stocks by 3.75 percentage points in negative returns as they lost 7.32% over the same period after posting a negative earnings surprise. The 3.75 percentage point differential is key when we analyze these two categories' stock price performance after positive earnings surprises. This is because while the Low Growth stocks gained 5.44% after the earnings surprise, the High Growth stocks led them by only 0.88 percentage points by gaining 6.32%. Similarly, not only are growth stocks punished harder if they miss investor expectations, but the share price drops can make earlier optimism regarding their fortunes appear misplaced as well. The best example of this fact is the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. SaaS firms were the pinnacle of growth investing because of their business model which allows them to earn recurring revenue through sizable contracts while keeping costs low. Investor optimism surrounding SaaS stock touched a feverish pitch in Q1 2021 when their median EV/Revenue multiple sat at 14.1x. This meant that the firms' market capitalization and debt minus cash and other assets were valued 14 times their sales. But, by Q4 2022 this had dropped to 4.6x as a combination of factors such as higher rates leading to tighter business spending and the pivot towards artificial intelligence soured sentiment. SaaS firms were particularly hurt since AI enables businesses to self-develop software which reduces the need for SaaS products and services. So, with the landscape surrounding growth stocks being as dynamic as their share prices, we decided to look at some aggressive growth stocks with high revenue growth and significant hedge fund interest. Our Methodology To compile our list of the best aggressive growth stocks, we first sifted out 12 stocks with annual latest quarter revenue growth greater than 35% from multiple growth ETFs. The stocks were then ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a mobile device, showing an advertiser reaching out to a consumer via a software-based platform. Revenue Growth: 38.6% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 51 AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company that works with video game companies to enable them to run advertisements, analytics, and other associated operations. It is one of the best-performing stocks of 2024 as the shares are up an unbelievable 935% year-to-date. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is also a diversified company as it owns and runs more than 200 video games in a market where the internet and digital entertainment mediums reign supreme. The firm benefited from a blowout third-quarter earnings report in November which sent its shares surging by a stunning 33% in aftermarket trading. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP)'s $1.2 billion in revenue marked a 38.6% annual growth and beat analyst estimates of $1.12 billion. Its median guidance of $1.25 billion for fourth-quarter revenue also beat analyst estimates of $1.17 billion by a comfortable $800 million. Looking ahead, AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) could benefit from expanding into tertiary markets such as connected televisions to add more juice to its stock. SaltLight Capital mentioned AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “This quarter, our notable contributors included AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP). We start with the current state of the “hit” title-driven market. These dynamics are not new, so many studios have transitioned to free-to-play games (FTP). We then talk about AppLovin, which is at the nexus of making this traditional market successful. Overall APP ranks 4th on our list of the aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Federal, State Judges Block Kroger-Albertsons $25 Billion Merger

Two separate rulings on Tuesday stopped the merger of supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons in its tracks. The decisions by U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson and Judge Marshall Ferguson echo widespread concerns about potential negative impacts on competition and consumer choice, affecting millions across the country. Judge Nelson, presiding in Portland, Ore., issued a preliminary injunction after a detailed three-week hearing. Nelson pointed out the likelihood that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is challenging the merger, would succeed in proving that the $24.6 billion deal would substantially lessen competition in the market. The preliminary injunction seeks to preserve the status quo until an in-house administrative judge at the FTC can further assess the merger’s implications. Hours later, in Seattle, Judge Ferguson issued a permanent injunction, specifically prohibiting the merger within the state, citing it as a clear threat to maintaining competitive market conditions. His decision reflects a concerted effort to protect consumers and workers in Washington state from the potential consolidation harms that could arise from such a colossal merger. WESTCHESTER, CA – JULY 10, 2024 – A shopper makes his way down an aisle at Vons market in Westchester which has been serving the community since 1952. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) “We’re standing up to mega-monopolies to keep prices down,” Ferguson said. “We went to court to block this illegal merger to protect Washingtonians’ struggling with high grocery prices and the workers whose jobs were at stake. This is an important victory for affordability, worker protections and the rule of law.” The merger, first announced in 2022, has faced scrutiny from federal and state regulators. The FTC’s lawsuit, supported by attorneys general from nine states and the District of Columbia, argued that merging Kroger and Albertsons would not only reduce consumer choice but also drive up prices and dampen wage competition in the grocery sector. In response to the court’s decisions, representatives from Kroger and Albertsons expressed their disappointment and are currently considering their next steps, which could include appealing the rulings, NBC News reported. (RELATED: More Americans Turning To Discount Grocer As Prices Skyrocket) “We believe we clearly outlined during the proceedings how the proposed merger would expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs, and enhance customers’ shopping experience. We are carefully reviewing the Court’s opinion and are evaluating our options in accordance with the merger agreement,” Albertsons said in a statement. Both companies have defended the merger as a strategic move to better compete with retail giants such as Walmart, Costco, and Amazon, The Associated Press reported. Albertsons even said that blocking the merger could lead to dire consequences, including layoffs, store closures and an exit from several markets. Under the merger agreement, Kroger and Albertsons planned to divest 579 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers to alleviate overlapping market concerns, AP said. The Biden administration initiated a legal challenge in Feb. 2024 against the Kroger Company and Albertsons Companies, Inc. merger, arguing that the $24.6 billion deal stifles competition. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years,” Henry Liu, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the release.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He Likes Adobe Inc. (ADBE) ‘Very Much’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the rise of Bitcoin and expressed his admiration for the digital currency’s growth. However, he was careful to emphasize that Bitcoin should not replace traditional investments, particularly stocks, but rather should complement them in a diversified portfolio. “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really I do, not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not bury it.” Cramer recalled the moment when President-elect Donald Trump began giving importance to cryptocurrency during his administration. On July 27, Trump declared that the U.S. government would fully embrace Bitcoin if he won the election. At the time, Bitcoin was valued just under $70,000. Cramer also noted Trump’s promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and make America the global leader in cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted Trump’s statement, “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Regardless of whether one agrees with the policy, Cramer remarked, Trump’s words were a clear signal of how beneficial the growing popularity of cryptocurrency could be for its owners. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan This Week: 10 Stocks to Watch Cramer then shared insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold. He went on to say: “I've always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world's lunacy. But for years now, I've also been saying Bitcoin's a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don't want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer also acknowledged that some people might have gone all-in on Bitcoin and praised their decision. However, he recommended balancing Bitcoin investments with stocks. For instance, if Trump were to make a move to encourage buying Tesla, Cramer commented, having both stocks and crypto would give investors an edge. “While we could become the bitcoin network, especially since President-elect Trump christened us as the bitcoin nation, I actually think there’s more to investing than just owning cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin's part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history. Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 29 stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired over the last 2 weeks. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of December 9. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Average Price Target Upside: 13.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Cramer commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) before it reports its Q4 and FY2024 earnings on December 11, saying: “As I mentioned earlier, the enterprise software stocks have been roaring, reacting very positively to pretty much everything these days. So maybe we should start thinking about buying the stock of Adobe, which has some of the very best software to help businesses with marketing and web design. I like this company very much, but it's been stuck in enterprise software purgatory. Not anymore. Maybe it has a real run by just delivering good numbers.” Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a prominent software company known for offering a wide range of products and services, particularly in digital media creation and document management. Recently, the company has made significant strides in integrating AI into its products. During its third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted how the integration of AI, particularly in generative features, into its core products has led to higher customer retention, as users tend to stick with the tools that incorporate these advanced capabilities. The company projects its total revenue for the fourth quarter to fall between $5.50 billion and $5.55 billion. It expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.63 to $4.68. Furthermore, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) expects to see a net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) of approximately $550 million from its Digital Media segment. This segment's revenue is forecasted to be between $4.09 billion and $4.12 billion. In addition, the company expects its Digital Experience segment to generate revenue between $1.36 billion and $1.38 billion, with subscription revenue from this segment ranging from $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. Overall ADBE ranks 6th on our list of the best Jim Cramer stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADBE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Virtualizing GCP data by using Fabric Shortcuts: Data Engineering with Fabric
URL: https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/virtualizing-gcp-data-by-using-fabric-shortcuts-data-engineering-with-fabric
Time Published: 2024-12-11T00:00:11Z
Full Content:
John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An assembly line in a semiconductor factory, with workers at their stations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor firm with a significant focus on data centers. The company was awarded a “Buy” rating on December 4 by DBS analyst Fang Boon Foo, having reiterated its bullish stance on the stock. Marvell Technology has been thriving in the data center market, with revenues surpassing expectations that are driven by a strong demand for its AI technologies. The company makes custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google, Amazon and Microsoft. The company’s leadership in communications and connectivity, reinforced by key growth areas such as data infrastructure, cloud, and 5G, underpins its market advantage. Moreover, its shift from consumer products achieved through strategic acquisitions like Innovium, Inphi, and Aquantia, demonstrates its commitment towards stable enterprise solutions. Lastly, expected growth in return on equity and a recovery in non-AI segments support a positive outlook despite past challenges. Overall, MRVL ranks 5th on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRVL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock sees investor shift from cash after even 'modest' rate cuts
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/blackrock-sees-investor-shift-from-cash-after-even-modest-rate-cuts-3765150

By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are expected to increase their allocations to stocks and bonds from cash after even "modest" Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief financial officer said on Tuesday. Expectations earlier this year that the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates aggressively after hiking them to fight inflation have moderated in recent months as the U.S. economy continues to show momentum despite high borrowing costs. "I think even modest rate cuts are going to fuel a very healthy amount of investor re-risking," said BlackRock CFO Martin Small, speaking at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services conference on Tuesday. Lower interest rates are expected to eventually pull yields in money markets down from well above 4%, which is where cash-like instruments like T-bills currently stand. So far, however, there has been little evidence that investors are abandoning cash. Assets in U.S. money markets stood at $6.77 trillion as of last week, data from the Investment Company Institute showed, up from $6.3 trillion in early September. "There's still enough political and economic uncertainty in the world that cash is an attractive safe haven for clients," Small said. "Market expectations for rate cuts ... are shallower and fewer," he said, adding that these and other factors had made money market fund balances stickier. The U.S. central bank started cutting interest rates in September by 50 basis points. That was followed by another 25 basis point cut last month, with investors now betting on an additional quarter of a percentage point cut later this month. After that, further easing is largely expected to depend on economic data as well as the path of inflation. Investors now expect interest rates of about 3.7% by the end of next year, which would be about 90 basis points higher than what was priced in September. Still, Small said investors that favor cash were underperforming traditional investment portfolios that blended equities and bonds. "That fear of missing out ... is contributing meaningfully to re-risking," he said. BlackRock's fixed-income products such as bond exchange-traded funds had seen strong inflows this year, he added. "It's not the floodgates ... but we've definitely seen more normalized allocations legging into fixed income," he said.

He Lifeng is one of China's four vice premiers, and heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party's economic and finance committee. He met with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink in Beijing on Dec. 5, and Goldman Sachs President and COO John E. Waldron on Dec. 4, according to state media. That followed a meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser on Nov. 21, state media said. "The Chinese are seeking all possible avenues to access those now ascending to power in Washington. The Trump Team," said Peter Alexander, founder of Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. "Back channeling is how China operates, even prefers, when building lines of communications." Goldman Sachs said it was aware of the reports. The two other financial firms did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. Trump has filled his Cabinet picks with at least 10 reported billionaires, including two with a finance-heavy background: hedge fund manager Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for Commerce secretary. "I do think the Wall Street folks that are coming into commerce and treasury will serve a moderating role on the trade protectionist side," said Clark Packard, research fellow at the Cato Institute. "It's all relative because I do think there's going to be something protectionist on the trade side. Those voices will be the voices that work to mitigate some of that." "Especially at Treasury they're pretty worried about market reaction," Packard said. "The one thing that can truly maybe scare Trump away from a really aggressive [policy] would be the market reaction." U.S. stocks are on track for a relatively rare second straight year of more than 20% gains. After tumbling early this year, Chinese stocks rebounded after Beijing signaled a shift toward stimulus in late September. Chinese authorities on Monday affirmed that supportive stance in a high-level meeting. With actions such as hosting Wall Street executives and imposing export controls on critical minerals, Beijing is keeping its options open, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, who is Maurice R. Greenberg senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "They are preparing for the worst-case scenario." But she cautioned that it's unlikely that financial institutions can do much to mitigate tariffs and tensions with the U.S. "Business transactions and Wall Street executives, one way or another, they would not give up opportunities in any market as long as it fits into their profile," Liu said. Chinese financial media summarized He Lifeng's meetings with the U.S. executives as sending a signal on Beijing's willingness to open up the financial sector and attract long-term, foreign institutional investment. Foreign capital inflows are often cast by Chinese state media as a symbol of support for the domestic market. The Chinese vice premier also met with Invesco President and CEO Andrew Schlossberg in Beijing on Nov. 12, and HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker on Nov. 14, according to state media. HSBC said it had nothing to add to the report. Invesco did not respond to a request for comment. U.S.-China capital markets have been "arguably the most dynamic and inter-connected aspect" of the bilateral relationship in the last two decades, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. "When the cross-border finance relationship is constructive and cooperative, it could lead to MAP, i.e. mutual assured [prosperity]; otherwise it will be MAD, mutual assured destruction," Ma said, referring to a Cold War deterrence principle.

Title: Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares continued to slide on Tuesday, falling more than 3% after a Chinese regulator announced that it was investigating the chipmaker for possible violations of the country’s antimonopoly law. On Monday, December 9, the Chinese government announced that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had initiated an investigation concerning Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 required approval from Chinese antitrust regulators given their substantial operations in China. The country’s competition authority approved the $7 billion acquisition on the condition that competitors be informed of any new Mellanox products within 90 days of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) gaining access to them. The current investigation aims to highlight whether Nvidia complied with this requirement or failed to do so. South China Morning Post reveals that (AI) chip giant Nvidia could face a fine of up to US$1 billion under Beijing’s antitrust probe. The move, considered retaliation against Washington’s chip restrictions, marks the first time that China’s market regulator has opened the books on a closed deal. As per China’s antitrust law, companies violating antitrust regulations could face fines ranging from 1 to 10 percent of their annual sales from the previous year. However, it does not specify whether this applies to global or China sales. China, including Hong Kong, is Nvidia’s third-largest market by revenue, with sales reaching US$10.3 billion for the financial year ended January 24 (nearly 17 percent of its total revenue). However, it is too early to determine the exact amount of the fine Nvidia could be facing. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honour our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”- Nvidia said in a statement issued in response to the probe. The leading AI chipmaker slid despite a key sales boost from supplier TSMC. While TSMC's strong sales highlight robust demand for Nvidia's GPUs and AI chips, investor sentiment was likely overshadowed by the ongoing antitrust probe. Nvidia’s continued slide today may also have been due to traders opting to sell an “earlier pop”. Historically, December hasn’t been kind to Nvidia either. According to Benzinga, the semiconductor giant often comes into a temporary bearish phase following its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's performance through November is typically strong, creating a favorable environment for year-end profit-taking. This move to secure profits before year-end creates a downward pressure. Nevertheless, December declines like these are likely to be temporary, with the stock likely to rebound in the first quarter, as it has done so previously. Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on Coterra Energy Inc. (CTRA): ‘Shrewdest Operators In The Industry’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-coterra-energy-inc-222710393.html
Time Published: 2024-12-10T22:27:10Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the rise of Bitcoin and expressed his admiration for the digital currency’s growth. However, he was careful to emphasize that Bitcoin should not replace traditional investments, particularly stocks, but rather should complement them in a diversified portfolio. “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really I do, not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not bury it.” Cramer recalled the moment when President-elect Donald Trump began giving importance to cryptocurrency during his administration. On July 27, Trump declared that the U.S. government would fully embrace Bitcoin if he won the election. At the time, Bitcoin was valued just under $70,000. Cramer also noted Trump’s promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and make America the global leader in cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted Trump’s statement, “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Regardless of whether one agrees with the policy, Cramer remarked, Trump’s words were a clear signal of how beneficial the growing popularity of cryptocurrency could be for its owners. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan This Week: 10 Stocks to Watch Cramer then shared insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold. He went on to say: “I've always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world's lunacy. But for years now, I've also been saying Bitcoin's a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don't want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer also acknowledged that some people might have gone all-in on Bitcoin and praised their decision. However, he recommended balancing Bitcoin investments with stocks. For instance, if Trump were to make a move to encourage buying Tesla, Cramer commented, having both stocks and crypto would give investors an edge. “While we could become the bitcoin network, especially since President-elect Trump christened us as the bitcoin nation, I actually think there’s more to investing than just owning cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin's part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history. Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 29 stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired over the last 2 weeks. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of December 9. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig pumping under the open sky of the Permian Basin. Average Price Target Upside: 31.26% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Cramer called Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) the “shrewdest operators in the industry” and said: “I still very much like Coterra Energy, currently the only energy holding in my Charitable Trust… This is another exploration production play, although it’s more balanced between oil and gas. In fact, after a pair of acquisitions announced earlier this month, Coterra’s revenue mix will tip a bit more in favor of oil. Next year, we like to say it’s more oily, less gassy. It does happen to have the lowest cost natural gas of any company in our country and that’s because of the legacy of the old Cabot Oil & Gas which created Coterra when it merged with Cimarex and rebranded the combined company. Coterra (NYSE:CTRA) is an independent oil and gas company involved in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. On December 5, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram raised the stock's price target to $31 from $29 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm anticipates that natural gas producers will benefit from "three key secular demand trends" in 2025: the expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity, growing power demand due to electrification, and the shift from coal to gas. JPMorgan also updated its exploration and production models through 2030, supporting its view of long-term gas prices remaining above $3.50 per MMBtu. The firm believes prices must rise to encourage additional supply growth from the Haynesville and other higher-cost gas basins. Furthermore, JPMorgan expects the oil market to transition from balanced in 2024 to a surplus in 2025 due to increased supply, prompting a shift to a "more defensive stance." In Q3, Coterra (NYSE:CTRA) secured three long-term natural gas sales agreements, starting in 2027-2028, boosting its strategy with exposure to international LNG markets. In November, the company also announced $3.95 billion in acquisitions from Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources, expanding its presence in New Mexico and the Permian Basin. These acquisitions are expected to add 60,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025, with the deals closing in Q1 2025. Overall CTRA ranks 1st on our list of the best Jim Cramer stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CTRA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CTRA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Additionally, I considered market positioning, industry trends and valuation metrics to identify stocks trading at reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Each company was assessed on its ability to navigate current market challenges while maintaining strong operational performance and market leadership in their respective sectors.

Data source: Google Finance Key Metrics: Microsoft continues to dominate the enterprise software market while rapidly expanding its cloud and AI capabilities. The company's Azure cloud platform has grown to command 24% of the global cloud infrastructure market, while its AI integration across products has created new revenue streams. Microsoft stands out as a top pick for January 2025 due to its exceptional financial performance and market dominance. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $62.5 billion, up 18% year over year, with Azure cloud services growing at 28%. Microsoft's AI services generated $3.2 billion in revenue, representing a 165% increase from the previous year. The company's operating margins expanded to 42%, leading to a record free cash flow of $25.7 billion for the quarter. With $145 billion in cash and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.35, Microsoft has ample resources for continued investment in growth initiatives and potential acquisitions. The company's forward P/E of 35x, while not cheap, is justified by its projected earnings growth rate of 15% annually through 2027 and its leadership position in enterprise AI adoption, where spending is expected to reach $150 billion by 2025. Key Metrics: UnitedHealth Group combines the largest private health insurance business in the US with its rapidly growing Optum healthcare services division. The company serves more than 50 million members and continues to innovate in healthcare delivery and cost management. UnitedHealth's appeal lies in its consistent growth and expanding healthcare services ecosystem. The company's Optum division grew revenues by 25% to $56.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2024, with operating margins improving to 8.9%. The insurance segment maintains a stable medical care ratio of 82.1%, indicating effective cost management. UnitedHealth added 2.2 million new members in 2024, bringing its total to 52.5 million, while revenue per consumer increased by 8%. The company's investment in digital health technologies has reduced administrative costs by $2.1 billion annually. Trading at a forward P/E of 32x, below the S&P 500 average, UNH offers value given its projected 13% earnings growth rate and dominant market position in an expanding healthcare sector expected to grow 8% annually through 2028.

Key Metrics: Visa maintains its position as the world's largest payment processor, benefiting from the ongoing shift to digital payments and cross-border transaction growth. The company's network processes over 185 billion transactions annually. Visa's compelling investment case is strengthened by its exceptional financial metrics and growth trajectory. The company processed $3.1 trillion in payment volume in fourth-quarter 2024, up 16% year over year, while cross-border volumes surged 22% as international travel recovered. Operating margins reached an impressive 67%, leading to $4.8 billion in quarterly net income. Visa's return on invested capital of 45% demonstrates its capital efficiency, while its network of 80 million merchant locations provides a strong moat. The company's investments in new payment technologies, including $1.2 billion in blockchain and real-time payment solutions, positions it well for future growth. Trading at a forward P/E of 28.6x, Visa offers reasonable value given its projected 15% annual earnings growth and 54% net income margins. Key Metrics: Costco continues to excel in retail with its membership-based model, offering high-quality products at competitive prices. The company's focus on customer value and operational efficiency has driven consistent growth in both sales and membership. Costco's appeal as a top pick is reinforced by its stellar operational metrics and growth initiatives. The company's membership renewal rate reached a record 93%, while membership fee income grew 8.5% to $4.2 billion annually. same-store sales growth of 5.2% outpaced major retailers, while e-commerce sales surged 15%. Costco's international expansion continues with 28 new warehouses planned for 2025, including 10 in Asia where average store productivity is 15% higher than U.S. locations. The company's private label Kirkland brand reached $65 billion in annual sales, growing 12% year over year and providing higher margins. Despite a seemingly high forward P/E of 59x, Costco's price-to-membership-fee ratio of 17x and consistent double-digit earnings growth justify the premium valuation. Key Metrics: Devon Energy has established itself as a leader in U.S. shale production, with premium assets in the Delaware Basin. The company's variable dividend policy returns significant cash to shareholders while maintaining operational flexibility. Devon Energy's attractiveness stems from its operational efficiency and shareholder-friendly policies. The company's Delaware Basin operations achieved a 45% return on capital at $70 oil prices, while production costs decreased 8% year-over-year. A free cash flow yield of 12% supports the company's variable dividend policy, which returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in 2024. Devon's debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 0.8x is among the lowest in the industry, providing flexibility for opportunistic acquisitions or additional shareholder returns. The company's hedging program locks in profitable prices for 60% of 2025 production, reducing downside risk. Trading at just 12.4x forward earnings with a 5.8% variable dividend yield, Devon offers significant value in an energy sector that remains critical to global economic growth. My top stock picks for January 2025 represent a diverse mix of market leaders with strong competitive positions and growth potential. Microsoft leads in technology and AI, UnitedHealth Group dominates healthcare, Visa benefits from digital payments growth, Costco shows retail resilience, and Devon Energy offers value and income. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies' strong fundamentals and market positions make them compelling investments for the current market environment.

The company serves more than 50 million members and continues to innovate in healthcare delivery and cost management. UnitedHealth's appeal lies in its consistent growth and expanding healthcare services ecosystem. The company's Optum division grew revenues by 25% to $56.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2024, with operating margins improving to 8.9%. The insurance segment maintains a stable medical care ratio of 82.1%, indicating effective cost management. UnitedHealth added 2.2 million new members in 2024, bringing its total to 52.5 million, while revenue per consumer increased by 8%. The company's investment in digital health technologies has reduced administrative costs by $2.1 billion annually.

Key Metrics: Visa maintains its position as the world's largest payment processor, benefiting from the ongoing shift to digital payments and cross-border transaction growth. The company's network processes over 185 billion transactions annually. Visa's compelling investment case is strengthened by its exceptional financial metrics and growth trajectory. The company processed $3.1 trillion in payment volume in fourth-quarter 2024, up 16% year over year, while cross-border volumes surged 22% as international travel recovered. Operating margins reached an impressive 67%, leading to $4.8 billion in quarterly net income. Visa's return on invested capital of 45% demonstrates its capital efficiency, while its network of 80 million merchant locations provides a strong moat. The company's investments in new payment technologies, including $1.2 billion in blockchain and real-time payment solutions, positions it well for future growth. Trading at a forward P/E of 28.6x, Visa offers reasonable value given its projected 15% annual earnings growth and 54% net income margins. Key Metrics: Costco continues to excel in retail with its membership-based model, offering high-quality products at competitive prices. The company's focus on customer value and operational efficiency has driven consistent growth in both sales and membership. Costco's appeal as a top pick is reinforced by its stellar operational metrics and growth initiatives. The company's membership renewal rate reached a record 93%, while membership fee income grew 8.5% to $4.2 billion annually. same-store sales growth of 5.2% outpaced major retailers, while e-commerce sales surged 15%. Costco's international expansion continues with 28 new warehouses planned for 2025, including 10 in Asia where average store productivity is 15% higher than U.S. locations. The company's private label Kirkland brand reached $65 billion in annual sales, growing 12% year over year and providing higher margins. Despite a seemingly high forward P/E of 59x, Costco's price-to-membership-fee ratio of 17x and consistent double-digit earnings growth justify the premium valuation. Key Metrics: Devon Energy has established itself as a leader in U.S. shale production, with premium assets in the Delaware Basin. The company's variable dividend policy returns significant cash to shareholders while maintaining operational flexibility. Devon Energy's attractiveness stems from its operational efficiency and shareholder-friendly policies. The company's Delaware Basin operations achieved a 45% return on capital at $70 oil prices, while production costs decreased 8% year-over-year. A free cash flow yield of 12% supports the company's variable dividend policy, which returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in 2024. Devon's debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 0.8x is among the lowest in the industry, providing flexibility for opportunistic acquisitions or additional shareholder returns. The company's hedging program locks in profitable prices for 60% of 2025 production, reducing downside risk. Trading at just 12.4x forward earnings with a 5.8% variable dividend yield, Devon offers significant value in an energy sector that remains critical to global economic growth. My top stock picks for January 2025 represent a diverse mix of market leaders with strong competitive positions and growth potential. Microsoft leads in technology and AI, UnitedHealth Group dominates healthcare, Visa benefits from digital payments growth, Costco shows retail resilience, and Devon Energy offers value and income. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies' strong fundamentals and market positions make them compelling investments for the current market environment.

Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what’s in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices.” “Growing momentum for Cabinet picks who could define Trump’s second term” [CNN]. “he Cabinet confirmation drama around Donald Trump’s most provocative picks [is] mostly about Trump himself, and the kind of presidency he wants, the one he will end up getting, and the hopes of his MAGA movement that he’ll stand firm on his vow to shake the federal administrative state to its core and enact his and their revenge.” As for Ernst: “The Iowa Republican had faced warnings on social media that she’d encounter a primary challenge in 2026 if she didn’t shelve her reservations about Hegseth. The president-elect’s son, Donald Trump Jr., last week, for instance, amplified a post on X that pointed out that Ernst had been among almost all GOP senators who voted to confirm President Joe Biden’s Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, saying that anyone who did so and then criticized Hegseth was maybe ‘in the wrong political party!'” “‘I Support Pete’: Ernst Changes Tune Following Second Hegseth Meeting” [The Federalist]. “Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, indicated she will confirm Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense on Monday. The announcement marks a stark pivot for Ernst, who has been leading a behind-the-scenes effort to tank Hegseth’s nomination. ‘I appreciate Pete Hegseth’s responsiveness and respect for the process,’ Ernst said in a press release. ‘Following our encouraging conversations, Pete committed to completing a full audit of the Pentagon and selecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women — based on quality and standards, not quotas — and who will prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks. As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.'” “Key GOP senators begin to fall in line to support Kash Patel and keep door open for Pete Hegseth” [CNN]. “Top GOP senators on Monday signaled support for Donald Trump’s plan to oust the current FBI director in favor of firebrand loyalist Kash Patel, while keeping the door open for Pete Hegseth, who faces a slate of misconduct allegations, as the president-elect’s pick to run the Pentagon…. It is still early in the vetting process for Trump’s Cabinet nominees and confirmation votes won’t take place until next year. But it is clear that GOP senators are being careful to pick their battles and cautious of how they approach the president-elect’s selections.” * * * “Cold Shoulder: Democrats Ignore Tulsi Gabbard’s Request To Meet” [CNN]. Worst of all, Gabbard was a DNC vice-chair, but resigned to endorse Sanders. “There is some evidence that skepticism of a muscular foreign policy has gained traction among younger Democrats and independents in the last four or five years. When Hillary Clinton questioned Gabbard’s logic and loyalty, Gabbard punched back. In a series of tweets, she called the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee “the queen of warmongers” and “personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.'” • Where’s the lie? The #Resistance “Sanctuary cities resist Trump’s deportation plan. It could cost their residents” [USA Today]. “While a post-election poll by YouGov for CBS News shows that a massive 73% of adults want President-elect Donald Trump to prioritize the repatriation of illegal migrants, the [Denver Mayor Mike Johnston] pledged to not only have Denver police ‘stationed at the county line to keep (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) out’ but also that ‘you would have 50,000 Denverites there.’ Johnston said it would be like a ‘Tiananmen Square moment’ and answered yes when questioned whether he’d be ready to go to jail. That moment soon passed, however, as lawyers apparently explained to the mayor that armed resistance to the federal government is often called – wait for it – insurrection.” • Oopsie. Democrats en déshabillé “Russiagate Remnants” [Michael R. Caputo, Racket News]. “All of us agree the original Russiagate conspiracy continues even today. The Russia hoax was created by Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, who carries on with his lies today as President Joe Biden’s national security advisor. Christopher Steele, the British spy hired by Clinton to create the dodgy dossier, and his Fusion GPS co-conspirator Glenn Simpson are still doing the same work for similar clients. Andrew Weissmann, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, and more still peddle their lies. Elements of the original conspiracy were woven into Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 American election, then bogus Trump impeachments, January 6th prosecutions, anti-Trump lawfare, and Special Counsel Jack Smith’s Mar-a-lago raid. FBI Director Patel can prove the original 2016 conspiracy continues today. Much of the evidence remains in federal and public databases. Preemptive pardons aside, that means Sullivan, Weissmann, Mary McCord, Steele, Simpson, Victoria Nuland, Alexander Vindman, Eric Ciaramella, Smith, and others may still be in the jackpot. We agree with attorney Mike Davis: these perpetrators potentially violated 18 U.S.C. § 241 and 242, federal civil rights statutes that prohibit conspiracies to violate the rights of others.” • Worth reading in full.

Airborne Transmission “AirFanta 3Pro Review – A High-Performance Yet Affordable Air Purifier” [BreatheSafeAir]. “After having the 3Pro set up inside my office for over two weeks now, I am happy to be able to present my full review of the device. For anyone unaware, this purifier is designed to filter a massive amount of air (we will discuss the CADR and more soon!) at a relatively affordable price. It does this by being essentially a pre-assembled CR (Corsi-Rosenthal) Box – a form of air purifier that was itself created due to the need for affordable and effective air purification devices. While the 3Pro doesn’t embrace the typical DIY aspect of traditional CR Boxes, it has the advantage of having proven performance (no need to worry about whether your DIY box is effective!) and being ready to go out of the box. However, perhaps my favourite aspect of this device over traditional CR Boxes is how easily obtainable it is. While this probably isn’t an issue for anyone in the U.S. or Europe, I find it hard to source good HEPA filters in New Zealand at an affordable price. The 3Pro ensures I don’t run into this issue.” • Worth a read if you’re in the market.

I believe that people can have rich, fulfilling lives with or without partners; I also know that courtship has never been easy. But research supports the idea that, in recent years, the United States has seen a particularly pronounced crisis of faith in romance. The Pew Research Center, in an analysis of census data, found that as of 2019, 38 percent of adults were unpartnered—that is, not married or living with a partner—compared with 29 percent in 1990. In a survey Pew conducted that same year, half of single adults said they were not seeking dates. When Pew divided that result by gender, it found that 61 percent of single men said they were looking to date or find a relationship while only 38 percent of single women said the same. In other words, straight partnerships seem to be going out not with a 4B-style bang but with a whimper. And however subtle the shift might seem, it has huge implications for men and women: how they treat each other, whether they’re willing to trust each other, and how they’ll build their futures—together or apart.” • Hmm.

When the game was adopted in Europe, the pieces and chessboard were painted in white and red, contrasting with the black and red sets common in India and the Middle East. It was only towards the end of the Middle Ages that the white versus black dichotomy became more favoured. A key factor in this shift was the advent of printing, where black ink was used on white paper, reinforcing the perception of these colours as natural opposites.” “Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension” [Educational Research Review] 2018. From the Discussion: “The results of the two meta-analyses in the present study yield a clear picture of screen inferiority, with lower reading comprehension outcomes for digital texts compared to printed texts, which corroborates and extends previous research (Kong et al., 2018; Singer & Alexander, 2017b; Wang et al., 2007). These results were consistent across methodologies and theoretical frameworks.” And: ” our results indicate that the screen inferiority effect has increased in the past 18 years, and that there were no differences in media effects between age groups. These surprising findings suggest that we cannot idly wait for screen inferiority to disappear as children are exposed to digital devices earlier and earlier in their lives, as adults gain more experience with the technology, or as technology improves. The data suggest that screen inferiority is a major challenge across age groups that becomes more severe as the presence of technology increases.” • Certainly conforms to my priors! * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Printed books, cards, and tabletop games come in handy during power outages. Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension I have been harping on this for some time, especially in regards to NC content. Good meaty posts and whenever Yves tells me to get a cup of coffee means I invariably copy and paste the words into a word processor and print it out. One could also hit the “Printer Friendly and PDF” at the end of the post, but I prefer the fancy OpenType fonts I have already installed in the word processor. Reading text on paper as opposed to monitors and phones will save your eyes, and your comprehension and memory of the content will be deeper. For example, I printed Rob Urie’s post today on the state of greedy health insurance. Of course, this means I miss out on participating in the comments. i have an old trailerhouse full of books. i call it “The Library”. but i can no longer read any of them without getting a headache or eyestrain. because i cant afford to go to the eye doctor(after almost 9 years) to get new real eyeglasses. so i’m stuck with “walmart readers” of varying magnification…yellow/green ones for in here in my bed, with laptop at the foot of it….purply ones for out at the bar…brown ones for in the truck…last actual prescriptions, held together with caulk, superglue and tape, in the golf cart. on the laptop, whether here, in bed, or out at bar, i an make these letters frelling huge, and do just that. i reckon that more healthcare executives need to be shot on the side of the road for the message to get through,lol. “Access to Healthcare” makes a nice slogan you can yammer on about…and your PMC healthcare might be awesome….but i have none at all….as do so very many of my compatriots. and when we hear how awesome obamacare is, in Texas, well…look over yer shoulder for the rest of your natural, and likely artificially extended, life.

The need however for members of Congress to express disdain for a civilization of 1.4 billion thoroughly benign people is saddening. At least this can be otherwise dismissed. Thank you so much. I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern. It is quite valid. And it is possible the same bill will come up in the next Congress, but it has to start from scratch – find sponsors, go through committees, etc. Congressional procedures can be arcane. These guys know how to work it. “I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern…” You are terrific. Where’s the lie? There isn’t one of course, which is a problem because truth and trust are the costly enemy, but lies, ignorance, and hatred are their profitable friends. And the Democrats reflexively, without any deliberations, destroy anyone who they think is the enemy Indeed. I think Gabbard will be the hardest nominee to confirm. She will be opposed by all Democrats of course. But most of the Republicans are also warmongering hawks. None of the other nominees, including Patel, have dared to question our foreign policy as openly as she has. Mumbling vaguely that we shouldn’t “get involved” in certain foreign conflicts is not the same thing as visiting Syria, saying Assad is not our enemy, and condemning our use of Islamist extremists as proxies against him. She will have her words thrown back in her face, forcing her to either dissemble with some sort of patriotic mush or stand by her words and admit “our government” was lying. What will she say about Assad now, for example? I think it may rather be what will Syria have to say about itself between now and any confirmation hearing. That is a two month window to find out what the uni-party has created and whether there will be calls for boots on the ground there, the responsibility to protect those helpless wheat fields and benign oil reserves. By the time of her confirmation hearings, Syria will be a Jihadist cesspool and nobody will have any appetite for putting boots on the ground. The repercussions of the fall of Syria will be plain to see and Gabbard will not be shy in pointing this out. Old Joe took the credit for Assad’s fall so now the consequences will be on the Democrats. By the time Gabbard hearings happen, our formerly cuddly Jihadis will be at war with Israel. (Heck, the way IDF is invading deep into Syria, it could start before the year is out.) That will cause some interesting contortions. For all we know, the shooter didn’t expect to survive. Perhaps he didn’t expect to survive, particularly given that he apparently suffers from severe chronic back pain. I had a friend who did himself in with pills and booze because of it. In any event, he’s become a cause celebre. Should he survive incarceration and not go the way of Epstein, his trial will be quite something. I wonder how deeply his defence will be allowed to explore and explain his motivation to a jury as a powerful mitigating circumstance, essentially putting the healthcare system on trial. I suppose jury nullification is a possibility but probably too much to hope for. I am sorry about your friend. I have (or had) a close relative who did the same at the age of 57. And now I too have the same back condition, though I avoid booze and pills. It really does put limitations on one’s life and a pall over one’s outlook. I can imagine it must be even more upsetting to a younger person — since you know will have to live with it that much longer. yeah. back problems are the worst. out of all my numerous broken bones and other sundry injuries to my skeleton, the 2 old, self-healed compression fractures in my back are the worst, by far. especially with cold fronts, hurricanes, etc. nothing you can do to get away from it. mine are likely from hauling feedsacks on one shoulder when i was much younger. nothing radicalisises you like constant pain, and an indifferent and uncaring healthcare system…but yer likely too frelled up to go all crazy like Luigi did. i sure as hell couldnt. my skeleton prevents travel. lucky for the aristocracy, i suppose. (yes, feeling murderous, tonight,lol….let lindsey graham or some other warmongering asshat wander in front of my truck tomorrow, and we’ll see…if i see them…in time.) Hannah Arendt noted that “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists.” Two things on the accused Adjuster. First, while a rapid arrest was no doubt greatly wished by TPTB, I’m not sure the guy they got, regardless of guilt, is the one they wanted or needed. This is someone, who with family, can take this to a trial where a guilty verdict is highly unlikely and where the defense will air a lot of facts and figures our politicians and Big Health (Insurance, private health providers, health services and Big Pharma) really really do not want to get a lot of air play. And even having a friendly judge will not help them, because anything they deny for the defense will be being aired in public regardless. Second is just amusing, had a conversation with a NYC police officer today about how so much of the surveillance video I see really does not provide enough detail for people to really recognize people or cars, especially since the general NYC public uniform of black clothing becomes a black blob. They threw in that they didn’t understand why the Adjuster went to Altoona and didn’t just stay in NYC. Mostly because for all the surveillance it really isn’t as comprehensive and easy as we think and with so many people it is much easier to just blend in with the crowd. Maybe the Adjuster believes that the surveillance system in NYC is more all-powerful than the systems in other places. However, I notice that that NYC police officer either assumes that NYC Guy and Altoona Guy are the same guy, or he wants everyone hearing/reading his words to assume it. I for one do not assume it. So I have no way of knowing whether NYC Guy ever went to Altoona or not. Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. And it can leave lasting issues in maybe most patients that are worse than the original issue ever was. If we wanted to set the DOGE police on medicine, one of the easiest low-hanging fruits would be the abuse of back surgery. 35 years ago – the rule was – No back surgery unless the patient is paralyzed (or with a clear imminent impending paralysis) and there is possible hope of reversing that. THE END. Now there are surgeons doing “minimally invasive” procedures 10 times a day. It seldom works well. And it can be castastrophically tragic for many. This is ESPECIALLY true of the morbidly obese – they should lose weight. And the young jock types – they should be doing core work and extra training – not surgery. The problem with doing this on a young athlete is their life, their exercise and their ability to perform will never be the same. And this does not go well for so many of them. The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. We have a chronic pain problem here in the USA – we have completely out of control expectations and it leads to so many tragedies. Always remember – this one issue has been what I would call the “nexus” of the opioid epidemic. When these surgeries go bad – and they almost always do – the patient is left in varying degrees of horrific pain – ready to self-medicate or worse. And always remember – this type of surgery is a HUGE moneymaker for Big Hospital – there are entire hospitals across the land that do nothing but this. It is ripe for fraud – and this has played out among back surgeons going to jail all over this country. And never forget the story of Dr. Death. Again – I have no qualms about the DOGE dogs being unleashed on this. Something must be done. Thanks. One of my aunts had back surgery and everything you just said. I’m old enough to have arthritis, which runs in the family, and for awhile could barely walk due to swollen knees. Ever since I’ve tried to walk a couple of miles per day and don’t have any trouble at all with my legs. Of course younger people may not have the time to take walks. But perhaps you have to avoid the magic bullets as one gets older and go old school. IM Doc Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. [ This is precisely what the chair of orthopedics at Harvard explained at a dinner. ] Forgive me for not be clearer. As I understood the chair of orthopedics, the problem was in using surgery for pain that could be and should rather be resolved by physical therapy or routine exercise. Much back pain can be resolved, I learned, by strengthening stomach muscles with bent-knee sit-ups. In college, there were a number of helpful exercises that wrestlers used for their backs, rowers as well and even for me as a runner. I was only repeating in summary dinner comments that stayed with me. I, for instance, as a runner, used bent-knee sit-ups for my back each day. Amen. “Core Strength” is key to a healthy life and old age; balanced back and front work that keep your body working normally. However, most people would rather die and be disabled than to arse themselves to work on this. Thankfully, my orthopedic Docs at Stanford, one for back, another for knees, are both strong proponents of physical therapy, reserving surgery as a last resort. Just to balance the narrative – I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer. I went from being unable to walk to being fine. For a pain free and full mobility quarter century, I am most grateful. The only lasting effect is a slight weakness on the side that had the pinched sciatic nerve, and that was much worse before the surgery. I do believe physical therapy after surgery helped in my case. Pretty much the same with me. Had a herniated disc and had to use a walker to get anywhere. The surgery was straightforward and recovery quick. However, I believe any fusion of back bones should be avoided. “I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer…” I much appreciate the balancing, and am pleased for you. A Doctor partially paralyzed my step grandpa after a back surgery gone wrong. He retired as a City Bud Driver and had chronic pain. Then why do the insurance companies approve these procedures? To sell profitable pain killers for years through their pharma subsidiary, at least that’s what United Healthcare does. How does back surgery mesh with the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) cheer-leaders, or do profits put a thumb on the scale? (I’m still having problems wrapping my head around US-backed Jihadis promising Diversity and Democracy.) That’s only because you think they believe or mean those promises. If you decide to believe that they are being coached to say it for the cameras for the time being, then you won’t have problems wrapping your head around it. Remember the deathless words of Erdogan. ” I see that Democracy is like a bus. I get on it and ride till it gets me where I want to go. Then I get off.” I don’t believe in anything except the Kalama Sutta and I watch what the hands are doing. To paraphrase Sid Arthur from 2500 years or so ago, “Go kick a rock.” The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. Years, in my case. 12-24 months after starting I was still getting episodes, and things were better but not by all that much. It felt like I was making no progress. Somehow I kept at it and things did change (slowly) and today after >10 years I’m barely troubled by it any more. I know it’s still there – sometimes something sets it off – but it’s a minor niggle for a few days and doesn’t prevent me from doing anything I want to do or cause any serious discomfort. It used to wipe me out completely for weeks on end. I think what kept me going was noticing small improvements in things I hadn’t even realized were a problem. After 6-12 months I could stand for longer than an hour without needing to sit down. I hadn’t even realized that was abnormal. I realized that if I stopped, things would just keep getting worse. aye. guy who did my hip replacement actually warned me away from any back surgery to fix these compression fractures….and the big ortho outfit he worked for had that as a big part of their business model. and, please IMDoc, remember that not all of us long term opioid patients are junkies. the vicodin doesnt remove the pain, but it does mitigate it( i miss it when i miss a dose)…and when i do my every 2 or 3 year drug holiday to reset the receptors and start again at 5mg, i have had zero withdrawal symptoms. careful with big brushes,lol. Great post, thanks. Working hard to keep my back muscles strong enough to never develop chronic pain. And worried sick my 80-something friends are going down a similar road with the electrophysiologists, so very eager to implant devices in anyone with sometimes-erratic heartbeats. A lifesaver, sure, for some. A really nice money-maker for them? Also sure. It makes me leery. I am lucky that my back pain was managed by the VA, who had undertaken a whole new approach to pain management. No opiates and invasive procedures unless absolutely necessary. Wholistic approach which included education, physical therapy, “non-traditional” procedures like acupuncture, and very mild, non-opiate based painkillers as necessary. I did undergo ablasion, which certainly helped. The combination of all of these has kept me reasonably pain-free for five years now, with occasional flare-ups which I can manage using the knowledge gained from the pain-management classes, with massage, acupuncture and exercises. All in all, it has allowed me to remain active and go on long hikes with reasonable weight load. The question is, why don’t private insurers stimulate more hospital systems to go to that approach? I am reasonably certain that my care was both cheaper, monetarily and socialy, and more effective, than what’s being offered to the privately insured. Ernst is playing a role. Can’t have Thune, protégé of Turtle, get sullied with any pre-nomination discourse or controversy. Keep that powder, or those favors, for future matters. Meanwhile, Ernst gets some press visibility. Win-win for the Shell game and Turtle legacy protection. A question: Will NC take a closer look at Romania and the annulled election? It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal, if one takes the notion of free elections in the EU seriously. It is a de-facto Russiagate à la roumaine that has changed the outcome of a political process for real. That is quite something. Taibbi should be looking into this….(did he?) Romania is also interesting since it’s a textbook case of old and new elites realigning after ’89. The place never came to peace. Which is why people don’t take politics there seriously. It’s pretty tragic and ugly. “It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal…” Given the givens, I’m surprised that you’re surprised. The bit of MSM news I saw recently accentuated the dastardly deployment of Russian backed social media as being responsible for voters making an unacceptable choice. After the Moldovan President was re-elected based on the votes coming from the Moldovan diaspora and not those living in Moldova, it is no surprise. Ursula is centralizing as much power as she can in Brussels so I can see a day when it will be Brussels that will dictate the authenticity of an election held and maybe even who is allowed to stand for office. More of those “EU values” that we keep on hearing about. Well, they just canceled election because they lost, and the reason given is far more ridiculous than the original Russiagate. So I guess there is not much to talk about, if the Romanians themselves accept it without fight. Maybe that’s the actual message, that everyone sort of accepts EU is fixing election right and left, like nobody was making big fuss about the fairness of latest “election” in USSR. Don’t forget that Pres Yoon of SK claiming thst he ordered martial law as a measure against electoral fraud. Re: Don’t throw away your printed books […] I am eagerly awaiting my option to subscribe to NC in print! re: “Don’t throw away your printed books: I am divided on this. Do I really read F Scott Fitzgerald differently, do I process it differently when reading it as a printed book in contrast to reading it on an e-book reader? How deep does the scientific evidence reach here? Is it merely external phenoma that are measured? Or more substantial internal matters? How far can brain functions be identified with 100% certainty and connected with genuine different results? Is it due to the technology itself? Or due to the notion of multi-tasking? Which would have nothing to do with possible inferiority of the technology of reading on digital devices as such. I can’t comment about e-readers because I don’t own one, but my experience tells me that I undoubtedly process words better on paper than on screen. And by “process” I don’t necessarily mean high level deep emotional processing (prefrontal cortex, amygdala) but rather lower level visual processing (retina, thalamus). Reading nice serif fonts on paper affords me less eye strain and fatigue, which could indirectly allow me to better comprehend the content of the text I am reading. You ask some very tough questions about how we can even measure brain functions and how it relates to reading comprehension. I don’t have a good answers, but you can still reap benefits of not reading all day on screens. It’s like intuitively understanding that eating lots of un-manufactured and unprocessed vegetables is a great idea even if you don’t have a good understanding of how digestion affects health. NC’s favorite contributor, Michael Hudson, agrees in his most recent article on how publishing monopolies are squeezing writers. Hudson laments screens causing him eyestrain and the publishers insisting on using tiny print with ugly typefaces on the paper versions. As knowledgeable as Hudson is, he probably doesn’t have the clout to dictate the typography in his books. (Whose poor idea was it to not include an index in Killing The Host? I doubt it was Michael himself.) Edward Tufte certainly has the clout to tell publishers how to style and design his books. Take a look at Tufte’s books. They have the most beautiful graphic design and typography. (I believe Tufte commonly uses the Sabon font in his books.) Needless to say I grew up a printed book person. However I am asking the “devil’s advocate’s” questions because I lack some knowledge on this that you might have and others on NC. Meaning: the serious scientific scholarship on this. Those who’s jobs in publishing it is to read books for real were the first ones who – as my circle of friends is concerned – were all with the “digital revolution” simply for practical reasons. There are as you say all sorts of issues involved. My underlying question is indeed if it hade made a difference to me had I grown up with the same titles but not in print but well readable digital devices. A nice cruel experiment with twins growing up! As you and matt below point out, various needs make for various purchases. The most common I guess is print for reading and making notes (I at least cannot read and making notes on digital devices. It makes serious research impossible.) But the second purchase is the pdf to research studies which I already have worked through or for works that I have no time to check. (Admittedly a practice more often used due to commenting on blogs which is not a paid job after all. So at some point time is an issue.) But still the questions that you already pointed at for me (prefrontal cortex, amygdala /retina, thalamus) – are the ones of a normative magnitude. It’s like with mask mandates during Covid: Do masks not work because the virus slips through the material. Or do they not work because people are too lazy to use them properly or at all. From the scientific POV two completely different answers. But mixed in the public arena. As the quality of publishing goes – I believe so far Germany in this area is still a safehaven if you work with one of the Classic publishers and not some online outfit or self-publishing (which I would assume lacks the money). On the other hand I have encountered micro-trends where certain publishers fell for new trendy fonts which I found detestable. Thanks also for the Hudson link. US capitalism is full of surprises… my sister likes collecting printed books ‘in case something happens.’ and i agree it is nice to have paper books for power outages. but as a student, i am NOT about to purchase and lug around 5 massive textbooks all day. if you’re reading a book for fun, printed copies are nice. but for other reasons, they are not. or when it is wet. they are two technologies with different uses. sometimes you need a book but it’s expensive so all you have is a pirated pdf. also it’s easier to read in bed on your phone. instead of holding a flashlight under the sheets like i used to as a kid, i can simply read on the phone. I have to do log book entries for my work as an aircraft mechanic. Sometimes they are 500 to 1000 words. Filled with part numbers and manual references. I learned along time ago that I can’t proof read on the computer screen. I print it out and make corrections. Then print on sticky paper and paste in the book. re: Don’t Throw Away Your Printed Books Here is the link to the article, which at least on my screen, did not come through: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300101 ‘Donald J.

Go to https://gettrumpfragrances.com. Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!’ Will it be as good as Zelensky Number Five? One whiff of that and you will be willing to bankrupt your entire country to give Zelensky all the billions that he wants. What do people think of the alleged manifesto by alleged American folk hero The Adjuster, Luigi Mangione? https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto “To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn’t working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.” But when he goes to trial, will the judge rule that inadmissible in court? Gotta watch those New York courts Why would it be inadmissible? Self-incrimination? But it was written before he was arrested. If it is admitted into court, then that brings the whole question of why he did what he did. Is that a can of worms that the courts want to open? The state of American healthcare? It would be safer to declare him insane and put him away and not go there. The big question is did Luigi actually write this. Commenters on Twitter are saying that it doesn’t read like his other posts online, like his GoodReads reviews. Also, I just can’t get my head around why someone who went to such lengths not to get caught and managed to escape NYC would then allow himself to get caught. At least turn yourself in to make the political statement. So much that seems unaccountable. Why did he stay ten whole days in New York? And in a hostel that requires in-person check-in and in which you’d be sharing a room with other guests? As for the final sentence, “I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty…” a kind of invitation to other adjustors? Mind you, no way on earth I would take up that invitation even if I can’t begrudge anyone who does. Sounds less Marxist than German Red Army Faction. But the gist is the same. The last couple of years made it difficult for people to further promote and believe in the idea of constructive grass-roots movements changing matters down to top. For some time now left groups had mostly abandonded force, violence, murder. Wonder how long that remains. Might we see more of this? I haven’t followed this closely as I usually don’t like murder stories. (However the sane political rationale makes it more interesting of course.) I wouldn’t be surprised if this event was instrumentalized as another pro-Dems story confirming the fears of violence under a Trump administration. Simply by Trump being there. Even without any proven affiliation. As of “the billionaire”-class won etc. re: “ Why did he stay ten whole days in New York?” He had theatre tickets? wanted to see the tree at Rockefeller Center? Skating in Central Park? The “Sienna” exhibit at the Met Museum (It’s very good)? “Frau Ohne Schatten” with Nina Stemme at the Met Opera ? (Also good). why does anybody stay in NYC for 10 days? Amazing that he had the time to gun anybody down. 😂 would make for a great comedy: “The man who wanted to be assassin. (But didn’t make it in time.)” Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. Which Obama and Biden never did or likely considered. Meanwhile Republicans fear their base and Trump exercises political power.

He learned the hard way that the US is not agreement-capable. He should have been reading alt-media … next time call crime stoppers, and let the perp walk! About that ” don’t throw away your printed books” article . . . I wonder whether people who learned to do their high-level reading on printed text are able to comprehend text on screens just as well as if it were printed. The reason I don’t throw away my printed books is so that I will still have something printed if/when the entire Internet and the entire digisphere goes dark and stays dark for good. Interesting. But then we did once have to learn how to read paper books and for some of us that happened very early. So I think the point is that it’s really about what’s in the books and the technology is a sidebar. Personally I did have trouble adjusting to reading ebooks and found that making the screen presentation–sharpness, serif text, a preferred two page per screen format–as much like a real book was the way to go. For this reason the old e-ink Kindle was a pain. There are Bezos’ good ideas and–so many–Bezos’ bad ideas. Meanwhile computer displays are now very sharp indeed and the contrast is unbeatable. Now I have trouble reading paper books. Of course paper copies of books should be kept somewhere and we once thought and perhaps still think this is the public library’s job. But it seems they aren’t into being archivists Most libraries nowadays are actively landfilling books so they can build studios to teach the kids how to Tiktok. Because that is what the kids need to know. Too bad we don’t have a Carnegie to donate the money and dictate that the libraries should do something other than what the Propaganda Broadcasting System (PBS) tells them is relevant. “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” Of course where Dachau is located would make a great site for rural-residential living in a new gated community and conveniently situated near Munich. Why yes, there will be guards but they will be for keeping people out, not like the previous ones that had the job of keeping people in. The MSM has been talking about how people need to switch to “secure” communications on their cell phones becasue of Chinese hacking, but apparently, it’s MUCH more serious than that.

The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a resounding defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But the Ukrainians and Americans should be reminded that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelenskyi not to negotiate with Russia, but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. Agreed. But Trump will need to cut Ukraine loose quickly. Otherwise it becomes his tar baby.

The group sentenced the party as “politically dead,” demanding its dismantlement. This is a very long post. But I can’t provide a link only since an archived article cannot be auto-translated. At least I wouldn´t know how. – Scott Horton Interview BERLINER ZEITUNG – “The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost” – Scott Horton in an interview The representatives of an aggressive US foreign policy bear a large share of the responsibility for the war in Ukraine, says the American author Scott Horton in an interview. The war in Ukraine is currently reaching a turning point. The Ukrainian army seems to have little left to oppose the Russian army. President Volodymyr Selenskyj has admitted that he will have to come to terms with ceding territory to Russia. Will there be peace negotiations under US President Donald Trump? The American radio presenter and publicist Scott Horton has examined the history of the war in his new book “Provoked. How Washington started the New Cold War with Russia and the catastrophe in Ukraine”. The Berliner Zeitung spoke to him about the long-term goals of the USA, the role of Angela Merkel and possible peace scenarios. Mr. Horton, the war in Ukraine has been raging for almost three years now. The USA is Kiev’s most important ally. What are the long-term goals of the American government in Ukraine? It’s complicated. Essentially, they want to integrate Ukraine into the so-called American security umbrella and install a government that is friendly to them. Russia has been pressured with NATO’s constant eastward expansion. Of course, Russia’s neighbors wanted American protection. But the problem is that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to a country like Ukraine, which is of paramount importance to Russia. When the US declared that Ukraine should become a member of the Western security architecture, a threshold was crossed. The US has been playing out NATO membership for Ukraine since the 1990s. But the smartest members of the American leadership have always warned against it. Ukraine’s history and Russia’s history are deeply intertwined. Russia has a significant strategic interest in the Sevastopol naval base in Crimea. The American strategy of integrating Ukraine out of Russia’s sphere of interest and into the Western sphere of influence became a direct threat to Russia, provoking a reaction. Would you say that the American government underestimated Russia? The part of the American establishment that was counting on further western integration of Ukraine did not think that Russia would invade Ukraine. I recall the words of Senator Chris Murphy, who praised the US role in overthrowing the government on television after the so-called Maidan revolution of 2014. Murphy said: “We did a great job.” The moderator then asked whether this might not provoke a conflict with Russia. Murphy replied: “That would be crazy.” He assumed that Russia would not intervene. A few weeks later, Ukraine lost Crimea and the east of the country was at war. In her biography, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the decision not to admit Ukraine into NATO at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest. What effect did Merkel’s decision have at the time? Well, the so-called hawks, who stand for an aggressive American foreign policy, argue that if Ukraine had been given far-reaching military commitments at the time, the war would not have started in the first place, because Putin would not have attacked any NATO member. I think the more plausible answer is that Russia would have immediately launched an invasion of Ukraine, even before the NATO treaties were signed. The then US President George W. Bush was warned. The American ambassador to Russia, William Burns, wrote a memorandum in February 2008, published by Wikileaks, entitled “Njet means Njet. Russia’s Nato Enlargement Redlines”. In it, Burns warned his boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, against bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. It was not just about Putin. For the entire Russian security apparatus, this would have crossed a line. In his memoirs, Burns later reported an email to Rice in which he explained to her what a sensitive point the issue was for Russia. Merkel and French President François Hollande did everything they could to stop Bush. But Bush was determined. They agreed to a compromise not to guarantee Ukraine a NATO membership process, but only that Kiev would one day be given the prospect of a NATO membership process. Merkel’s stance against Bush was in line with the leadership of the American security services and the US State Department. So was it a far-sighted decision by the then German Chancellor? Merkel was deeply concerned about provoking Russia. She did not think about what economic costs Germany would face in the event of a military conflict. The only question was, why should she provoke Putin if Germany could not gain any benefits from it. While President Joe Biden has always been a strong military supporter of Ukraine, his successor Donald Trump has announced that he will stop military aid to Ukraine. Why do the Democrats in the US have a stronger interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I am not sure if that is the case. The political right accuses the Democrats of money laundering and shady dealings in Ukraine. I do not know anything specific about that. I think the scandal surrounding Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who is said to have received bribes from Ukraine is not decisive. It starts earlier: Hunter Biden was installed at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings to protect the company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevskyj. Zlochevskyj was closely linked to the government of the fugitive President Viktor Yanukovych. That is why he sought protection from the Americans. Burisma hired Hunter Biden, as well as the former CIA officer Cofer Black and the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski. To return to your question: Do the Democrats have a greater strategic interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I would put it this way: the bipartisan consensus in US foreign policy is absolutely in agreement with Joe Biden. The new right that supports Trump is against an interventionist US foreign policy. The Republican establishment, such as the Republican minority leader in the US Senate, Mitch McConnell, is fully in line with the aggressive US foreign policy of George W. Bush, John McCain and Joe Biden. Their main concern now is damage limitation. The USA suffered a devastating defeat in Ukraine. It is just like in Afghanistan and Vietnam. The USA financed the war for years and millions of people died. In the end, the Reds were in Saigon, and today the Taliban are back in power in Kabul. The USA has plunged Ukraine into terrible chaos. In order to effectively push Russia back, the USA would have to station its own soldiers in Ukraine. But the price of a nuclear escalation would be too high for that. The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost. The willingness of the American public to continue supporting Ukraine in the fight against Russia is declining. Why do the majority of Americans no longer support the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky? Because it is obvious that we have been lied to. They said we will support Ukraine against Russia for as long as it takes. But it was supposed to take a year or two. The media often tell the joke: “Russia has the second strongest army in the world. But it looks more like they only have the second strongest army in Ukraine.” But now the war has been going on for three years, and the leading newspapers in the USA agree, and Zelensky is also aware, that Ukraine will have to give up territory. The American public is not so interested in what is happening in Donetsk Oblast. They are much more concerned about the fact that bridges are eroding in their own country and that their own government is abandoning them in the event of serious natural disasters. When Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina in September, the U.S. Army could have provided assistance. There are several locations in the state. Where were the Blackhawk helicopters to rescue Americans from the floods? They were in Europe supporting NATO and on their way to the Middle East. As people in North Carolina were fighting for survival, President Biden announced that another billion-dollar package for Ukraine would be approved. This is a major point why the Democrats lost the presidential election. The war in Ukraine pushed the German economy into recession. Since then, Germany no longer imports cheap gas from Russia, but expensive LNG from the USA. Is this just a combination of unfortunate circumstances? The Germans are the collateral damage in America’s economic war against Russia. The aim was to prevent as many Russian gas exports to the West as possible and to drive Russia into national bankruptcy. But that is not working. Russia is now exporting its gas to the East. American geostrategists, such as George Friedmann from the think tank Stratfor, discuss it surprisingly openly that the absolute priority for the USA is to separate Russia from Germany. The function of NATO is to keep America in, Germany down and the Russians out, as the first NATO Secretary General Lord Ismay described it in 1949. An alliance between Germany, the industrial superpower, and Russia, the resource superpower, would dominate Eastern Europe and destroy the influence of the Americans and British in the region. It is no coincidence that Senator Ted Cruz from my home state of Texas was a staunch opponent of the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline during the Trump and Biden years. Texas produces much of the American LNG that the US profitably supplies to Germany. Victoria Nuland, the former European representative at the US State Department, said to Cruz: “Well, Senator, what you always wanted has happened: Nord Stream 2 is a lump of metal on the seabed.” The Ukrainian president is increasingly losing support among the population. Do you think he will be able to hold on if Ukraine continues to go on the defensive? Zelenskyy has strengthened his power by suspending the presidential election and imposing martial law. It will depend on whether there will be powerful challengers who can offer an alternative. It also depends on which part of the population you ask. The further west you go, the more often you get the answer that the fight against Russia should continue. If you go to the east of the country, you are told to rely on negotiations. A serious problem is that neo-Nazis are gaining strong influence in Ukraine. Dmytro Yarosh and Andrei Biletsky have threatened Zelensky and his predecessor Petro Poroshenko with death. New York Times journalist Andrew Kramer has reported in detail on the danger posed by these people. They are actual descendants of Hitler’s collaborators in Ukraine who fought in World War II. They do not want to accept a ceasefire. For them, it would be a betrayal of the many soldiers who died in the war. They do not want to give up until they have won. If Zelensky starts peace negotiations, he will be in serious danger in the country. So, how will things turn out in Ukraine: Will we see peace in the next few weeks? I fear that the situation in Ukraine is so difficult that Trump will have a hard time making a deal. The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a crushing defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But it is worth reminding Ukrainians and Americans that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelensky not to negotiate with Russia but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. But there are still some doubts as to whether Trump is even seeking peace with Russia. After all, he has chosen many hawks for his government team. And he is in no position to make any demands on Moscow. Given the current military situation, Putin can draw the border pretty much wherever he wants. The question is whether he will expand to Kharkiv and Odessa, or whether he will just annex the oblasts he already controls. The optimistic scenario would be an agreement that freezes the conflict and draws the border where it currently is. Your email address will not be published.

But on Tuesday, after he presented a proposal at Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting, the shareholders said no. In October, Microsoft told investors that the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, intended to submit a shareholder proposal recommending that the software company's board look at diversifying its balance sheet with bitcoin. Saylor, now MicroStrategy's executive chairman, has seen his company's stock price soar almost 500% this year as it buys billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. "Microsoft can't afford to miss the next technology wave, and bitcoin is that wave," Saylor said in a video presentation, which he released on X last week. The post has more than 3 million views. In his three-minute presentation, Saylor displayed a chart showing that bitcoin generated annual returns of 62% between August 2020 and November 2024, compared with 18% for Microsoft and 14% for the S&P 500. Bonds as an asset class have lost 5%, the presentation says. "You can convert your cash flows and your dividends and your buybacks and your debt into bitcoin," Saylor said. "If you do that, you'll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price." The virtual appearance Tuesday wasn't the first time Saylor has made the pitch to Microsoft, which was sitting on $78.4 billion worth of cash, equivalents and short-term investments, as of the end of September. Microsoft said in its proxy filing in October that its treasury and investment services team previously evaluated bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund the company's operations and reduce economic risk, and "continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making." A day later, Saylor directly addressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on X. "Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me," Saylor wrote. The proposal failed to garner support from a majority of voting shareholders, after Microsoft recommended they reject it, with just 0.55% of votes in favor, according to a Wednesday filing. Proxy advisors Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both suggested a no vote, too. Microsoft started accepting cryptocurrency for customer payments in 2014, Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said in response to a shareholder question during Tuesday's meeting. "We continue to think about the evolution of crypto," she said. Microsoft shares have gained about 19% so far this year, far underperforming MicroStrategy. But Saylor has tied his company, now valued at about $83 billion, directly to the fortunes of bitcoin. In mid-2020, the company, which had been a middling software business, announced its plan to invest in bitcoin, disclosing in an earnings call that it would commit $250 million over the next 12 months to "one or more alternative assets," which could include digital currencies such as bitcoin. At the time, MicroStrategy's market cap was about $1.1 billion. As of Dec. 8, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries owned a total of about 423,650 bitcoins, acquired at an aggregate price of roughly $26.5 billion. With bitcoin trading at $95,000, those holdings are worth over $41.3 billion. MicroStrategy has been selling stock and raising debt to help fund its bitcoin purchases. The company said on Nov. 21 that it had completed a $3 billion convertible debt sale "to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes." Saylor's net worth has ballooned to $9.1 billion, according to Forbes, primarily due to his MicroStrategy ownership. WATCH: Michael Saylor on MicroStrategy and bitcoin Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Pixtral 12B is now available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/pixtral-12b-is-now-available-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T18:21:22Z
Full Content:
Today, we are excited to announce that Pixtral 12B (pixtral-12b-2409), a state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) from Mistral AI that excels in both text-only and multimodal tasks, is available for customers through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. You can try this model with SageMaker JumpStart, a machine learning (ML) hub that provides access to algorithms and models that can be deployed with one click for running inference. In this post, we walk through how to discover, deploy, and use the Pixtral 12B model for a variety of real-world vision use cases. Pixtral 12B represents Mistral’s first VLM and demonstrates strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming other open models and matching larger models, according to Mistral. Pixtral is trained to understand both images and documents, and shows strong abilities in vision tasks such as chart and figure understanding, document question answering, multimodal reasoning, and instruction following, some of which we demonstrate later in this post with examples. Pixtral 12B is able to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. Unlike other open source models, Pixtral doesn’t compromise on text benchmark performance, such as instruction following, coding, and math, to excel in multimodal tasks. Mistral designed a novel architecture for Pixtral 12B to optimize for both speed and performance. The model has two components: a 400-million-parameter vision encoder, which tokenizes images, and a 12-billion-parameter multimodal transformer decoder, which predicts the next text token given a sequence of text and images. The vision encoder was newly trained that natively supports variable image sizes, which allows Pixtral to be used to accurately understand complex diagrams, charts, and documents in high resolution, and provides fast inference speeds on small images like icons, clipart, and equations. This architecture allows Pixtral to process any number of images with arbitrary sizes in its large context window of 128,000 tokens. License agreements are a critical decision factor when using open-weights models. Similar to other Mistral models, such as Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Mixtral 8x22B and Mistral Nemo 12B, Pixtral 12B is released under the commercially permissive Apache 2.0, providing enterprise and startup customers with a high-performing VLM option to build complex multimodal applications. SageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch. With SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. The models can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia powered instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune the model, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability.With SageMaker, you can streamline the entire model deployment process. Note that fine-tuning on Pixtral 12B is not yet available (at the time of writing) on SageMaker JumpStart. To try out Pixtral 12B in SageMaker JumpStart, you need the following prerequisites: You can access Pixtral 12B through SageMaker JumpStart in the SageMaker Studio UI and the SageMaker Python SDK. In this section, we go over how to discover the models in SageMaker Studio. SageMaker Studio is an IDE that provides a single web-based visual interface where you can access purpose-built tools to perform ML development steps, from preparing data to building, training, and deploying your ML models. For more details on how to get started and set up SageMaker Studio, refer to Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic. Deployment starts when you choose Deploy. When deployment is complete, an endpoint is created. You can test the endpoint by passing a sample inference request payload or by selecting the testing option using the SDK. When you use the SDK, you will see example code that you can use in the notebook editor of your choice in SageMaker Studio. To deploy using the SDK, we start by selecting the Mistral Nemo Base model, specified by the model_id with the value huggingface-vlm-mistral-pixtral-12b-2409. You can deploy your choice of any of the selected models on SageMaker with the following code: This deploys the model on SageMaker with default configurations, including the default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. The end-user license agreement (EULA) value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA. Also, make sure that you have the account-level service limit for using ml.p4d.24xlarge or ml.pde.24xlarge for endpoint usage as one or more instances. To request a service quota increase, refer to AWS service quotas. After you deploy the model, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. In this section, we provide examples of inference on Pixtral 12B with example prompts. We use the following image as input for OCR. We use the following prompt: For chart understanding and analysis, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: We get the following output: For an image-to-code example, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: After you are done, delete the SageMaker endpoints using the following code to avoid incurring unnecessary costs: In this post, we showed you how to get started with Mistral’s newest multi-modal model, Pixtral 12B, in SageMaker JumpStart and deploy the model for inference. We also explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including other Mistral AI models, such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x22B.

The stock's worst day of 2024 had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 69% for the year, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999. After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate. Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle's cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue. "A bit of a stumble here for a stock that's created some lofty expectations for itself," wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said "we still like oracle heading into 2025." For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57. Oracle's biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers. The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement. Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 "based on continued cloud momentum." They cited Oracle's cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

The Texas Stock Exchange is getting ready to plant its flag in the Dallas real estate market. The upstart bourse backed by investors including BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities will open a temporary headquarters this spring at the Weir’s Plaza building, just north of downtown Dallas. The search is on for a permanent home, to be called the Texas Market Center, the company said in an emailed statement. Once built, the headquarters will house executive offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell as the the TXSE seeks to take on established markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A museum meant to showcase the history of modern business in Texas will also sit in the market center. The Dallas-Fort Worth area now has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York, as companies from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Charles Schwab Corp. expand operations. The TXSE is aiming to build on the state’s reputation for low taxes and a lighter regulatory touch, saying that companies that list on the market won’t need to meet environmental, social and governance thresholds beyond standard regulatory requirements. “The Texas Market Center will add to the vibrancy of Dallas’ thriving business community, and we believe it will drive further investment and corporate interest in the city and surrounding region,” James Lee, chief executive officer and founder of TXSE Group Inc., said in the statement. Texas has also increasingly lured corporations and financial firms from blue states such as New York and California. Texas is also developing a business-court system with an eye to handling more of the complex corporate litigation that Delaware is known for. The TXSE said earlier this year that it expects to handle its first trades in 2025 and host its first listing in 2026. The Texas venture is trying to muscle in on a business that consists of about 16 equities exchanges with widely varying trading volumes. Elsewhere in Dallas, the exchange plans to operate a data center to go with facilities in New Jersey and Chicago. Earlier this year, it hired executives from Charles Schwab, Nasdaq and the NYSE.

Title: Tech Workers Are Flocking To Financial Services
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/12/10/tech-workers-are-flocking-to-financial-services/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T17:26:09Z

As automation advances, the demand for tech workers skilled in machine learning, natural language ... [+] processing and large language models is growing. As artificial intelligence increasingly serves as a key driving force in business strategies across all sectors, this shift is altering the labor market, allowing technology workers to explore opportunities beyond their traditional industry. The tech job market, while more tempered compared to recent years, remains robust in the financial sector. Major banks are actively pursuing talent, attracting a significant influx of skilled professionals to their ranks. While tech firms continue to be the primary employers of recent tech graduates, the financial services industry is gaining ground. At Cornell University, the proportion of computer science graduates entering the financial services sector increased from 16% in 2022 to 22% in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported. Similarly, Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College saw a rise in the percentage of master of information systems management graduates choosing careers in financial services, from 16% between 2018 and 2021 to 19% between 2020 and 2023. This sustained demand for tech expertise in banking reflects the industry's ongoing digital transformation, which provides technologists with opportunities to develop patentable innovations. Generative AI has the potential to create substantial value across the banking sector, including wholesale and retail segments. The fast-emerging technology is projected to contribute an additional $200 billion to $340 billion in value to the industry, according to McKinsey research. In addition to AI, financial institutions are also investing heavily in areas such as blockchain and cybersecurity, necessitating a continuous pipeline of specialized talent. In 2024, the tech industry faced a challenging landscape, with more than 525 companies cutting approximately 150,000 positions, according to Layoffs.fyi. This widespread reduction in headcount is further exacerbated by the growing risk of conventional tech roles becoming outdated or diminished due to the advancement of AI. The Bay Area, which is the leading tech hub for major corporations and startups, experienced a significant wave of job cuts in its technology sector during the second quarter of this year, due to changing market conditions and economic pressures. Tech companies disclosed intentions to cut over 7,000 positions in the region, as reported by Mercury News. The 7,062 job losses marked the most substantial quarterly reduction since the first quarter of 2023, when the industry eliminated more than 10,000 roles in what was previously thought to be the height of tech layoffs. The latest national employment data shows limited movement in the tech workforce. According to the November jobs report from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the tech unemployment rate slightly decreased to 2.5%, matching the lowest level recorded in 2024. However, employment in the tech sector remained largely unchanged, with a marginal decline of 1,636 jobs during the month, an analysis by CompTIA, an organization specializing in IT certification and training, revealed. In stark contrast, emerging professionals view the financial sector as the most promising career path in the current economic landscape. A 2024 Global Graduate Outlook Survey by CFA Institute, a not-for-profit organization that provides finance education, found that 30% of respondents identified financial services as the sector they have the most confidence in, marking a six percentage point increase from 2023 and maintaining its top ranking for the second consecutive year. As automation advances, the demand for tech workers skilled in machine learning, natural language processing and large language models is growing. Consequently, employers are placing a greater emphasis on AI skills in their recruitment strategies. Recent EY research indicated a surge in corporate AI investments, with widespread adoption across surveyed companies, as 95% of senior leaders report ongoing AI investments. Notably, there's a substantial increase in high-value AI commitments, with the percentage of companies planning to invest $10 million or more in AI expected to nearly double from 16% to 30% in the coming year. Goldman Sachs projects that global AI investments will approach $200 billion by 2025. Capital One and Bank of America secured positions among the top 15 companies obtaining AI-related utility patents, joining prominent technology firms such as Toyota, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and IBM, according to patent consulting firm Harrity & Harrity. Moreover, Citigroup expanded its workforce by adding 8,000 technologists between 2022 and 2023. The bank had previously announced its intention to aggressively hire around 2,500 tech professionals in 2020, including coders, engineers and data analysts, to enhance its trading and investment banking divisions. Additionally, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Well Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are deploying AI and machine learning within its businesses. One Community. Many Voices.

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER) stands against other stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the outlook for the stock market following a year of strong gains, cautioning that investors’ overly optimistic expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead to trouble. As the year draws to a close, brokerages are releasing their official market predictions for 2025, and so far, they are almost universally positive. He said that this optimism is understandable given the strong earnings season and the significant stock market rally following the election. Cramer noted that many investors are betting that a business-friendly administration will continue to drive better returns. “See, after all these gains, you gotta get a little squeamish, don’t you? Unless something drastic happens in the next few weeks, we’re in line for our second straight year of 20% plus returns for the S&P 500. First time that’s happened since 1999, ooh, not the best precedent. Plus, the market’s gotten really expensive by historical standards.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch Cramer said that his main worry is that Wall Street may have gotten ahead of itself, with too many investors expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than are realistically likely. He highlighted the unusual situation that has unfolded since the Fed’s surprise double rate cut in September. While short-term interest rates have come down, long-term rates set by the bond market have actually risen, creating a stark contrast. He remarked: “The market’s betting on a December rate cut. Anything that derails that will be bad news for the averages.” When looking ahead to 2025, Cramer noted a significant lack of consensus about future rate cuts. He pointed to Fed funds futures for December 2025, which show a wide range of predicted outcomes. Investors are betting on anywhere from zero to eight rate cuts by then, with the most likely scenario being three cuts by the end of 2025. Cramer explained that while he thinks three rate cuts sound reasonable, it also suggests that roughly 41% of the market is anticipating too many cuts over the next year, a scenario that could disappoint many money managers. “So here’s the bottom line: Given all the success we’ve had in this market, we need to guard against complacency and that’s why I’m flagging my biggest worry that the market might be getting too aggressive with its expectations for rate cuts over the next year.” For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8 During the lightning round, when a viewer asked Cramer about Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER), he said that it is possibly time to take some profit. “Well, it finally seems to have its day, but this weekend, there’s some big presentations at the thing called ASH… They’re going to make presentations, a lot of other companies, and it better be good after that run and I can’t be assured that it is good. Maybe it’s a little profit-taking time.” Omeros (NASDAQ:OMER) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for immunologic diseases, cancers, and addictive disorders, with key products in trials for various conditions. It should be noted that over the first nine months of 2024, the company’s net loss amounted to $125.5 million, or $2.15 per share, which is a deeper loss compared to the net loss of $108.8 million, or $1.73 per share, for the same period in the previous year. As of September 30, 2024, the company had $123.2 million in cash and short-term investments, marking a decrease of $48.7 million from the end of 2023. These funds are being used for ongoing operations and debt obligations. The company recently reported some good news as it made a significant announcement regarding its investigational drug zaltenibart (OMS906. It has received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This designation is for the drug’s potential use in treating complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a rare and serious kidney disorder that primarily affects children and young adults. Additionally, Omeros’ (NASDAQ:OMER) zaltenibart is being developed for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), another rare disease, for which it has already received orphan drug designation from the FDA. The market for PNH treatments is anticipated to grow substantially, from $3.9 billion in 2023 to $10.1 billion by 2032, reflecting the increasing demand for effective therapies for these complex conditions. Overall, OMER ranks 11th on our list of stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight. While we acknowledge the potential of OMER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:STRL), Cramer said: “This stock’s up 120%. Now I will tell you, Sterling infrastructure… It is living off, I think, a lot of the federal money that’s been spent. So, I don’t want to get greedy… Take some off the table and let the rest run.” Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) provides a range of services, including site development for e-commerce, data centers, and power generation, infrastructure projects for transportation systems, and concrete foundations and plumbing services for residential and commercial buildings. It works with federal, state, and municipal governments, particularly state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other regional authorities overseeing airports, ports, water systems, and railroads. Four state DOTs accounted for half of the segment’s revenue in 2023, a slight increase from 44% in 2022 and 42% in 2021. In the third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted that the company is currently in the second half of the federal funding cycle for transportation projects. They mentioned that the company has built up a backlog of over two years and continues to see strong activity in the sector. Management believes that the company is positioned in a market environment that supports sustained growth above historical levels, assuming margins hold steady or improve. In addition to its transportation work, Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) continues to benefit from the growing demand for hyperscale data center development. Earlier this year, its subsidiary, Plateau Excavation, was awarded a data center project in the southeastern U.S., valued at approximately $100 million. The project includes 280 acres of site work, with 125,000 linear feet of underground infrastructure installation.

Title: Microsoft Shareholders Vote Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal

Time Published: 2024-12-10T17:04:10Z
Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT) doesn't appear to be adding its name anytime soon to the list of corporate entities holding bitcoin (BTC) after its shareholders voted against a proposal that would have directed the board of directors to study such a move. Titled "Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin," the proposal was put forward by the National Center for Public Policy Research. The think tank group suggested that Microsoft should consider diversifying 1% of its total assets into bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. According to the latest data by Bloomberg, Microsoft holds $78.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The board last month had urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. The preliminary vote result was announced minutes ago at the company's annual meeting. Shares of MSFT were trading for $446 in the minutes after the decision was announced, roughly flat for the day. Already under pressure on Tuesday, bitcoin prices fell a bit more following the news, now lower by 4% over the past 24 hours to $95,700. A 3-minute presentation by Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has seen its stock price surge as much as 2,500% since adding bitcoin to the company’s treasury strategy more than four years ago, was meant to convince shareholders otherwise. Saylor argued that Microsoft had surrendered $200 billion in capital over the past five years by issuing dividends and stock buybacks instead of purchasing bitcoin. From the beginning, though, Microsoft's board had concerns over bitcoin due to the inherent volatility of the asset. The company, according to the board, prioritizes stable and predictable investments to mitigate as much risk as possible.

Title: Sonos Arc Ultra review: don’t call it a comeback (yet)
URL: https://www.theverge.com/24315195/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-more-bass
Time Published: 2024-12-10T17:01:29Z
Full Content:
By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Sonos really needed a great product right now. 2024 will be remembered as the year that Sonos nearly torpedoed its brand with the haphazard, premature rollout of an overhauled mobile app. This led to an unprecedented outcry from loyal customers who faced myriad bugs, diminished system performance, and other issues. Many called for CEO Patrick Spence to step down. That didn’t happen, but Sonos has spent the majority of this year on the back foot with apologies, turnaround plans, and assurances that a setback of this magnitude will never happen again. It’s under these undesirable circumstances that Sonos has released the briefly delayed Arc Ultra soundbar. The $999 Ultra is designed to improve on what was already a very capable Dolby Atmos soundbar. After many hours testing the Ultra, I can say it resoundingly succeeds. Software missteps aside, Sonos can still deliver on hardware. The Ultra is a notable improvement in basically every regard, and a worthwhile upgrade — if you’re ready to trust Sonos again. The original Arc arrived during a high point for the company that its executives must desperately miss, back when demand for its products was soaring amid the covid-19 pandemic. The Arc was a strong performer that delivered an impressive level of immersion from a single soundbar, though some customers experienced a loud popping sound caused by a bug that took the company far too long to fix. The Arc had other weaknesses, with bass response at the top of that list. Unless you paired the Arc with a Sub (or the Sub Mini that came later), the soundbar didn’t have enough low-end bite to make you feel the booms and reverberating explosions in Hollywood blockbusters. It’s a downside shared by many soundbars and an inevitable tradeoff that comes with the form factor. In 2022, Sonos spent $100 million to try and overcome that by acquiring a small company called Mayht Holding, which had developed a “revolutionary approach to audio transducers” that allowed them to be smaller and lighter without compromising on sound. The Arc Ultra is the first time we’re seeing that technology in an actual product. It’s being used for a new “SoundMotion” woofer built into the soundbar that produces twice as much bass as the original Arc. It’s a cool-looking thing, and here’s a TL;DR on how it works from Sonos’ press kit: - Distributed lightweight motors displace more air for added bass. - Aerospace-grade aluminium ribs connect the motors for combined power, allowing a smaller enclosure. - Four pairs of opposing magnets power four voice coils for bigger sound in a smaller enclosure. - Reinforced force-cancelling cones minimize vibration for clearer sound. This compact, relatively flat woofer design freed up enough space for Sonos to cram even more drivers (14 in total) inside the Arc Ultra. The original Arc had 11. Such an arsenal of speakers is good enough for the Ultra to deliver a 9.1.4 surround experience. That’s what Sonos’ marketing claims, at least. Don’t get hung up on the numbers; several of those are virtualized phantom channels, and this is still a soundbar at the end of the day. What’s objectively true is that the Arc Ultra produces a soundstage that’s noticeably wider and more dynamic than its predecessor. And it does so in a cylindrical enclosure that’s similar in size and overall design to the original, though this one’s a bit shorter — nice if your TV is on a stand like mine — and slightly longer. The touch controls have been relocated to an upward-facing panel at the rear of the soundbar, with the Arc Ultra now sharing the same button layout as the Era 100 / 300 and Move 2. Hands-free voice commands also remain, though Google Assistant is no longer available. You can use Amazon Alexa, Sonos Voice Control, or both simultaneously. One welcome upgrade is a Trueplay feature called Quick Tune. Like other recent Sonos speakers, the Ultra can use its built-in microphones to tune itself for your environment — without requiring the manual Trueplay process of moving around the room while waving your iPhone around. This means Android users can finally take advantage of Trueplay, or at least this faster version of it, which wasn’t possible on the first Arc. iPhone owners still have the option of doing a more thorough tuning like before. I didn’t notice a meaningful difference between the two, but you might, depending on your room layout. Bluetooth audio playback is also supported on the Ultra after being MIA on the original Arc. There’s a pairing button at the back of the soundbar beside the ethernet jack and microphone mute switch. AirPlay 2 is still on board, and the Ultra makes the jump to Wi-Fi 6 for more dependable wireless performance. Something Sonos hasn’t addressed is the lack of HDMI passthrough. Other premium soundbars let you plug in a game console or disc player without sacrificing another HDMI port on your TV, but Sonos clearly favors simplicity here. I tested the Arc Ultra in three different setups: first by itself; then with the also-new Sub 4 ($799); and lastly with the Sub 4 and a pair of Era 300 speakers as rear surrounds. Even on its own, the improvements over the original Arc are obvious and plentiful. The Sound Motion woofer delivers on its promise, giving the soundbar more oomph and a thicker low end that will likely be more than enough if you’ve got a small to medium-sized living room or are living in an apartment with people below you. Putting bass aside, the Ultra simply has greater clarity, dimensionality, and depth than the Arc. The height effects are more convincing, and everything sounds more expansive without getting thin or too dispersed. I was as captivated by The Wild Robot at home as I was seeing it at an Alamo theater. The Ultra beats out the Arc for music, too. Whether it’s Atmos tracks like Kacey Musgraves’ “Sway” or regular stereo, Sonos’ Sound Motion tech and the added drivers make a difference. I still do most of my music listening elsewhere given the choice, but for relaxing on the couch, this does the trick. Dialogue clarity is also fantastic and the other major reason to consider upgrading from the Arc. Even without enabling the speech enhancement feature, which now has three levels to choose between, the center channel is more impactful. I could clearly hear Christian Bale’s voice over the roar of engines in Ford v Ferrari. Guy Ritchie’s Snatch is an old favorite (and good test for dialogue intelligibility), and it posed no problems for the Arc Ultra. Bringing in the Sub 4 levels up the bass from good to stellar. This configuration also allows the soundbar to concentrate on treble and midrange frequencies, while the dedicated subwoofer takes care of rumbling bass. And yes, if you throw in the pair of Era 300 speakers, you get the full Sonos Dolby Atmos experience. It’s blissful and can be downright mesmerizing, which is what I’d hope for from a bundle that costs over $2,500. If you’re interested in digging into frequency response charts, check out Andrew Robinson’s great YouTube review. Whether used solo or as a package, Sonos has a winner on its hands that can outshine the best from Samsung and other brands. But none of that matters if you can’t rely on the software that controls everything. So, what about the beleaguered new app? My experience during this review was surprisingly headache-free. None of my speakers randomly vanished from the system, and controlling the Arc Ultra was responsive and worked as intended. Adding the Sub and surrounds went off without a hitch. It was all very encouraging, but I fully understand that some people are still having a frustrating time with the app. And new problems continue to arise: early on, there was a Trueplay bug with the Arc Ultra that nerfed bass response. That’s since been resolved, but Sonos needs to keep the performance enhancements and bug fixes coming into the new year and well beyond. Just recently, I’ve seen numerous complaints about a bug that’s badly hampering the Era 300’s surround sound performance — and this affects owners of the original Arc, too. Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. To use the Sonos Arc Ultra, you must agree to: Using Amazon’s Alexa assistant also means agreeing to Amazon’s Alexa terms of use. Final tally: one mandatory agreement and one or more optional agreements. The Arc Ultra is an excellent product and a crucial step in the right direction. It’s a significant improvement over the original and easily in contention for the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy. But this is only one step, and whatever comes next will be the true indication of just where Sonos is headed. If the rumors of a video streaming box are true, Patrick Spence and Co. better have a compelling justification for moving beyond Sonos’ core audio business. The damage from the app episode will be lasting, and it has already led to layoffs and rendered the Ace headphones all but forgotten in less than a year. After going through this ordeal, I wouldn’t blame anyone for holding off on the Arc Ultra until Sonos proves it’s capable of making good decisions again. The company isn’t out of the woods yet. Not even close. But it still knows how to make a damn good speaker, so there’s hope.

Title: The Omnicom-IPG megamerger signals a new era for the ad industry

Hello. Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate, has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday and initially faced local gun and forgery charges. Our team has been covering this developing story — keep up with our coverage here. In today's newsletter, the $13 billion Omnicom-IPG megamerger reflects a new era as Big Tech and AI upend the ad industry. What's on deck: But first, a new ad-venture. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's already been a big week for the ad industry. Omnicom Group said it had reached an agreement to acquire Interpublic Group, a merger worth more than $30 billion that would create the world's largest ad conglomerate. Across the pond at Paris-based Publicis Groupe, the party hats might be staying in the drawer. Just last week, Publicis recruited Snoop Dogg for a video to help celebrate the firm usurping London's WPP to become the world's largest ad holding company. But it's not just about being No. 1. For ad industry insiders, the proposed takeover reflects an ad sector under threat from Big Tech and AI, writes Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly. By creating a larger company, Omnicom-IPG will have a bigger base to deploy data and technology, which could give it leverage to secure beneficial and exclusive deals with partners such as cloud providers. Keep in mind, however, that in the short term mergers can be highly disruptive. Concerned clients. Bruised egos. Job cuts. Integrating two companies with 100,000 people combined, dozens of different agency brands, and hundreds of offices across the globe will not be a simple task. There will likely be synergies — including job cuts. "It will be harder to climb the career ladder. Superstar creators and creatives will also be in demand, as well as good strategists, in all disciplines. But, lots of other roles will become diminished," Simon Francis, who leads the marketing consultancy Flock Associates, told BI. However, as Lara highlights, that could create opportunities for smaller agencies, especially as the merged company works its way through the disruption caused by integration, egos being knocked out of joint (it wouldn't be the first time), and potential client conflicts where the new entity suddenly works with two or more fierce rivals in the same sector. "From an M&A perspective, it's only going to add fuel to the fire." That's according to William Ritchie, founding and managing director of advisor firm WY Partners. "I'd expect there is going to be more competition for the best assets and more focus on building a streamlined data and tech-first offering which can compete," he told BI. Private equity has been circling the ad industry, too. Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone have shown interest in media and entertainment. Industry insiders have speculated for months that WPP could be taken private — or at least some parts of it could be. The Insider Today team: Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire co-founder, had his net worth cut by $15 billion Tuesday as the company’s stock paced its worst loss in nearly a year, after a recent earnings report that fell short of estimates, though analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm. Oracle’s shares fell by more than 7% to below $177 as of around 11:40 a.m. EST, the biggest plunge for the stock since Dec. 12, 2023. The value of Ellison’s roughly 42% stake in Oracle—totaling more than 1.1 billion shares—decreased from $218.2 billion at Monday’s close to $203 billion Tuesday. On Monday, Oracle reported $14.06 billion in second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47, both of which fell just below analyst projections of $14.1 billion and $1.48 per share, respectively, according to FactSet. Despite missing estimates, analysts indicated Oracle’s cloud business will likely fuel its growth: Of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet, none lowered their stock price target for Oracle and 14 raised their projections, including some that have the stock returning close to its record intraday high of $198 set on Monday. Revenue from Oracle’s cloud services rose 12% year-over-year to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue, the company said. Investment firm D.A. Davidson said in a note Tuesday that Oracles’ cloud infrastructure “remains heightened” as demand for AI-based computing continues to grow.

Ellison is the world’s third-richest person with an estimated net worth of $220 billion, which decreased by about 6% on Tuesday. Oracle’s chairman ranks behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, currently the second-wealthiest in the world, though the two have traded ranks multiple times in recent months. Bezos’ fortune increased by nearly 1% ($2.4 billion) to $242.3 billion Tuesday as Amazon shares rose slightly. 83%. That’s how much Oracle’s shares increased this year as of Monday’s share price of $190.45. Oracle, a database software firm co-founded by Ellison, has succeeded this year alongside a rising demand for AI-based technology. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank analysts said Oracle achieved a “triple crown” after reaching partnerships with cloud computing giants Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Oracle also recently signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media firm to use Oracle’s cloud infrastructure to help with projects related to Meta’s Llama language models. Oracle raised its guidance for its 2026 fiscal year in September, saying the company expects to generate about $66 billion in revenue shortly after announcing the company would take orders for “computing clusters” built with Nvidia’s GPUS. The product was touted by Oracle as the “largest AI supercomputer in the cloud.” One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Dan Niles on Nvidia (NVDA): People Just Want to Believe ‘Santa Claus Rally’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks this Week. Paul Hickey, Bespoke Investment Group co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that despite the market gains still concentrated in a few names, he’s bullish short and long term because of AI. “The longer term play is the AI trade. This is an AI bull market. Every bull market has a theme, and ChatGPT was to AI what Netscape and AOL were to the internet.” Hickey also mentioned the possible scenario where market gains would start to broaden out. “ChatGPT didn’t invent AI; it made it tangible for consumers and businesses, just like Netscape with the internet. It caused, you know, made it a lot more practical on the part of businesses and the consumer. So I think in that respect, there’s a lot more investment to go, and we’ve seen the infrastructure stocks in AI benefit. But even just last week, some of these software names—and we’re going to slowly start to see that broaden out to the rest of the economy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Commenting on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) results last month, Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said that when Nvidia said in its call that the demand would surpass supplies for the next “several quarters,” it set the bar lower for those who “believe the dreams.” “They just reset the bar lower. Things are going to accelerate as you go into next year, and so, depending, you’re in a really great seasonal time of year for stocks. People just want to believe in the Santa Claus rally.” Niles then made his case for the expected slowdown and reality check for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the future: “You’re going to, at some point next year, run into an issue where you’ll need to see a return on investment for the money you’re putting in. Think about Microsoft—they cut estimates after the June quarter report and again after the September quarter report. At their Ignite conference, they even mentioned hitting a wall, potentially with scaling loss. Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia’s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers — which account for 50% of its revenue — are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia’s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins. Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The fund held an underweight position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA’s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA’s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA’s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company’s revenue, which presents added risk.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks this Week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY?

The logo of e-commerce company Ebay is pictured at an exhibition booth for vehicle parts at the ... [+] Essen Motor Show in Essen, western Germany on December 4, 2024. (Photo by Ina FASSBENDER / AFP) (Photo by INA FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images) We believe that the internet retail company eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is currently a better pick over the apparel retail company, Lululemon stock. Although these companies are from different industries, they belong to the consumer cyclical sector and share a similar revenue base of around $10 billion. EBAY stock trades at 3.2x trailing revenues, versus 5.0x for LULU. We think this gap in valuation will narrow in favor of EBAY in the coming years. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think EBAY will outperform LULU in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. Separately, check out What’s Behind The 80% Rise In META Stock? EBAY stock has seen gains of 45% from levels of $45 in early January 2021 to around $65 now, vs. an increase of about 15% for LULU stock from $350 to $405. This compares with 60% gains for the broader S&P 500 index over this four-year period. However, the increase in these stocks has been far from consistent. Returns for EBAY stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 49% so far in 2024, while that for LULU stock were 12%, -18%, 60%, and -22%, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 28% so far this year — indicating that EBAY underperformed the S&P in 2022 and 2023, and LULU underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2024. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including PG, and AMZN, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 the last 3 years over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. eBay has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 5% from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.3 billion now. On the other hand, Lululemon’s average revenue growth rate of 30% from $4.4 billion in fiscal 2021 (fiscal ends in January) to $10.2 billion now has been comparatively much faster. eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher gross merchandise volume and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Lululemon’s revenue growth lately has been driven by strong growth in China and international markets. For perspective, China sales were up a whopping 67% y-o-y in 2023, and another 39% so far this year. China now accounts for 13% of the company’s total sales, versus 8% in 2021. However, the company’s largest market – the Americas region – is seeing tepid growth lately, up just 2% for the nine-month period ending October 2024. This can be attributed to a change in consumer spending trends and rising competition. Looking forward, we expect Lululemon to see a high-single-digit average growth rate in the coming years, led by continued growth in China, versus a low single-digit rate for eBay. eBay’s operating margin fell from 29.6% in 2020 to 19.2% in 2023, while Lululemon’s operating margin expanded from 19.3% in fiscal 2021 to 22.9% in fiscal 2024. If we look at the last twelve-month period, Lululemon’s operating margin of 23.3% fares better than 21.3% for eBay. Lululemon’s profitability is superior compared to some of its peers, including Nike, with operating profit margin of 11.8% and 9.2% for On Holding. For eBay, the decline in profitability lately can be attributed to increased spending on R&D to improve its product experience. From a financial risk perspective, eBay seems to have an edge over Lululemon. Its 25% debt as a percentage of equity is slightly lower than 26% for Lululemon, while its 45% cash as a percentage of assets is much higher than 17% for the latter. This implies that eBay has a better debt position and has more cash cushion. We see that LULU has seen better revenue growth and is more profitable. On the other hand, eBay has a better financial position. Now, looking at valuation, we think EBAY is the better choice of the two. EBAY, at its current levels of $65 trades at 3.2x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 2.8x over the last three years. In comparison, LULU stock trades at 5.ox trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 6.7x over the last three years. However, for LULU, a decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the slowing sales growth from around 30% average rate in the last three years to a high single-digit expected growth rate in the next three years. The company also faced a backlash after the launch of Breezethrough leggings, with a V-shaped back seam, earlier this year. The product received negative reviews at large, and the company decided to pull the product from the market. Lululemon also faces increased competition in the athleisure market. Overall, we think LULU stock is overpriced at levels of around $400, while EBAY may offer some room for growth in the coming years, as it focuses on improving the GMV using generative AI capabilities. While EBAY may outperform LULU in the next three years, it is helpful to see how eBay’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: What’s Behind The 80% Rise In META Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/10/whats-behind-the-80-rise-in-meta-stock/

GERMANY - 2024/12/01: In this photo illustration, a Meta Platforms Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... [+] monitor. (Photo Illustration by Valera Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) is up 5% in a month, with investor optimism around the TikTok ban. A federal appeals court recently upheld a law requiring TikTok’s owner ByteDance to find a new owner for its U.S. operations, outside of China, by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. If TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., it would have been a positive for Meta, with less competition in the social media space. See how two other tech stocks compare in Salesforce vs. Oracle Stock. Even if we were to look at a slightly longer term, META stock has outperformed, with 83% returns since early 2022 — rising from levels of $335 then to around $620 now — vs. an increase of 28% for the broader S&P 500 index over this period. This 83% growth can be attributed to: Let’s dive deeper into these factors. Separately, check out our take on EBAY – Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY? Meta Platforms is the world’s most popular social network that helps people connect with family and friends. The company makes money primarily through advertising, which it provides to advertisers by targeting specific demographics based on information posted by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms’ revenue has risen 32.5% from $118 billion in 2021 to $156 billion for the last twelve month period. This can be attributed to rising ad impressions as well as an increase in the average price per ad. Also, Meta’s family daily active people have risen 17% from 2.82 billion in 2021 to 3.29 billion now. Most of the company’s revenue comes from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only has the company’s sales risen in the last three years, its net income margin has expanded from 33.4% in 2021 to 35.6% now. Meta’s shares outstanding also declined by 8% over this period, thanks to the $122 billion the company spent on share repurchases. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion and fewer shares resulted in the company’s bottom line of $21.17 now, up 54% from $13.77 in 2021. Investors have rewarded Meta stock lately, as the rise in both ad impressions and average price per ad bodes well for the company’s sales. Furthermore, the company’s AI push is expected to help it generate higher advertising revenues, with an increase in user engagement and more effective targeting. Furthermore, what may go well for Meta is the TikTok ban in the U.S. But, ByteDance has recently filed an emergency motion with an appeals court seeking a temporary block on the ban from taking effect. [1] Meta stock declined nearly 2% after the news report of TikTok filing an emergency motion emerged. At its current levels of $615, META stock is up a solid 74% this year. However, the increase in META stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think META is fully valued now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, slightly below the current market price. META stock is now trading at 29x trailing earnings of $21.17 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. Although a slight rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately, investors should take into account the risks. It’s still unclear how significant a boost AI can be for the company’s earnings growth, which makes the continued aggressive investments in AI a slight risk. While META stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see how Meta Platform’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: This mid-range gaming laptop feels like the forgotten middle child, and isn't difficult to understand why
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/lenovo/lenovo-legion-5i-gen-9-review
Time Published: 2024-12-10T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) feels extremely familiar to other mid-range Legion laptops of the last few years in that it's unapologetically 'chonky,' but still delivers reliably excellent gaming performance in a reassuringly sturdy chassis. It certainly doesn't wow outside of being a gaming laptop, but more odd is how forgotten this laptop feels in the current Legion lineup (and how surprisingly difficult it was to track down where you can buy one). Sturdy, practical design with healthy port selection Excellent gaming performance and thermal management Comfortable and responsive keyboard Attractive pricing, especially with frequent sales Feels oddly placed between the Legion Slim 5i and Legion Pro 5i laptops Definitely not suited for anything outside gaming and graphically intensive work Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. The Lenovo Legion line of gaming hardware and accessories has continually expanded over the years to the point where Lenovo even created the new LOQ brand specifically for its budget gaming devices. • Pricing & specs• Design & build quality• Display quality• Performance & thermals• Battery experience• Keyboard & everything else• Competition• Score card & final thoughts That's been great for giving customers choices, and Lenovo has become a very reliable recommendation for those seeking a straightforward, dependable gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5 line dominates the mid-range category, and the Legion 5i (Gen 9) I've been testing sits in the middle of that family. It's a familiar experience with a practical and hefty design, excellent gaming performance, and reasonable pricing. It'd be an easy recommendation, except it awkwardly sits between the longer-lasting Legion Slim 5i and the more powerful Legion Pro 5i like the neglected middle child — and if you do some shopping, you'll notice that Lenovo and retailers alike are far more likely to recommend the Slim and Pro variants to you than this one — even if I'd sooner suggest this laptop before its Pro big sibling. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. • Price: ~$1,609.99-$1,949.99 at Lenovo• Display: 16-inch IPS LCD, 16:10 aspect ratio, QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600) resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 350nits max brightness, anti-glare coating, non-touch, Dolby Vision HDR support, NVIDIA G-SYNC support• CPU: Intel Core i9-14900HX (24 cores, 32 threads, up to 5.8GHz)• GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8GB DDR6)• NPU: None (Lenovo LA1 chip for Lenovo AI Engine+ support)• RAM: 32GB DDR5 @ 5,600MHz (2x 16GB, SODIMM)• Storage: 1TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 4x4 SSD• Battery: 80Whr, Rapid Charge Pro support w/ 230W adapter• Dimensions: 359.7 x 262.3 x 19.7-25.2mm (14.16 x 10.33 x 0.78-0.99in)• Weight: 2.36kg (5.2lbs) Pricing and availability for the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) are odd, to say the least. Most retailers you'd first go to for all your laptop buying needs aren't likely to offer this laptop at all (Best Buy selling both the Slim and Pro variants is a great example of this), and even Lenovo sells few pre-configured models and somewhat limits your choices in its custom configurator. The only shop I could find my exact review configuration was Costco, of all places. That's alright, though, because the Intel Core i9 inside my unit seems a little overkill when paired with the rest of the internals. The most affordable Legion 5i (Gen 9) straight from the source is $1,120.99 at Lenovo (at least at the time of writing), which gets you a Core i7-14650HX, RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD in a well-specced, balanced mid-range gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5i custom configurator starts from $1,239.99 at Lenovo at the time of writing, giving you more options but costing you a little more across the board. Either way, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) consistently costs less than the Legion Pro 5i, with the only differences being a gently more compact design, barely different port selection, and slightly worse overall performance. In the box, you'll find the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9), a proprietary 230W DC charger and adapter, a 3-month subscription for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a replaceable rear vent plate with a blue accent color (versus the default flat grey). Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) — Buy now at Lenovo ($1,120.99 at time of writing) This variant of the Lenovo Legion 5i is powered by an Intel Core i7-14650HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. At the time of this review Lenovo lists this with a ridiculous retail price of $1,789.99, but the discounted $1,120.99 is an excellent price for this laptop. 👉See at: Lenovo.com If you've seen one Lenovo Legion laptop in the last few years, you've essentially seen them all. Sure, there have been refinements and improvements made over the years, but Legion devices have remained remarkably consistent over time. The Legion 5i is like the Legion Pro 5i and Legion Slim 5i — it makes no attempt at being the thinnest or lightest gaming laptop. This is just a really practical design that feels incredibly durable and reliable. The Legion 5i is actually thinner (~25.2 vs. ~26.8mm) and lighter (2.36 vs. 2.5kg) than the Legion Pro 5i and puts all of its vents on the rear and bottom. This means your ports are more spread out, but overall, it's a very similar configuration. You get one USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with 140W Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, a second USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort 1.4, three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports (one is always on), and HDMI 2.1 port that supports up to 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 60Hz, an RJ45 Ethernet port, a microSD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. For comparison, the Legion Pro 5i loses the microSD card reader but gains a fourth USB Type-A port. Finally, there's the familiar 230W DC charging port, which supports up to 300W for more powerful configurations. The Lenovo Legion 5i feels familiar once again when you look at its display. It's the same panel across the entire Legion 5 lineup, actually (with the exception of an optional 240Hz configuration), meaning you're looking at 16 inches of QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600), 165Hz IPS LCD goodness. This display isn't likely to wow you at any point, but it's solid across the board and offers reliable, smooth performance when gaming. 99% of the sRGB and 78% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts means you shouldn't rely on this display for any creative work, but this display is consistent. It gets decently bright, its contrast ratios are good for an IPS LCD panel, and its white balance, while warm, is level across all brightness levels. Dolby Vision HDR support is also technically here, but this isn't a screen I'd rely on to consume high-quality HDR content. When gaming, this display is smooth and responsive, with NVIDIA G-SYNC support putting a halt to potential screen tearing. Performance is where you'll most wonder if you really need to spring for the more expensive Lenovo Legion Pro 5i, as the Legion 5i (Gen 9) boasts many of the same configuration options and is able to perform admirably with that hardware. Its only real flaw is that these fans are extremely loud, enough that the speakers aren't quite enough to drown them out. You'll want a headset for gaming. With the same CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, and display options, it's hard at first glance to see the difference between the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) and its more expensive Pro sibling. Really, it comes down to the Pro 5i having more thermal headroom due to its beefier chassis and being able to put a little more wattage into its components. On paper, this means the Legion Pro 5i is the more powerful laptop, and this is reflected in benchmarks. That doesn't make the Legion 5i slow, though. This laptop kept up with more expensive machines well, and in real-world performance and gaming, you're not liable to see much of a difference between the Legion 5i and the thicker, heavier Legion Pro 5i, including in gaming. Achieving stable 60 frames-per-second in most PC games at high settings is very reasonable with the Legion Pro 5i, and if you lower the resolution to 1080p (which will still look great on a 16-inch display), you can take better advantage of that 165Hz refresh rate. I also stress tested the Legion 5i's thermal management with 25 consecutive loops of 3DMark's Time Spy benchmark, and a 99.6% framerate stability proves this laptop's capable cooling system. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) carries the same 80Whr battery cell as the Legion Pro 5i and Slim 5i, and its endurance sits in between the two. Lower wattage likely contributes to the Legion 5i outlasting its Pro sibling, but it can't compete with the efficiency of the AMD-powered Slim 5i, which is one of the longest-lasting Legion laptops. In Procyon's One Hour Battery Consumption tests, the Legion 5i drained 22% while simulating a standard Microsoft Office workload and 24% when looping an HD video at 50% volume. Around 3-4 hours of regular usage isn't unreasonable with the Legion 5i, but this is still far from a battery champion and not a laptop I'd recommend for mobile work. Once again, the Legion 5i is a familiar tale here. Wholly focused on its role as a gaming laptop, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) simply isn't exciting or interesting in a lot of ways. The front-facing camera, microphones, and touchpad are all secondary on a gaming laptop, so they clearly didn't get much investment. The dual stereo speakers are also reminiscent of the "average" Windows laptop of a few years ago in that they're fine for YouTube videos or video calls, but you won't want to do much else with them. One feature a gaming laptop can't neglect is the keyboard, though, and Lenovo rarely misses here. The Legion 5i shares a keyboard with its siblings, this time with four-zone RGB lighting and a condensed tenkey number pad. It's a very solid keyboard with a comfortable and responsive action, excellent layout, full-sized arrow keys, and intelligent shortcuts and functions. I really can't complain here. As usual, there's no Windows Hello biometric authentication, but I'm not really docking the Legion 5i points for that. This is a mid-range gaming laptop, I don't expect it. I do expect excellent wireless performance, though, and the Legion 5i fares just fine on this front with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support. If you want a more stable connection, you can always use the Ethernet port. It shouldn't surprise you if you've read this review up until this point, but the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) that we've reviewed is arguably this laptop's biggest competitor. It's not because the Legion Pro 5i is necessarily better; it's more powerful, but it's also bigger, heavier, and more expensive. It's largely because the Legion Pro 5i is more available, and unless you can find a Legion 5i configuration in stock and on sale for less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, then the Legion Pro 5i may end up the easier choice. You can also consider the Lenovo Legion Slim 5i (Gen 9). We haven't reviewed this laptop, but it's very similar in size and weight to the Legion 5i but with a tweaked design and an AMD CPU that focuses more on efficiency than raw power. This is the Legion 5 to choose if you want a pure gaming laptop that can also fare okay away from the charger for a few hours. As far as this price range is concerned, though, Lenovo's Legion line is going to be one of the more attractive options, and for good reason. ✅You want a focused, no-fuss gaming laptop on a budget The Lenovo Legion 5i is designed for one thing and one thing only: to game. Sure, it's a full-blown Windows laptop and can do all the normal PC things, too, but it's clearly built for those who aren't too concerned about that (and want to save some money on a new rig). ✅You can find it on sale for less than the Legion Pro 5i The Legion 5i should cost less than the Legion Pro 5i, but its spotty availability and odd pricing don't guarantee it. If you can find the Legion 5i in the configuration you want for a good bit less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, the Legion 5i will end up being the better laptop for most people. ❌You want a gaming laptop you can also take on the go Lenovo Legion laptops aren't known for being particularly portable or efficient, and the Legion 5i is no exception. This is a beefy laptop with a short-lived battery. Those who want a more mobile machine that can still game are better off looking at something like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus line (you'll be paying more, though). The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a bit of an odd laptop. To be frank, it would be the most obvious recommendation of Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop lineup between the Legion Slim 5i (which isn't really slim at all) and the Legion Pro 5i (which barely feels "pro"), if it weren't for it being oddly... Hard to find. • Indiana Jones for Xbox• Razer Freyja cushion• iBuyPower Slate desktop• Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Lenovo's habit of overpricing its devices at retail (only to frequently discount them soon after launch) returns here, but the Legion 5i also suffers from seemingly lower visibility and availability than the more expensive Legion Pro 5i. That laptop is just as good, and you're basically gaining more weight and size in exchange for slightly better performance and cooling, but it's also usually a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. If you can find the Lenovo Legion 5i at a discounted price that settles it below where you can find the equivalent Legion 5i Pro, I honestly suggest saving that money and getting this laptop instead. It's a gaming laptop through and through and won't win any awards outside of playing your favorite PC games, but the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a good gaming laptop at an attractive price, or around $1,120.99 at Lenovo for the configuration I'd recommend. The mid-range option in Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop family, the Legion 5i (Gen 9) goes toe-to-toe with the more expensive Legion Pro 5i more often than not, while also usually costing a fair deal less. The only problem? Lenovo and retailers are far more likely to show you the Legion Pro 5i instead.

Time Published: 2024-12-10T14:52:03Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted December 10, 2024 We’ve seen this show before… Just four short years ago, stocks and crypto were ripping to new highs at a rate that alarmed many conservative investors. Due to Covid’s warping of the space-time continuum, December 2020 feels like it was just yesterday and eons ago at the same time. In case you’ve memory-holed the second half of the year of lockdowns and Covid panic, I’ll set the stage… The weather was getting colder as winter approached in late 2020. Many areas of the country were heading back into lockdown mode as Covid cases spiked. The country had almost made it through the first year of the pandemic. But a new class of stock market speculators was starting to get anxious. Stuck at their white-collar work-from-home jobs, these young bucketeers started bidding up every crazy stock and crypto they could find. Message boards, including the now-infamous “Wall Street Bets” on Reddit, attracted mainstream attention. And social media personalities like Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy live-streamed the opening bell as they bid up random tickers, hoping to land the next 10-bagger. Of course, stock market seasonality helped fuel the flames. It was the perfect time for a year-end melt up, everyone was stuck inside, and they had cash to burn. Stocks soared and the early 2021 NFT bubble began to inflate, as well as the options-fueled squeezes in meme stocks like GME. Does any of this sound familiar? The pandemic might be over. But we’re seeing history rhyme this month as a holiday market boom rivaling 2020’s Covid bubble begins to unfold. Crypto has taken center stage early with Bitcoin pushing toward a $100K breakout extension. Alt-coins are flourishing. Heck, I even joined the ranks by grabbing some DOGE as it rallied 300% off its lows to set up for what could be an even bigger breakout “Meme stocks” might not be the biggest beneficiaries of the speculation this time around – but many forgotten stocks and sectors are catching a bid and running in the current market environment. The smaller, the better! Just look at the evolution of AI mania as the year has progressed… NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) led the artificial intelligence charge during the first six months of 2024, breaking out in early January and bolting higher by more than 175% into late June. NVDA slowed down in the summer after hogging the spotlight (and most of the gains). But the big semis started to slow down in the summer. And while NVDA and the semis have picked up the pace, they aren’t the only game in town. The risk-takers have moved down the cap scale to the smaller, more speculative artificial intelligence names. These are the stocks that are ripping higher in this environment! C3.ai (AI) has jumped nearly 65% since mid-November. BBAI has gained as much as 150% over that same timeframe. And SoundHound AI Inc. (SOUN) has exploded 190% off its early November lows. AI speculations soar into melt-up season To be clear, these stocks didn’t suddenly firm up and start to run because of any fundamental changes or a surprise news event. We’re simply seeing traders rotating into the smaller, more speculative names in the industry. I don’t know what will happen with these stocks once the music stops. That goes for these AI names — or any other small, reenergized stock that’s posting a huge rally right now. But I do know how markets work — and parabolic rallies like these rarely lead to clean, sideways consolidation. There will be downside action when the rally ebbs. Some of these stocks will reset to logical new support levels and then build bases at those prices before continuing higher. Others will retrace the entire melt-up move and slowly die on the vine. There is no other way! This doesn’t mean you have to completely avoid the melt-up darlings. But you do have to adjust your expectations… One of the biggest hurdles new traders need to clear is learning how to deal with different market environments. When you first begin to develop your unique trading strategy, you will naturally want to use it consistently to book regular gains. The problem is that consistently is often replaced with constantly. Newer traders regularly force trades in less-than-ideal environments because they can’t tear themselves away from the action. They’re chasing breakouts when breakouts aren’t working, or they’re buying stocks and sectors that are out of favor for one reason or another. It’s not that they’re taking too much risk – they’re taking the wrong kind of risk. This misunderstanding can even work against traders who, on the surface, believe they are acting conservatively. If you’re a swing trader attempting to play a small move in mega-cap semiconductor plays when the smaller AI names are working, you’re taking the wrong kind of risk. And it’s costing you! As I explained last week when I detailed my uncharacteristic meme coin trade, I’m more concerned about the trades I’m not involved with right now. In melt-up conditions, the biggest risk for traders is ignoring these impressive rallies. I routinely review my trading performance, going back over the previous six to twelve months to see how I’ve fared. During this process, I’m not very interested in counting my winners. Instead, I want to review where my losses came from, what mistakes I made, and where I can improve. Again, this process isn’t about win rates or victory laps. It’s about pinpointing where I could have made different decisions, especially as it relates to emotional blind spots I might have had at the time of the trade. Next week, I’ll dig into some of the lessons learned during my 2020 Covid trading campaign. I’ll show you how a great trade doesn’t always yield ideal results, and reveal what you can do to maximize your melt-up gains. Stay tuned…

Title: Lisa Su

Lisa Su apologizes if she seems tired. It’s the day after the U.S. presidential election, and like much of the nation she was awake until the early hours, transfixed as the results came in, only tearing herself away once it became clear that Donald Trump had won. “I wanted to know,” Su explains as she takes her place at the head of a conference table in the Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “It’s relevant information.” The identity of the next President is pertinent news to most of America’s CEOs, but few more so than the leader of a top semiconductor company. Semiconductors, or chips, are the engines of our computers, phones, cars, internet services, and—increasingly—our artificial intelligence (AI) programs. The relentless rise of the chip over the past seven decades has grown economies, transformed lives, and helped cement the U.S., where most chips get their start, as the globe’s postwar hegemon. AMD is one of the world’s leading designers of the CPU chips that power both personal computers and data centers, the vast warehouses of servers that make possible the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. It’s also a top designer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the specialized chips used to create and run AI programs like ChatGPT. When you send an email, stream a movie, buy something online, or chat with an AI assistant, chances are an AMD chip is providing some of the computing power needed to make that happen. In November, a supercomputer that runs on AMD chips displaced another AMD-based machine to become the world’s most powerful. Which is thanks in large part to Su’s leadership. When she became CEO a decade ago, AMD stock was languishing around $3, its share of the data-center chip market had fallen so far that executives rounded it down to zero, and the question on everybody’s lips was how long the company had left. An engineer by training, Su spearheaded a bottom-up redesign of AMD’s products, ­repaired ­relationships with customers, and rode the AI boom to new heights. In 2022 the company’s overall value surpassed its historical rival ­Intel’s for the first time. AMD stock now trades at around $140, a nearly 50-fold increase since Su took over. This fall, Harvard Business School began teaching Su’s stewardship of AMD as a case study. “It really is one of the great turnaround stories of modern American business history,” says Chris Miller, a historian of the semiconductor industry and the author of Chip War. Purchase prints of this issue's covers here in the TIME Cover Store and click here to buy your copy of the Person of the Year issue For all its progress, AMD remains the semiconductor industry’s distant No. 2. As Su’s team was speeding past Intel, both companies were lapped by Nvidia, run by Su’s cousin Jensen Huang, which in two years has risen from industry also-ran to become the most valuable company in the world. Nvidia got a jump on its rivals by realizing that its chips, initially made for rendering graphics, happened to be perfectly suited for training neural networks, the programs that underpin modern AI. Of the $32 billion worth of AI data-center GPUs sold in the third quarter of 2024, ­Nvidia’s accounted for some 95%. In November, AMD announced that it would lay off 4% of its global workforce in what it framed as a restructuring to focus on the opportunities from AI. Meanwhile, big tech customers, like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, are now designing their own specialized chips for AI workloads, which could reduce their reliance on AMD products. And AMD’s continued growth relies on a host of factors outside its control: continued progress in AI; the security of Taiwan, where the vast majority of its top chips are manufactured; and the actions of a notoriously unpredictable U.S. President. Trump’s return to the White House will bring new turbulence to an industry that has barely caught its breath from a half-­decade of geopolitical showdowns, shortages, and an AI-fueled market boom. A lot rides on Su’s ability to steer the company through these obstacles. People who know her describe Su as a shrewd strategist who invests in talented people and jettisons those who aren’t pulling their weight. “I don’t believe leaders are born. I believe leaders are trained,” she tells TIME, ahead of a strategy meeting where she delivers blunt feedback to her executives and urges them to move faster and delegate more. Su, 55, holds meetings on weekends and is known among her executives for wanting to talk on morning calls about the finer points of long documents that were circulated after midnight. When prototype chips get delivered from the factory, she often personally goes down to the lab to help scrutinize them. It’s a hard-­charging style that isn’t for everyone and makes it difficult for people who don’t meet their commitments to survive at the company, according to Patrick Moorhead, a tech-industry analyst and a former AMD ­executive who left before she joined. The potential for artificial intelligence to transform science, health care, and the world of work hinges on access to a diverse supply of chips. In the brewing cold war between the U.S. and China, semiconductors are among the most vital battlegrounds. And America’s economic success—as measured by its stock market, at least—depends now more than ever on the continued growth of companies that design, produce, and utilize chips. Allies say Su is up to the task. “We couldn’t have a person better qualified for this job,” says Jerry Sanders, the company’s 88-year-old founder and its first CEO. Does she have what it takes to beat Nvidia one day? “Not a question in my mind,” he says. In October 2014, Forrest Norrod was sitting in his car at a McDonald’s drive-­through when he got a phone call from Su. Norrod had just quit his job as an executive at Dell, intending to take some time off. Su wanted to pitch him on joining AMD, where she had just been appointed CEO. While Norrod waited for his Quarter Pounder with cheese, he listened to her vision for the struggling company. By the next day, he was at AMD’s Austin headquarters, weighing the opportunity to lead its server business. Norrod had seen how the pace of innovation in the cloud-­chip industry had dropped off once AMD had allowed Intel to dominate the market, and believed that customers were paying the price. He got a sense that Su was a leader with a rare combination of traits: a technical background, business acumen, and people skills. He accepted the job. Su was born in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. at age 3, when the family immigrated so her father could attend graduate school. She grew up in New York City and discovered a love of STEM subjects at an early age, growing fascinated by the ability to write rudimentary programs on her Commodore 64 computer. She fondly recalls creating, at the science-­focused high school she attended in the Bronx, a project in which she simulated a hurricane inside a box, complete with boiling water and windows through which to watch the maelstrom. She chose to major in electrical engineering at MIT after determining that it was the most difficult option—and eventually earned her Ph.D. in the subject. It was at MIT that Su first experienced a semiconductor lab, where she was taken by the idea that such a tiny piece of hardware could carry so much mathematical firepower. She spent the first years of her career at Texas Instruments and IBM, two first-wave tech titans, which taught her about how to run a business and manage teams. “I was really lucky early in my career,” she says. “Every two years, I did a different thing.” She accepted a VP job at AMD in 2012, and by 2014 had ­ascended to CEO. “I felt like I was in training for the opportunity to do something meaningful in the semiconductor industry,” she says. “And AMD was my shot.” Su took over an indebted firm that had fired 25% of its staff, sold and leased back its Austin office, and spun off its expensive chip factories. It was a moment of change for the tech industry writ large. Smartphones and tablets were ascendant. Consumer PCs, AMD’s main market, were in decline. “It didn’t look at the time that Lisa was ­really set up for success,” says Stacy Rasgon, a chip-­industry analyst. “She was handed a tough situation.” Su’s turnaround plan had three steps: build great products, focus on customer relationships, and simplify the business. Some AMD board members wanted to pivot toward making low-power processors for phones. Su rejected that approach. “We needed to bet on what we were good at,” she says. What AMD was good at was building ­powerful processors. Su set a goal for her engineers: to build a new CPU chip that was 40% faster than the previous generation’s. And she started a team on an even more ambitious project: to explore how to develop a chip for the world’s first exascale super­computer, a machine capable of carrying out 1 quintillion operations per second. The decisions revealed a core tenet of Su’s leadership philosophy. “People are really motivated by ambitious goals,” she says. “The previous strategy of, hey, let’s just do a little bit better here and there—that’s actually less motivational.” The problem was that Su’s plans would take years to come to fruition. In the meantime, AMD was still on the ropes. “My job as a CEO was to give the engineers time to do the work,” Su says. She inked deals with console manufacturers that won AMD the revenue it needed to keep afloat. In 2016, she signed another with a consortium of ­Chinese companies, licensing some of AMD’s ­designs so they could make processors for the Chinese market. That deal brought in $293 million, though it would later come back to haunt AMD. By 2017, the company was on stronger financial footing and the new flagship chip was finally ready. Engineers had redesigned the CPU from the ground up, making use of a new architecture, which the company called “chiplets.” Until then, the chip industry had mainly etched the different parts of a processor onto one piece of silicon. AMD’s innovation was to put different circuits onto individual pieces of silicon and then fuse them all together, which made manufacturing more reliable and scalable. Engineers suggested to Su that they call the new chip “Zen,” because it was designed with a balance in mind between energy efficiency and high performance. The name stuck. Meanwhile, Intel, AMD’s main competitor, was beginning to flounder. Its new cloud processors were beset by delays. When AMD’s chips hit the market, they were the best on the block. With each new generation of Zen, AMD’s share of the cloud-­CPU market grew. Today, its share of that market is 34%. When AMD’s overall valuation surpassed Intel’s in 2022, “it felt fantastic,” Norrod says. “It’s something that I don’t think anybody in the industry would have believed was possible just a few years ago.” One recent afternoon at AMD’s Santa Clara headquarters, Su was sitting with several senior executives in the CEO’s favorite corner conference room, where the offices of both Nvidia and Intel are visible through the glass. In the meeting, Su pressed her colleagues to meet engineering milestones for the specialized chips that AMD sells for use in AI data centers. “We cannot miss a beat,” Su told them. “We have negative slack. Whatever we do organizationally, we cannot slow down.” AMD is grappling with geopolitical challenges that could reshape the semiconductor industry. Today’s chips have billions of transistors, tiny gates for managing electric current. To manufacture them requires colossal machines with hundreds of thousands of specialized parts, which fire lasers at tiny droplets of molten tin to create extreme ultra­violet light that bounces through a series of multilayered mirrors and, ultimately, etches designs onto thin wafers of silicon with atomic-level accuracy. A stray particle in the machine, a half-degree fluctuation in temperature, or a nanometer-­scale vibration could each threaten a batch of chips worth millions of dollars. The process is so complex, fragile, and expensive that only one company is currently able to manufacture at scale the most cutting-edge chips designed by the likes of AMD and Nvidia: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The industry’s most advanced chips may be conceived in Silicon Valley, but their fabrication is almost entirely outsourced to just a handful of factories on the west coast of Taiwan. Some 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait lies China, which claims the self-­governing island as its territory. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, according to U.S. intelligence assessments made public last year. And Xi has set China on a path to reduce its technological dependence on the U.S. by producing powerful chips of its own. Without Taiwanese manufacturing, the semiconductor industry would be upended and the world’s supply of advanced chips would plummet. And if Beijing's effort to become a world-leading semiconductor producer is successful, it would set up China's military and AI industry to match or outpace America’s, which many in Washington view as a national-­security threat. In this light, Su’s 2016 decision to go into business with Chinese state-backed companies looks like a misstep. Pentagon officials tried and failed to block the deal at the time, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited worries that AMD had transferred crucial know-how that could aid China’s military and domestic semiconductor ambitions. AMD denied suggestions that it had sought to evade regulatory scrutiny on the deal, saying that it had correctly briefed the Pentagon and other agencies and had received no objections, and that the Journal’s story contained “several factual errors and omissions.” At the time, there were few laws against technology transfer to China, and deeper economic integration between the two powers was viewed by many as natural. “It was a very different era,” Su says. But the music would quickly change. In 2019, the Trump Administration placed AMD’s Chinese joint venture on the “entity list” that restricts exports of critical ­technologies to foreign ­adversaries because of perceived ­security risks. In 2022, the Biden Administration passed broader export controls that made it illegal for companies like AMD and Nvidia to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese companies. Demand for specialized AI chips is so high, and their supply so constrained, that these export controls have so far had little effect on chipmakers’ bottom lines. But Trump is expected to further expand tariffs and sanctions on China, which could quickly become painful for chip companies. Some 15% of AMD’s revenue in 2023—$3.4 billion—came from the legal sale of less powerful chips to China and Hong Kong. AMD warned investors in October that its business could be adversely affected by tariffs, as well as any retaliatory measures imposed by foreign governments. If it’s any consolation for AMD’s market position, its rivals are even more exposed: in 2023, China and Hong Kong accounted for 17% of Nvidia’s revenue, and China represented 27% of Intel’s. “We want to service the entire world with our chips,” Su says. “[But] I’m certainly a believer in: we want to be the most advanced semiconductor country.” Still, AMD is incentivized to lobby against the widening of chip export controls, even if officials determine that more sanctions would be in the interests of national security. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group of U.S. chip companies including AMD, argues against export controls, and has spent more than $4.5 million since 2022 lobbying lawmakers in Washington, according to the watchdog OpenSecrets. “You have to run faster,” Su says of her view of the U.S.’s competition with China. She says her main goal with any lobbying is to help lawmakers make sure “that any desired policy has the desired effect,” adding, “We certainly want to be a good corporate citizen.” Inside a high-security laboratory beyond the dry hills at Silicon Valley’s ­eastern edge, a team of government scientists celebrated a major milestone in November. The machine under their care, housed in a room longer than a football field, had just achieved the official title of most powerful supercomputer in the world. If every single person on earth were to make one calculation per second, it would take them over 480 years to calculate what this supercomputer could in one minute. The machine is called El Capitan, after the massive granite rock formation in Yosemite National Park. At its heart are more than 44,000 AMD chips called accelerated processing units (APUs), which combine elements of CPUs and GPUs in the same chip. When Su heard the news that El Capitan had officially become the most powerful supercomputer in the world, she was ecstatic. “These are the days I live for,” she says. The achievement meant that the two most powerful supercomputers in the world are now powered by AMD chips. For Su, the win was about more than just bragging rights. “I personally visited the labs several times,” she says. Fulfilling her pledge to create best-in-class technology became almost an obsession, just as delivering Zen chips on time to waiting customers had been years earlier. “She’s so, so customer-centric,” says Vamsi Boppana, AMD’s senior vice president for AI. “She absolutely wants to delight, and that has served the company so well.” Su views supercomputing as the wellspring from which further AI profits will flow. The chips in El Capitan are “without a doubt, the most complex thing we’ve ever built,” she says. But they were not a single-purpose ­investment. The designs that AMD engineers used for El Capitan are already trickling down into the specialized AI chips supplied to clients like Meta and Micro­soft. The most advanced AMD chip currently on sale in the AI market, called the Instinct MI300X, is the “first cousin” of the chips inside El Capitan, says Mark ­Papermaster, AMD’s chief technology officer. That’s thanks to their chiplet-based designs, which make it relatively simple to switch in and out different components. “There is so much synergy between traditional high-­performance supercomputing and AI,” Su says. AMD always had a business in building GPUs for gaming, but after the release of ­ChatGPT in 2022, the company quickly spun up a more powerful line aimed at the data-center market. And in the past year, AMD’s projected revenue from specialized AI chip sales has leaped from essentially $0 to $5 billion, which would account for roughly 5% of that market. (Nvidia maintains a hammerlock on most of the rest.) This line of chips is now a popular choice for what’s known in the industry as AI “inference,” or the running of an already-formed AI system. For years, the easiest way to increase AI performance was by simply training bigger models on more GPU chips. But as some computer scientists report diminishing returns from that practice, companies are now turning to a different strategy: increasing the time AIs spend running ­instead—in the inference phase, rather than the training phase. That could be good news for AMD, whose inference chips are approaching parity with Nvidia’s in terms of not only speed but also energy efficiency, which matters even more when you’re running an AI over a longer period. “We do see inference as a growing piece of the market,” says Boppana. AMD is still struggling to break into the training phase of the market. That’s largely because Nvidia controls the world’s leading software for optimizing GPUs for that ­purpose—and it only works with Nvidia chips. The huge number of developers who already use it gives Nvidia an ongoing advantage. AMD is building its own competing software, but it is “absolutely behind Nvidia’s,” says Moorhead, the former AMD executive. Su says AMD is catching up. That’s partly thanks to an informal alliance with tech companies, including Meta, that want to avoid handing Nvidia an outright monopoly. Meta is buying AMD chips, contributing to AMD’s code base, and using its software in its data centers. “It’s a very good symbiotic relationship,” says Moorhead. “Without AMD, Nvidia can double their prices.” Says Su: “Nobody wants to be locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Really our strategy is: let’s invest in an open ecosystem. And then may the best chip win.” Yet in their bid to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, major AI companies have also begun to design some of their own chips in-house. That could threaten AMD in the long term. But Su doesn’t see it that way. “I actually see it as an opportunity,” she says. No company wants to replicate the $6 billion AMD pours into R&D annually, she argues. She sees instead a future where big tech companies continue to spend on AMD’s chips, while also relying on their own chips for certain workloads. “There’s no one-size-fits-all in computing,” she says. “The broader the ecosystem, the bigger the party.” If Su is right, the size of the party is going to keep on growing. She predicts the specialized AI chip market alone will grow to be worth $500 billion by 2028—more than the size of the entire semiconductor industry a decade ago. To be the No. 2 company in that market would still make AMD a behemoth. Sure, AMD won’t be overtaking Nvidia anytime soon. But Su measures her plans in decades. “When you invest in a new area, it is a five- to 10-year arc to really build out all of the various pieces,” she says. “The thing about our business is, everything takes time.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Title: What will the year 2025 bring for Linux PCs?

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

U.S. stock futures are little changed after markets stepped back from record highs on tech sector jitters; GameStop (GME) reports earnings after markets close today; Oracle (ORCL) shares drop as the tech firm’s revenue comes in lower than expected; European regulators reportedly are seeking information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google on its advertising program targeting teens on Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posts strong November sales, showing that AI demand remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes began the week on a down note, due in part to weakness in the tech sector. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking higher, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are pointing marginally lower. Investors are preparing to digest more earnings reports today and watching for inflation data later this week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $97,000, while gold futures are 0.6% higher. Oil futures are 0.5% lower and yields on the 10-year Treasury note are slightly higher at above 4.2%. GameStop (GME) shares are edging lower in premarket trading ahead of the video game retailer's third-quarter earnings report after markets close today. The report comes after the stock briefly surged last week after a cryptic social media post by meme-stock hero Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill evidently inspired some investors to buy in. GameStop stock is not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, with the one analyst tracked by Visible Alpha giving it an "underperform" rating and $10 price target, well below the $27.93 price shares closed at on Monday. Oracle (ORCL) stock is sinking 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations. The cloud services giant, whose shares hit record highs last week on enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) demand, reported revenue of $14.06 billion, up 9% year-over-year but below Visible Alpha estimates. Net income of $3.15 billion or $1.10 per share, up from $2.5 billion or 89 cents per share a year earlier, beat estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 slightly missed expectations. European regulators are seeking more information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google about the secret advertising partnership the search giant had with Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META), the Financial Times reported. The deal, which has since been ended, targeted Instagram advertisements to teenagers on YouTube, circumventing Google's rules barring personalized ads to those under 18. Shares of both Alphabet and Meta Platforms are higher in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, a signal that demand for AI-focused chips remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. The company reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion), down 12% from October's figures, while revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) turned more bullish on some bitcoin (BTC) mining stocks in its coverage following third quarter results and recent gains in bitcoin price and the network hashrate, the bank said in a report on Tuesday. The bank upgraded Cipher Mining (CIFR) and CleanSpark (CLSK) to overweight from neutral. JPMorgan also introduced a new price $8 price target for Cipher, and raised its CleanSpark price target to $17 from $10.50. MARA Holdings (MARA) was also upgraded to neutral from underweight and raised its price target on the stock to $23 from $12. The U.S. bank downgraded IREN (IREN) to neutral from overweight while increasing its price target on the shares to $15 from $9.50. It raised its Riot Platforms (RIOT) price target to $16 from $9.50, while maintaining its overweight rating on the company. The bank said it was introducing a new sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation framework for the miners, which took into account company's mining operations, their respective land and power portfolios, and their hodl balance to reflect any bitcoin that the firms may hold on their balance sheet. Cipher rose over 4% in early trading Tuesday, CleanSpark gained around 3.5%, MARA climbed over 2%, RIOT was almost 2% higher, and IREN was 0.4% better.

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin's bull-bear tug-of-war continues to rage, with prices recovering to over $97,000 from Monday's dip to $94,200. The slide was prompted by concern Google's new quantum-computing chip, Willow, could compromise BTC's security — a worry quickly dismissed by analysts. That leaves directional traders with little to do other than wait for the dust to settle before picking a side, as prices remain locked in Thursday's indecisive trading range. But there’s a silver lining! The turbulence has crowded out those undisciplined, overleveraged altcoin traders, as is evident from perpetual funding rates. Altcoin rates have receded closer to the center of Velo Data's heat map, which oscillates between -200% and 200%, indicating more balanced conditions than the bullish extremes of last week. Tokens like Stacks' STX even sport negative funding rates, a perfect entry point for bulls, according to pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General. "If these rates continue to decline, it could signal the unwinding of excessive long leverage, potentially leading to a more balanced market," analysts at Bitfinex said, adding that $100,000 is no longer the key support/resistance level and a new equilibrium is probably forming in spot markets. That said, as we look toward the end of 2024, there’s a developing story: Banks are getting bullish on the dollar, which doesn’t usually bode well for assets denominated in the U.S. currency, like BTC and risk assets. "The combination of cyclical, fiscal, and U.S. political forces is making the USD stronger again," HSBC said recently. "We update our USD bullish view further; the USD bubble is re-inflating, which spells trouble ahead for many other currencies." Citibank sees the dollar index (DXY) rallying to 115, an 8% increase. Keep an eye on the Far East too. A renewed rally in Chinese stocks following Beijing's promise of more stimulus could suck capital from other markets, including cryptocurrencies. Amid all this, there's talk President-elect Trump may struggle to deliver his crypto promises. Peter Tschir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, put it best: "Trump does have loyalty to those who helped fund his campaign, but I don't see this as a lasting relationship, especially as he will likely get a lot of pressure from the National Security element of D.C. to be cautious on helping crypto too much." After all, it's one thing to promise big from Mar-a-Lago and a different ball game when delivering from the White House. Stay Alert! By Shaurya MalwaEverything with "quantum" in the name is pumping! Various tokens themed after, or claiming to use, quantum computing within their technology stack jumped more than 100% in the past 24 hours after internet giant Google unveiled Willow, a quantum-computing chip that took 5 minutes to solve tasks during its testing period that would have taken 10 septillion years for current supercomputers to finish. Crypto markets took a hit after the announcement on concerns the development was long-term bearish for bitcoin and other blockchains, whose security features can, in theory, be exploited by quantum computers.But while the entire market dropped, tokens such as Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Quantum Network, Quantum Swap, among others, zoomed higher.Quantum-resistant or post-quantum tokens aim to use cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against quantum computing attacks. These algorithms are designed to resist attacks using Shor’s algorithm, which is particularly effective against current public-key cryptosystems. Tokens labeled with "quantum" might be perceived as being at the forefront of technology, even if their actual utility or relation to quantum computing is minimal. This perception can drive investment — and a chance to speculate on the short-term trading narrative.

Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

What makes a company a great place to work for IT professionals? Top salaries and benefits certainly help, but those are just table stakes. Tech workers are looking for challenging projects, growth opportunities, and continuous learning in a supportive workplace. For the 31st year, Computerworld publisher Foundry surveyed large, midsize, and small organizations to find the top IT employers. Read our special report to see which companies made our list and what makes them such desirable places to work. To read the Best Places to Work in IT 2025 report in PDF format, download it below (no registration required). The ongoing quest for technical talent in an uncertain economic environment has caused many organizations to turn their attention inward, taking steps to keep their existing IT workforce engaged and invested in the overall business charter. The goal: build a collaborative IT culture defined by continuous learning, meaningful work, and positive contributions to the business. Companies participating in Computerworld’s 31st annual “Best Places to Work in IT” survey show a strong commitment to in-house IT talent, even as they cast a wider net for IT candidates to build a more diverse workforce that fosters creativity and innovation. A heightened emphasis on training is designed to enrich technical skills — especially in artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, and the cloud — as well as soft skill sets that align with broader business objectives. “We are steadfast in our technology investments and continue to modernize our skill sets, technologies, and processes at the same speed as ever — or even faster,” says Deepa Soni, chief information and operations officer at The Hartford, ranked No. 2 overall and No. 4 in the career development/training category among large companies in this year’s survey. “We think about three things to make IT the best destination for internal and external folks: Leveraging cutting-edge technology and solutions, creating business impact, and building a culture that fosters creativity while being inclusive and diverse.” Our survey found that the relentless pace of new hiring over the past two years remains robust. Among the surveyed companies, 79% have increased the total number of IT employees over the last three years, on average by 36%. This is down from a high of 86% in the 2024 survey but surpasses the 72% of companies reporting three-year IT workforce gains in 2023. But although IT hiring is picking up steam again after a brief lull, survey respondents indicated that another cooling-off period may lie ahead. Just half of this year’s respondents plan to increase the number of IT hires over the next fiscal year, down significantly from the previous two years (71% and 72%, respectively). Nearly half of the organizations (46%) expect the size of their IT workforce to remain the same, with larger firms more likely to face hiring slowdowns. Conversely, 70% of smaller companies plan to add IT talent, with an average increase of 10%. VyStar Credit Union, ranked third overall among midsize company respondents, is being very intentional about its IT hiring strategy while it moves to fill key openings. The plan is to slowly augment its 271-person IT staff with several critical positions, including a high-level AI thought leader and champion, several data architects, and engineers versed in software development life cycle skills such as DevOps automation. “We are focused on how to make the best use of AI for our organization and are on a relentless journey to automate and streamline processes,” says Lisa Cochran, CIO of VyStar. “We are a heavily regulated organization, so we must have consistent ways of documenting changes. If we can capture and create artifacts without a human, then developers can spend less time on documentation.” Like VyStar, many other companies are mapping the smaller number of external hires to highly coveted emerging skills categories — many of which are in short supply in the general marketplace. Among this year’s respondents, most new open IT-related positions fall into critical skills groups such as AI/machine learning (86%), data science/analytics (78%), cloud/multicloud (76%), and IT/cybersecurity (67%). In each of these competency areas, companies have dialed up hiring over last year’s, most significantly in the AI/machine learning (ML) area, which saw a 12-point year-over-year hike. To address the need for more traditional IT skills, companies are relying more heavily on contract workers. In this year’s survey, the number of temporary or contract workers increased 10% on average across all respondents, compared with an average 7% decrease in contract workers hired over the prior 12 months. While casting an eye toward external talent, organizations continue to promote from within to hold onto existing talent. This year’s survey found that 13% of IT employees across all companies advanced to new positions in the last fiscal year, much as in the last two years (15% in the 2024 survey and 14% in 2023). Similarly, salary bumps remain in line with last year’s findings, with 90% of IT employees the beneficiaries of a raise. Salary cuts or wage freezes don’t appear to be on the table — the vast majority (96%) of this year’s respondents said no such plans were in the works, now or in the foreseeable future. This year’s survey indicates that IT professionals have plenty of opportunities to take advantage of internal programs to boost their career. Respondent companies are upleveling training programs with new curriculum that burnishes both technical and business skills, going deeper on high-demand technologies such as AI and cloud engineering while also providing education on soft skills such as change management and communications, to accommodate the increasing influence of digital technologies across the business. As part of the emphasis on internal employee development, companies are putting structures in place to help IT professionals actively chart a career course. New mentorship, apprenticeship, and job rotation programs deliver exposure to emerging technology domains as well as full immersion in the business. Defined learning paths and formalized skills assessments help IT workers be more intentional about identifying and addressing critical skills gaps when mapping out their next career move. These efforts continue to move the needle on internal mobility: Approximately 35% of IT vacancies are now being filled through company insiders, equal to last year’s percentage and down slightly from the 38% reported in the 2023 survey. At Amerisure Mutual Insurance, which ranked fourth overall among small companies and sixth for career development and training, communities of practice meet monthly or quarterly, providing cross-functional IT groups and business professionals with demonstrations, tutorials, and training to build expertise in areas such as agile, DevOps, and product architecture. In addition, all IT staffers now participate in a proprietary skills assessment that spells out current skills and targets key areas for improvement. “Development plans can be too broad and not actionable,” notes Amjed Al-Zoubi, Amerisure’s CIO. “This isn’t a checklist but, rather, a very clear conversation and development plan highlighting the skills they need to grow into specific jobs.” Amerisure also bolsters internal IT development practices by increasing the emphasis on business outcomes. Historically, Amerisure assigned people to projects from a central IT talent pool, reassigning them when work was complete. Today, IT teams are aligned with eight different business groups. “There were inefficiencies in our old process, and IT was limited in their ability to learn the business,” Al-Zoubi explains. “Now the IT underwriting team is aligned with the business underwriting team, and they work together to solve underwriting problems. We bring our best, and they bring their best, and it results in higher-performing teams.” Training courses offered by survey respondents run the gamut and are available to all IT employees, regardless of where they work. Technical training, technical certifications, and management training are the most prevalent forms of instruction, but there is also a heavy emphasis on professional career development, building business and soft skills, and even health and wellness. The Hartford is continuing to uplevel its skills development programs to stay abreast of the latest technology trends and leadership skills. For example, the firm has doubled training hours available for cloud, agile development, data science, and cybersecurity. The company’s HartCode Academy Bootcamp provides an avenue for non-IT people to learn software engineering and business data analysis skills, and there are numerous executive-level programs devoted to cultivating leadership skills. “We are helping IT leaders get really comfortable with change and how they lead teams,” Soni says. “We are training folks to be the CIOs of the future.” Given the emphasis on continuous learning, training budgets remain flush, with 39% of this year’s respondents increasing their training budget from the previous year and 59% reporting no change to their allocations. The number of companies increasing their training budget has fallen over the past two years, down from 62% in 2023 and 49% last year. Most companies don’t set caps on training: 77% give employees the latitude to participate in as many programs as they desire. Those that do restrict employees limit them to seven days, on average, of in-person or remote training annually. To spark engagement, companies are courting employees with a variety of tactics, including hosting employee appreciation events (98%), doling out bonuses or other high-value items to reward high performers (92%), and building clear career paths with attainable milestones (88%). Free career development services are also offered by 82% of the respondents. Mentoring programs remain a consistent and widely prevalent vehicle for upskilling existing IT workers, offered by 76% of the responding companies, which is similar to last year. Companies continue to dedicate time and money to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, confident that greater workforce diversity is an important element of company culture as well as a factor in upleveling innovation and diversity of thought. Overall DEI efforts have made an impact, but they’ve been slower to reshape the makeup of the traditional IT workforce, particularly when it comes to women, who made up 27% of the IT workforce among respondents this year, down slightly from 29% in 2024 and 28% in 2023. On the other hand, minority hires are on the rise. Among this year’s respondents, the number of people in IT identifying as part of a minority group jumped to 36%, compared to 33% in the 2024 survey. Minority groups accounted for 29% of the IT managers and 37% of the nonmanagers. The percentage of companies with a formal DEI strategy fell this year to 88%, down six points from 2024. Large firms were more likely to have a formal strategy, at 94%. Companies were also less likely to have a dedicated role in place to promote DEI (54% this year, compared to 62% in 2024), although most respondents (92%) maintain either a person or a team in place to champion DEI policies and awareness. The Hartford has been steadfast in its commitment to diversity, to the point where DEI is infused into company culture instead of serving as a stand-alone program, says Soni. “DEI is baked into the fabric of how we do business quite uniquely,” she says. “We view it as a business necessity — we have to represent the society that we live in in the workplaces we have.” To encourage greater understanding of DEI and its potential impacts, organizations such as The Hartford are serving up a smorgasbord of DEI training, including curriculum focused on preventing discrimination and harassment (96%) and creating an inclusive workspace (92%). Much of the DEI activity is consistent with last year’s survey, with one notable exception: providing targeted internships for women and minorities, at 50% this year, compared to 60% in the 2024 survey. The most popular steps for promoting DEI include celebration of employee differences (96%), recruitment strategies aimed at attracting diverse employees (94%), and diversity and inclusion training (93%). Creating corporate enterprise resource groups (ERGs) based on common goals, interests, and identity affiliations is another way organizations are fostering and empowering like-minded communities. Respondents are forming ERGs to support women, people of color, and LGBTQ populations as well as those aimed at niche areas such as caregivers, veterans, and even video gamers. One of The Hartford’s unique DEI efforts is its reverse mentoring program, where an employee with a diverse background is paired with a senior executive to help that person learn what it’s like to work in the firm as a diverse hire. “It’s about putting our executives in their shoes,” Soni says. The program, which started as an experiment, has been well received by executives as well as mentees, she says. Organizations are shoring up DEI efforts in part through leader accountability. Among the respondents, 33% evaluate IT leaders based on their progress on meeting specific DEI goals, up slightly from last year, 31%. At the same time, DEI progress and outcomes are having an impact on IT leader compensation: 22% this year, compared to 19% in 2024. OCLC, ranked second overall for midsize companies and first in the DEI category, has deployed many of these initiatives and is enjoying success in cultivating a more diverse IT workforce. The company, a nonprofit organization providing technology and services to the library community, has expanded recruiting efforts into diverse talent pools, including technology boot camps aimed at underrepresented communities, while forging partnerships with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Another lever for change: creating new job classes that remove the requirement for a four-year technical degree in tandem with instituting a local outreach coding program. “This produces staff with some level of familiarity with development, but not a degree,” says Bart Murphy, chief technology and information officer of OCLC. “We do a checkpoint every month to ensure the staffer is progressing and getting what they need to move up into an engineering role here or another organization. It’s helped build a diverse pipeline.” The DEI efforts are having an impact. OCLC has shown steady increases in BIPOC and female representation for the last 15 years. Currently the IT department boasts 29.5% female representation, better than the industry average, Murphy says. Well past the height of the pandemic, hybrid work models continue to be the norm, including in IT departments. Much like last year, most respondents (92%) to this year’s survey have established a formal policy on flexible work, although there is no one-size-fits-all model. The breakdown of employee work patterns has remained consistent with last year’s: On average, 13% of IT employees are reporting to the office on a daily basis; 31% are fully remote; and 56% work in some sort of hybrid model, splitting time in and out of the office. Most companies (71%) give employees a moderate level of autonomy to choose where they work, but often the arrangement needs to be approved by the company or meet certain parameters. That’s a notable change from last year, when 62% enjoyed moderate levels of autonomy and 35% could choose where they wanted to work on any given day. Midsize companies are more likely to leave the decision of where to work to employees, at 34%. Companies now have well-established policies to ensure hybrid work success, including provisioning a full slate of technology equipment, formalizing use of collaboration platforms, and training employees and managers on tools and communications best practices. VyStar’s flexible work program lets employees choose the days they work in-office or remotely. Individuals select eight days a month to be in the office, and managers and leaders choose 12 days. All employees can work remotely in July, a perk the company touts as creating better flexibility and work/life balance. “Remote July was created for people who want their kids to visit with grandparents or to see another country,” Cochran says, adding that once a request is made, the IT department provisions the proper secure technology to support the arrangements. “It’s a great benefit, and we get a lot of positive feedback.” Whether they’re recruiting new talent or developing the skills of their in-house teams, the leaders in this year’s “Best Places to Work in IT” study offer a variety of benefits to promote satisfaction and loyalty among the IT workforce. Programs range from comprehensive wellness plans and spot bonuses to financial wellness coaching and even pet insurance. Perhaps the most consequential factor influencing how IT professionals feel about their job is carving out opportunities for meaningful work and continuous professional development. At Tokio Marine North America Services, ranked second overall among small companies and first in both career development/training and DEI, this mindset translates into a culture that emphasizes leading-edge technologies in the context of driving business goals while providing individual advancement opportunities along the way. “Flexible work arrangements and fair compensation make it easier to get people in the door,” says Bob Pick, the company’s executive vice president and CIO. “To keep them here, we train the daylights out of everyone and ensure diagonal and horizontal career mobility. We retain great institutional knowledge, and people get a new career path. It’s a win-win.”— Beth Stackpole See the top workplaces for tech pros at large, midsize, and small organizations. 5,000 or more employees 1,001–4,999 employees 1,000 or fewer employees Computerworld publisher Foundry conducted its 31st annual survey to identify the best places for IT professionals to work. In April 2024, Computerworld started accepting nominations from organizations that had a minimum of 100 total employees and five IT employees. Participants were asked to provide contact information for a person at their organization who is familiar with or has access to employment statistics and financial data as well as benefits policies and programs for the IT department and the entire organization. Beginning in mid-April 2024, contacts at the nominated organizations received a 58-question company survey across six categories: In addition to receiving scores based on answers to closed-ended questions, the survey entries (including numerous open-ended responses) were reviewed and evaluated by a panel of industry experts. The nomination and company surveys were conducted online. Responses to the company survey were collected and tabulated by a third-party research vendor. The research was closed in July 2024. Our top 10 lists show the best of the best — the organizations that excel in each of the six categories covered. To determine each list, we considered the following factors: For scoring the responses from the company surveys, results were weighted against averages and benchmarks calculated within each company size group. The survey process was managed by Jen Garofalo, research director in Foundry’s Global Services group, working with independent firm Research Results, Inc.

Title: AI regulation will slow innovation to speed it up, DataStax CEO says

As artificial intelligence continues to barrel forward with increasingly capable models and applications, DataStax chief executive Chet Kapoor thinks governments will be more involved in the rollout of the technology — and that won’t necessarily be a bad thing. While Kapoor said he’s generally not in favor of government intervention because it risks stifling innovation, he’s all for it when it comes to AI. “Governments will have to be a little bit more involved,” the CEO said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video interview series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite (NDAQ). “We will need to think about governance from a country perspective, from an industry perspective, from a company perspective.” “In doing all of that, we may slow down things a little bit,” said Kapoor, whose company is a data platform providing stacks used by enterprises to build generative AI applications. “But we’ll be slowing it down to speed it up.” AI raises a number of red flags that regulators around the world will be forced to contend with, including data privacy, cybersecurity, and algorithmic biases. Although there are no federal rules explicitly aimed at AI in the U.S., the Biden administration has released an executive order on the safe use and development of AI, as well as a blueprint for a so-called “AI Bill of Rights.” Both documents aim to mitigate some of the risks associated with AI and lay the groundwork for further legislation. But President-elect Donald Trump has taken an deregulatory stance on most industries, particularly the financial services and housing sectors. When it comes to AI, he reportedly plans to repeal the Biden-era executive order and could instruct federal agencies to take a more hands-off approach to AI. Given that any number of guardrails could slow the progress on AI, albeit temporarily, Kapoor isn’t worried about AI outpacing what his company can provide. He’s excited about the opportunities AI is creating for companies — both AI native and non-native alike — to bolster their technological capabilities. “The AI natives get AI intuitively, they’re building their companies, their apps and things like that on it. They know exactly how to bring the different pieces together,” Kapoor said. “And I’m not talking about OpenAI and Google (GOOGL), I’m talking about the people starting companies in garages and the new Salesforces.” “The real fun, the real opportunity is not just those companies,” he added. “The real opportunity is how do you make sure that 30 million developers who are developing technology all over the world can actually use tools to build gen AI apps?” In October, DataStax announced its DataStax AI Platform, built using Nvidia (NVDA) AI. The platform, which integrates Nvidia AI Enterprise software, reduces AI development time by 60%, the company said. Kapoor said DataStax’s partnership with Nvidia has allowed the company to offer a tool that helps make developers more agile, and makes developing genAI apps more cost effective and scalable. “At the end of the day, we care about two things. Just two things,” he said. “We care about building products that developers love, that change the trajectory of the enterprises that they work for. Nvidia helps us with both.” Watch the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor above. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The Salesforce logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on November 29, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Given its better valuation, we believe that Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) is currently a better pick over its peer, Oracle stock. CRM stock trades at 9.5x trailing revenues, versus 9.8x for ORCL. Although Oracle is more profitable, Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think CRM will outperform ORCL in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. ORCL stock has seen strong gains of 225% from levels of $60 in early January 2021 to around $195 now, vs. an increase of about 65% for CRM stock from $220 to $360. This compares with roughly 60% gains for the S&P 500 over this four-year period. Admirably, ORCL stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -5% in 2022, 31% in 2023, and 85% so far in 2024. CRM stock hasn’t been that consistent, with returns of 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, 98% in 2023, and 38% this year – indicating that CRM underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including META, COMM, and AAPL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Salesforce has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 18.1% from $21.3 billion in 2021 to $34.9 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in January). On the other hand, Oracle’s average revenue growth rate of 9.5% from $40.5 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in May) over this period has been comparatively slower. Salesforce’s revenue growth lately has been driven by an increase in subscription and support sales, amid increased demand for its cloud-based offerings, including – Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. Salesforce aims to grow its revenues by leveraging the technological revolution that includes the demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company is benefiting from its AI system – Agentforce. The company continues to introduce AI capabilities across its offerings, which is resulting in increased adoption. Oracle’s revenue growth is also being driven by increased consumption of its cloud offerings. Oracle is benefiting from its success with generative AI workloads. In fact, it expects its revenue to double in five years, as more on-site database customers move to the cloud. As an aside, check out Sell LULU Stock, Buy eBay? Looking forward, both Salesforce and Oracle are expected to benefit from the rising demand for cloud and AI. Oracle is investing in AI infrastructure and has partnered with key players, including AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We expect both companies to see their sales rise at a low double-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. Looking at profitability, Oracle’s adjusted net income margin has declined from 34.9% in 2021 to 29.7% in 2024, while that for Salesforce has risen from 21.6% to 23.2% over this period. Now, Oracle’s 30.3% adjusted net income margin for the last twelve-month period fares much better than 25.5% for Salesforce. From a financial risk perspective, Salesforce seems to have an edge over Oracle. Its 3% debt as a percentage of equity is much lower than 16% for Oracle, while its 14% cash a percentage of assets is higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that Salesforce has a better debt position and more cash cushion. We see that Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. On the other hand, Oracle is more profitable. Now, looking at prospects, we believe CRM is the better choice of the two. At its current levels of $360, CRM stock is trading at 37x its trailing adjusted earnings of $9.70 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 43x over the last four years. In comparison, at its current levels of around $190, ORCL stock trades at 32x its trailing adjusted earnings of $5.77 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. We think that an upward revision in valuation multiple for both stocks is warranted, given the rising AI-based cloud demand. ORCL stock, trading at a valuation multiple much higher than its historical average, while CRM stock trading at a multiple lower than historical average, doesn’t make sense in our view. We think this gap will narrow in favor of CRM. While both stocks may offer robust gains in the long term, if one has to pick, we believe CRM is a better choice. While CRM may outperform ORCL in the next three years, it is helpful to see how Salesforce’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

(Bloomberg) -- Baillie Gifford & Co., known for investing in hyper-growth tech stocks, now likes “boring” US infrastructure companies as it sees a building boom after many years of under-investment. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Ambitions NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit “We think there’s going to be a massive building boom certainly in the US, the UK and in some other places,” Stuart Dunbar, a partner at the Edinburgh-based firm, told Bloomberg in Tokyo. Baillie Gifford still likes some US big tech stocks but is underweight on many of them now because of high valuations, he said. “In parts of Europe and in the US, the infrastructure is just falling apart. It’s been under-invested for 50 years and it’s getting to the point where it can’t be ignored any longer, with bridges falling down literally,” Dunbar said. “It’s quite an unexpected source of growth, like building aggregates suppliers, drainage systems providers,” he said, mentioning companies such as Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and Stella-Jones Inc. as among its favorites. Baillie Gifford has been known for its big bets in large tech firms such as Tesla Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But it’s now underweight most such US stocks — an unusual stance for the firm — despite its positive long-term view on them, Dunbar said. Investment in suppliers of water pipes and utility poles is by no means a departure from its growth stock strategy, though. “We will look wherever we need to look to try to find the companies that we think have got the ability not only to grow quickly, but to do so profitably,” Dunbar said. For tech stocks, Nvidia Corp.’s high valuation depends on continued growth, according to the investment manager. Nvidia, which makes chips used for AI data centers, trades at 34 times expected earnings, well above 23 times for the S&P 500 index. “That growth isn’t likely sustainable in the long term unless we start to see meaningful value coming through from applications of AI, so we’ve been top-slicing it,” Dunbar said, adding that Baillie Gifford still holds Nvidia and doesn’t have a negative view. Baillie Gifford is more cautious on Google parent Alphabet Inc., fretting that “AI could be a Google killer,” Dunbar said. On the other hand, it’s still a fan of Amazon because strong research and development spending allows it keep a solid competitive position. Meta also has a strong data set on which the firm can build AI capabilities, while Tesla has “incredible robotics and energy businesses” even though its rival BYD Co. “makes better cars at half the price,” he added. BYD is among China tech shares that Baillie Gifford sees coming back, despite headwinds from threats of tariffs from the US, and Europe in the case of EV makers. Elsewhere, the investment manager thinks digital banking is an important trend, betting on fintech firms such as Nu Holdings Ltd. in Brazil and Adyen NV in the Netherlands.

Title: Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG could usher in a new, inevitable M&A wave

Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 That’s one hell of a way for the agency holding companies to end the year. Just as everyone was looking to slow down and take a holiday-induced break before what will be a turbulent 2025, along comes Omnicom with a proposed stock-driven acquisition of Interpublic Group. The two CEOs — Omnicom’s John Wren and IPG’s Philippe Krakowsky — shared on their conference call Monday morning to announce the deal that they have been discussing this combination for the better part of a year. Suffice it to say that, should the deal clear regulatory and shareholder approvals — (those CEOs are hoping it will clear in the second half of 2025) — the combined $30 billion revenue will give the industry the equivalent of a megalodon shark in a sea of great whites and hammerheads. Lest we forget, megalodon went extinct because it was simply too big. So before panic sets in too significantly for the likes of WPP, Publicis and Dentsu, and the myriad independent agencies that have made a living feeding off the fish that the sharks don’t eat, this kind of bigger isn’t always seen as better. But to hear Wren and Krakowsky tell it, this merger makes more sense today than ever. They have their eyes on the Googles and Metas of the world. So much that Krakowsky referred the combined company as a platform rather than a holdco. “Being a part of what is now a platform, essentially a company with exceptional talent and reach and capabilities, and knowing that you can bring those to bear for your client, or that they’re going to give you an opportunity, as John [Wren] says, to build a more interesting career — there’s a lot of enthusiasm for it inside our organization,” he told analysts and reporters on a Monday morning conference call with Wren and both companies’ CFOs. The combined entity would become by far the largest holding company in the communications world, with an expected cash flow of more than $3 billion, according to the information provided by the companies. The principals also cite the complementary resources and geographies. A few examples: But the truth is, both companies needed to do this. Of the six sources reached for this story, all noted that IPG has not had a good stretch the last few years, having lost Amazon, General Motors and several other large and small clients that outweighed its gains. Two sources even said they see Omnicom’s acquisition as a bit of a bailout. “I think this is a very welcome distraction from what has been a disastrous year for IPG,” said one executive outside both companies, who declined to speak for attribution. Added David Jones, CEO of Brandtech Group, a rival to both holdcos: The acquisition “makes huge sense in the short term — both have been having their lunch eaten by Publicis, and IPG declined last year in organic growth. This gives both of them a story for their shareholders. It gives the merged company the ability to carry out financial re-engineering and restatements that will help the numbers look better in the short term.” Ouch. Meantime, the union doesn’t come cheaply. In the Monday conference call, Wren cited $450 million in “one-time cash cost” to close the deal and achieve $750 million in “cost synergies” — which includes layoffs among the 100,000 employees of both holdcos. Oddly, Wren did add, and employees of both companies should take note: “Any employee listening to this, if you’re associated with any revenue stream at all, you’re gold, don’t worry about it.” Observers of the deal don’t think things will end up quite so magnanimously for staffers, particularly those in back-office roles. “This deal will no doubt create a lot of uncertainty for staff and clients on both sides,” said Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “Notwithstanding the cost synergies (and implications this will bring), clients will be considering how their requirements will be met during an extreme period of transition and transformation.” How is the rest of the agency world affected? For one, it will most likely set off a chain reaction of M&A, because no other holding company can stay put as they are. “I expect to see more M&A activity on the back of this deal,” said Kangisser. “It’s easy to forget there are a number of very well funded, and highly acquisitive challenger groups who will look to fill this vacuum and provide clients with greater optionality.” “Start looking at all these other combinations,” said another high-level agency executive who declined to speak on the record. “The other guys are going to have to do something. I think this is the starting gun for major, major consolidation.” Every source reached for this story had their own scenario that could unfold. WPP, which has just been leapfrogged in size and scale, has long been the subject of breakup rumors. Havas just got spun out by parent company Vivendi, making it easier to pick by the likes of, say, Accenture or Dentsu. And Publicis, which analysts see as neck and neck with Omnicom in its success in the marketplace, isn’t likely to be left in the dust, despite already having acquired Influential and Mars United Commerce earlier this year. Nor should Omnicom itself be precluded from other purchases. Wren said the the $3 billion in cash flow would allow the company to continue to be acquisitive. For independents who have staked their claim to being the antidote to the holdco system and process, Christmas seemingly has come early. The deal “provides the independents the room to be able to articulate their propositions,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester. “Their counterpoint is skill, and this just helps frame their proposition of being able to balance the buying scale that they’re accumulating with the performance scale that they’ve developed.” And how will clients feel about this? Amazon just left IPG and gave some of its media business to Omnicom. Will this stir up unhappiness? Wren and Krakowsky poo-poo’d any notion that clients will have a problem with the acquisition. Jay Wilson, an analyst at Gartner, noted that the size of client will impact how much they’re affected. “It’s unlikely any single client will see an immediate impact on its relationship with existing IPG or Omnicom agencies, and those with large relationships at a holding company level will probably see the slowest transition — for example to a new hold-co wide data spine like IPG’s Acxiom,” said Wilson. “Clients of single agencies within these networks may be the first affected, if and when the new organization decides to merge individual agencies, as many hold co’s have been doing in recent years.” How Omnicom’s proposed acquisition of IPG keeps marketers guessing. The acquisition is expected to yield $750 million in annual cost synergies within two years. Omnicom CEO John Wren and IPG CEO Philippe Krakowsky said the plan is to pool resources for bigger AI investments.

Title: Oracle stock is down almost 8% after earnings miss and elevated cloud expectations

Oracle fell nearly 8% in extended trading after it reported quarterly earnings that slightly missed estimates and the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance. The software provider reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase. It reported $4.21 billion in profit, or $1.47 per share, for the three months that ended in late November. Oracle's cloud services business, which has customers including OpenAI, xAI, and Nvidia, grew 12% from last year and made up 77% of the company's total quarterly revenue. Oracle said it expects revenue growth between 7% and 9% for the current quarter. This would bring revenue expectations to about $14.3 billion, below analyst estimates of $14.65 billion. The company's business is booming due to sky-high demand for computing from artificial intelligence companies seeking to train their models. Oracle's stock has surged 80% this year, boosting its market value from below $165 billion in late 2022 to north of $500 billion. The enterprise-computing giant's stock decline on Monday resulted from high expectations going into the results. Fiscal second-quarter expectations are elevated coming out of a bullish September analyst day and long-term revenue targets that imply a multi-year growth acceleration, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note last week. At the analyst day in September, Oracle forecast annual revenue to rise to at least $104 billion in fiscal year 2029, a sign of its continued growth in cloud infrastructure. Investors are likely also reacting to mixed results. Key metrics include capital expenditure, which was above consensus; growth of infrastructure-as-a-service, which was in line with consensus; and growth of backlog, an Oracle product, which missed estimates. Oracle competes with Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure business. "Our cloud is faster and is less expensive than other clouds," Oracle's CEO Safra Catz said on an earnings call on Monday. "We remain the preferred cloud for AI workloads." On Monday, the company also announced a deal with Meta to use Oracle's AI cloud infrastructure to develop the social media giant's Llama AI models. Oracle's soaring stock price this year has boosted the net worth of Larry Ellison, who cofounded the company and is chief technology officer. His Oracle stock — he holds more than 40% of the company's shares — puts him third on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, worth $234.8 billion as of Monday. Jump to

They also awaited new U.S. inflation data set for release this week. The S&P 500 lost 0.3% to end at 6,034.91, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25% to 19,687.24. Both indexes booked back-to-back losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a fourth day, sliding 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to 44,247.83. Oracle shares slumped 6.7% after the database software company posted fiscal second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's estimates. The stock has jumped around 68% this year. "[The market] has been narrowing over the past week," CFRA Research's chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said to CNBC. "Investors are waiting to see if that simply is your traditional seasonal softness in mid-December, and I think [they] are expecting the participation to broaden out once again as the market does indeed go through an end-of-year pop." Alphabet was a breakout winner of the session, advancing 5.6%, on the back of Google making a major breakthrough in quantum computing with the unveiling of its new chip. That puts its year-to-date gains at more than 32%. This comes after the major averages fell on Monday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.6%, dropping from recent records as shares of Nvidia declined. Shares of the chip giant were more than 2% lower Tuesday, extending losses seen in the previous session after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the company for possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. By contrast, Meta Platforms, which also saw losses on Monday, was up 1% Tuesday. Investors are now waiting on the U.S. consumer price index report, which is due Wednesday and could influence how the Federal Reserve proceeds on interest rates at its Dec. 17-18 meeting. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast that headline inflation rose 0.3% in November and 2.7% over the prior 12 months. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to finish at 44,247.83 on Tuesday. The broad market S&P 500 also fell 0.3% to settle at 6,034.91, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25% to finish at 19,687.24. — Sean Conlon U.S. Steel shares plunged late Tuesday afternoon on a report that President Joe Biden plans to block the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel later this month. U.S. Steel stock was briefly halted due to volatility. The company's shares were down more than 9% after trading resumed. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Biden will block the $14.1 billion sale once the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States submits its review to him by Dec. 22 or Dec. 23. — Spencer Kimball Kroger and Albertsons shares moved in opposite directions after a U.S. judge nixed the grocers' planned $25 billion merger. Kroger shares surged 4%, while Albertsons shares tumbled more than 3% and hit a 52-week low. The Biden administration had fought against the deal, arguing the combination would reduce competition and lead to higher prices at the supermarket. However, Kroger pushed back against this argument. Management claimed becoming a larger entity would result in cost savings that could then be passed on to their customers. Kroger shares have outperformed the market this year, with a 32% gain, while Albertsons shares have fallen 22%. — Christina Cheddar Berk President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans may not go into effect for some time, according to Wolfe Research's Stephanie Roth. "We don't expect sweeping tariffs to go into effect until late 2025 — Republicans are reportedly discussing how to potentially leverage tariff revenue in a broader fiscal package, which increases the odds tariffs happen late in 2025 rather than early," the firm's chief economist wrote. If a 10% universal baseline tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S. were to be implemented, Roth estimates the U.S. economy will be hit up to 1.2% in gross domestic product, and inflation will see a boost of 1.1%. — Sean Conlon The market may likely see more upside over the coming weeks, according to Barclays. "Momentum seems so strong that a continued rally seems the path of least resistance for the rest of 2024," analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote in a note this week. Rajadhyaksha also said bond markets are expected to be "range-bound," given that investors are awaiting more details on President-elect Donald Trump's policies. — Sean Conlon The S&P 500 has had more declining than advancing stocks in each of the last six completed trading days, according to BTIG data. Despite that, it has been a winning period for the broad index in an unusual twist. The S&P 500 is up around 0.3% during that timeframe. There has never been a six-day run with both negative daily breadth and a positive overall return in the past two decades, according to BTIG. — Alex Harring While stocks may be due for more gains in 2025, Citi believes investors should also brace for more volatility given an uncertain policy outlook and raised valuations. "We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025," the firm's U.S. equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote. "Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promise, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle." The strategist has a year-end 2025 base case target for the S&P 500 of 6,500, allowing for gains in the mid-single digits next year. However, his bull case of 6,900 and bear case of 5,100 allow for a broad range of outcomes. "Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year," Chronert continued. — Sean Conlon Oracle shares shed about 8% and are on pace for their worst day since Dec.12, 2023. The decline came on the heels of a disappointing fiscal second-quarter earnings report that fell short of Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Oracle also issued a weak current-quarter outlook. The drop in shares comes as Oracle heads for its best year since 1999 as investors snatch up shares of cloud infrastructure players assisting companies with the demand storage needs for artificial intelligence models. — Samantha Subin During Tuesday's trading session, eight stocks in the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. Names that hit this milestone included: On the flip side, just three stocks were trading at their 52-week lows: Baxter, Centene and Teleflex. — Lisa Kailai Han, Christopher Hayes Semiconductor stocks dropped on Tuesday, putting downward pressure on the market. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) each slid more than 2%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was near flat and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.2%. Among the worst-performing semi stocks was Broadcom, which slid about 4%. Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor also each dropped more than 3%. Notably, artificial intelligence darling Nvidia shed nearly 2%. — Alex Harring Shares of Alphabet rose more than 5% in afternoon trading following Google's breakthrough in quantum computing. The company said its new chip, known as Willow, is able to decrease errors "exponentially" as the amount of qubits, which are considered the units of information in quantum computing, are increased. This "cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years," Google also said. The stock's move brings its year-to-date gains to more than 32%. Shares have also risen more than 24% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon The dollar index rose 0.4% Tuesday to 106.58. Against the euro, the dollar gained 0.5%. The euro last traded at 1.05 against the greenback. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened 0.6% to 152.13 yen, and climbed 0.4% against the won to 1,434.23. In December, the greenback has gained 1.6% and 2.8% against the won and the yen, respectively. — Hakyung Kim Walgreens Boots Alliance shares popped 18% in midday trading, after briefly halting for volatility, following a Wall Street Journal report, citing sources familiar, that said the pharmacy chain is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The deal could be completed as soon as early next year if talks don't fall apart, the report said. Sycamore Partners declined CNBC's request for comment. The move would take Walgreens off the public market after it was booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year. The stock is down 57% in 2024. — Sarah Min Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: For the full list, read here. — Pia Singh There were just 209 advancers in the S&P 500, with the index itself little changed as investors awaited this week's consumer prices data. Communication services and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors, up 2% and 0.8%, respectively. By contrast, real estate stocks slid 1%. Boeing was the No. 1 stock in the broader index, gaining more than 5% after Reuters, citing people familiar, said the company restarted production of its 737 Max jetliner. On the other hand, Super Micro Computer and Oracle were lower by 8% and 7%, respectively. — Sarah Min The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) dipped 0.5% on Tuesday, putting the fund on track for its fourth straight losing session and sixth in the past seven, according to FactSet data. The declines have also come during the session. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out in a post on social media site X, the RSP has seen intraday declines in six straight sessions. It would need to rally and close above $184.46 to snap that streak on Tuesday. The struggles for the RSP are notable because the equal weight fund can be a proxy for market breadth. While the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated in a handful of tech names over the past year, the behavior of the RSP is more indicative of the broader large cap stock universe. — Jesse Pound China-focused exchange-traded funds relinquished some gains on Tuesday, a day after the country promised "more proactive" fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) and iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) each slid just over 4.5% in late morning trading. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) also dropped more than 4.5%. Despite those slides, all three funds are still higher compared with where they started the week. That underscores the strength of Monday's rally. — Alex Harring The Trump Trade is already running out of steam, according to Wolfe Research. "Uncertainty in the first half of 2025 should put a damper on the 'Trump Trade,'" the firm's chief investment strategist Chris Senyek wrote Tuesday. "So in the meantime we'd continue to own the Mag 7!" The Trump Trade will have three parts, Senyek wrote, with the first part unwinding in the immediate aftermath of the election. Senyek expects the second part of the trade will likely come in the first 100 days of the president-elect's term. The third, he said, will come in the second half of 2025, as incoming data indicates whether Trump's policy agenda is a positive or negative for economic growth. For now, as the first part of the Trump Trade finishes its course, Senyek said he would stick to the "Magnificent Seven" that are not in the "crosshairs of policy risk" through the first half of 2025. — Sarah Min Shares of Sirius XM slid more than 8% on Tuesday after the radio operator appointed a new chief operating officer and announced cost-cutting initiatives. The firm said it will target an initial incremental $200 million of annualized savings as it exits 2025, citing "marketplace headwinds." The company said it will also move its marketing and other resources away from "high-cost, high-churn audiences in streaming." — Yun Li Stocks were relatively unchanged Tuesday morning. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose almost 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88 points, or 0.2%. — Sean Conlon Shares of Alaska Air Group rose nearly 11% in premarket trading on the heels of the carrier raising its fourth-quarter earnings forecast and authorizing a $1 billion stock buyback. The company now expects earnings to come in between 40 cents and 50 cents per share, up from its prior guidance of 20 cents to 40 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share for the period. Alaska Air also announced it is going to launch new nonstop flights to Japan and Korea in 2025 as part of its plan to deliver $1 billion in profit by 2027. The stock has outperformed the broader market this year, jumping more than 38% year to date. Shares have also gained around 36% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon, Leslie Josephs Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas appears to be cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the auto industry heading in 2025. "The US election result has extended the 'ICE is Nice' trade for a bit longer but keep on the lookout for hidden value in the EV ecosystem into the 2H. We recommend investors stay nimble and selective given the volatility of policy outcomes," Jonas said in a note to clients on Tuesday. "ICE" stands for internal combustion engine, the traditional alternative to electric vehicles. Morgan Stanley made two changes to its ratings of auto stocks: an upgrade of General Motors to equal weight from underweight, and hiking the price target on Tesla to $400 per share from $310. The new price target is just 2.5% above where Tesla closed on Monday, but the stock is still Jonas' top pick in the industry. Tesla could be a beneficiary from the new Trump administration if change leads to regulatory changes that usher along an autonomous driving future. "If the Trump Administration looks to clear the path for a Federal framework on autonomous vehicles, we believe investors will eventually appreciate that the discussion of AVs is also a discussion about EVs. Among a range of policy tools, we see tariffs as a lever to help accelerate onshoring of enabling technology underpinned by more de-risked supply chain," Jonas said. — Jesse Pound These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Lisa Kailai Han Small businesses sentiment popped to its highest level in nearly three and a half years following November's presidential election, the National Federation of Independent Business reported Tuesday. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index hit 101.7 for November, an increase of 8 points and the best reading since June 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had forecast a reading of 94.8. "The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners," said Bill Dunkelberg, the group's chief economist. "Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations." Along with the higher reading for the headline index, the share of business owners expecting a better economy ahead jumped 41 points from October to a net 36%, the highest since June 2020. — Jeff Cox Fears surrounding aluminum packaging company Ball are overstated, according to Mizuho, which believes investors should buy the recent pullback in shares. The firm upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and maintained its $67 price target, which is 16% above where shares closed on Monday. "Despite recent misplaced concerns about pricing and volume, we don't believe earnings are at risk, or that fundamentals have changed. We believe the recent pullback in the shares represents a good buying opportunity and an attractive entry point," analyst Edlain Rodriguez wrote in a Tuesday note. The company shut down around 15% of its manufacturing capacity to account for lower consumer demand post-pandemic. "That capacity closure has better positioned Ball for the medium-term as demand gradually normalizes," Rodriguez said. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares were down slightly a day after the chipmaker pulled back on China launching an investigation into the company possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. The stock was last down 0.3% in the premarket. On Monday, it fell 2.6%, leading to Nvidia's longest losing streak since September. — Fred Imbert Citi believes Broadcom's fiscal fourth-quarter results will top expectations ahead of the company's earnings release on Thursday. Analyst Christopher Danely raised his price target on shares to $205 from $175, implying 14.6% upside potential from Monday's close. Danely also reiterated his buy rating on the stock. Danely estimates Broadcom could report up to $15 billion in sales, or a 7% rise from the previous quarter. The company's non-AI semiconductor business will likely drive its better-than-consensus results, he added. Current-quarter guidance could be held back on a slowdown in orders from Google, a leading AI customer, Danely said. "We do expect business to ramp from Meta throughout C25 and pick up the slack," Danely wrote in a Tuesday note. — Hakyung Kim South Korean markets led gains in Asia on Tuesday, with the country's blue-chip Kospi surging 2.43% and seeing its best day in almost three months, while the small-cap Kosdaq spiked 5.52%. That comes as the country continues to grapple with the fallout of President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law declaration. Other markets in Asia also climbed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.53% and mainland China's CSI 300 rising by 0.73%. — Lim Hui Jie European stocks opened lower on Tuesday, as investors reacted to Chinese import and export figures that came in below expectations in November. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was 0.25% lower shortly after the opening bell, with all major bourses trading in negative territory. Read the latest here. — Chloe Taylor Check out some of the companies making headlines in extended trading: Read the full list here. — Brian Evans Stock futures were little changed on Monday, after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite pulled back from their respective highs. S&P 500 futures ticked down 0.03%, while Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.01%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline. — Brian Evans Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Is NextEra Energy (NEE) the Best Wind Power and Solar Stock to Invest in Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-nee-best-wind-215341237.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Wind Power and Solar Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best wind power and stocks to invest in now. According to a report by the World Economic Forum published on November 8, the US election result is expected to have a significant impact on the transition to renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy stocks fell sharply following the election, as Donald Trump's victory is anticipated to have a negative short-term impact on current climate policies. The president-elect has proposed policies that include increasing natural gas pipelines, ending offshore wind energy projects, and boosting fossil fuel production by easing restrictions on drilling on federal lands. He has also expressed intentions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and to support nuclear energy production. Despite these challenges, analysts predict that the boom in renewable energy in the US is unlikely to be dramatically slowed. The Inflation Reduction Act passed during the outgoing administration, is expected to inject $1 trillion of spending into green energy, with estimates that 85% of the money has gone to districts that elected Republicans. This financial support, along with existing opposition to the curtailment of renewable energy, suggests that the long-term trajectory of the energy transition remains uncertain but potentially resilient. READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 13, Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares, discussed the potential implications of a Trump presidency on renewable energy such as wind and solar. Rhind noted that the playbook on energy policy was already seen in the previous Trump administration. The Trump administration has historically been more supportive of fossil fuels and less focused on renewable energy. Therefore, stocks and sectors favored by the Biden administration, such as solar and wind, might see a downturn. Rhind suggested that the overall narrative may seem like it's shifting back toward traditional energy sources. However, Elon Musk seems to be playing an integral role in the Trump administration, and he has been a proponent of climate policies, with his electric vehicle (EV) industry and other businesses, which suggests that energy transition policies may not be as impactful as some might expect today. While the outcome of the US election and the anticipated policies of the new administration pose short-term challenges to renewable energy, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic. To compile our list of the 10 best wind power and solar stocks to invest in now, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 wind and solar energy stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

NextEra Energy Inc.'s (NYSE:NEE) experience in developing and operating large-scale renewable energy projects makes it a leader in the industry. The company is investing heavily in the development of new solar and wind projects. The company's wind repowering program has expanded to approximately 1.6 gigawatts of wind projects owned by NextEra Energy Partners through 2026. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is also investing in the development of new solar projects, with a focus on low-cost solar and battery storage. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is capitalizing on the growing demand for renewable energy by expanding its solar and wind offerings.

© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Tesla (TSLA) is one of the most closely followed and debated stocks. That’s what happens when you create a new industry (electric vehicles) and trade in a price range from $100 to $400, and back to $100 again, all within a few years time. And let’s not forget the emergence of Tesla founder Elon Musk on the political front. All this may lead investors to wonder how best to get exposure to Tesla stock, other than buying it directly. That’s where exchange-traded funds can represent a wide range of “access points” for different types of objectives. Popular indexes like the S&P 500 have ETFs that allow investors to profit from its declines, to earn extra income from it via option positions, and to add leverage. More recently, allowing investors to put those types of enhancements around individual stocks has been a priority for some ETF product creators. But in the case of Tesla, we might just have the widest array of choices for how to “drive” your profits forward. Here are seven I picked out, and how I’d potentially use them. Note that these are my own observations and research. They are not recommendations, simply a way to expand the range of what is possible for investors who don’t drill down on this as I have been doing for decades. Do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

AMZN is 22% and Home Depot (HD) checks in at 8%. So nearly half of XLY is in these three stocks. XLY has $24.3 billion in assets under management and a low expense ratio of 0.09%. I want to own Tesla but with some diversification around it. This is one way in which my approach to ETF investing is likely very different from most. I like concentrated funds, since it allows me to zero in on a smaller basket of names that at times are really all I want from that market segment. I don't need a piece of 93 stocks in a single sector! This is for investors who prefer to reduce the risk of any single stock. The focus of this ETF is long-term growth of capital achieved by investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products and technologies, such as autonomous mobility, intelligent devices, adaptive robotics, neural networks, reusable rockets and advanced batteries. Tesla is ARKQ’s top holding (17% of assets). ARKQ has total assets of $968 million and an expense ratio of 0.75%. Complements TSLA exposure with allocations to defense, cybersecurity and space exploration. Volatility. Made a big “round trip” in price the past three years, losing 50% and then gaining 100% to net out to a break-even over that period. I want to own TSLA and other autonomous tech stocks, but not Amazon. This is also a diversification move around Tesla stock, though using a thematic group of stocks instead of just those in the same consumer discretionary sector. This is TSLA times 2, though it is not always that simple. As with all ETFs that, like this one, employ leverage, the concept of making 2x the gain or loss of TSLA should be assumed to only be good on a daily basis.Still when TSLA goes on one of those manic upside runs, 2x is an attractive consideration to me. TSLL has an expense ratio of 0.96%. “All bulled up” on Tesla, with potential to make twice as much as owning the regular common stock. What Tesla giveth twice as much, it also taketh away twice as much. Since I'm a chartist at the core, I can decide to buy a good TSLA chart or buy a good TSLL chart with half the assets at risk. This ETF might appeal to those who are comfortable with leverage, pursuing twice the gain with twice the risk. Leveraged ETFs are a relatively new creation. Single inverse ETFs have been around since 2006. And that means I've been using them liberally for 18 years. The ones that move opposite major market indexes have been a "go-to" for me as an offense-defense investor since prior to the global financial crisis. Newer on the scene are single stock inverse ETFs, such as the ones offered by Direxion, T-Rex and other fund firms. Again, the daily objective means that longer time periods often will not be the mirror image of the underlying "long" stock performance. TSLS has an expense ratio of 1.07%. Efficient way to essentially “short” TSLA, on a 1:1 daily basis. Investors tend to undereducate themselves on the “math of investment loss.” In other words, if TSLA goes up 20% as it has done in short time periods many times, this would drop approximately 20%. But that means you need to make 25% just to get back to even, not 20%. When I think TSLA is overpriced short-to-intermediate term, and want to try to profit from a potential decline of some magnitude. TSLS could appeal to those who wish to try to profit from a decline in TSLA. Note that big “round trip” move I noted at the start of this article.

That would not have worked well if held throughout 2024. But don't be fooled by that full-year summary. During the course of this, its first full year of existence, TSLZ has had 1-month up moves of 80%, 50% and 30%. These are tactical vehicles, period. Potentially a “cleaner” way to try to capitalize on declines in Tesla stock than using put options. That’s because TSLA is so volatile, buying options can be very expensive. I own TSLA but am concerned about its near-term price picture, so I can consider this to hedge some of that, and try to avoid the full downside risk. Or, I can use this to try to profit from the next major dip in TSLA. For those who don’t just think the stock will fall, but do so quickly, this ETF, like other inverse funds, aims to be held for short time periods. This is another in the series from YieldMax ETFs that I've written about here recently. TSLY aims to deliver a very high income return and a total return of about 80% of the ups and downs of TSLA stock. TSLY has total assets of $1.0 billion and an expense ratio of 1.0% Big income payout, aims to capture about 80% of up moves in TSLA on a total return basis. Tends to track about 80% of the downside in the stock. Bullish on TSLA but prefer to earn more of my total return as income, with some upside potential beyond that. This relatively new ETF might appeal to those who want to ride along with Tesla, but exchange some potential capital appreciation for current income. Finally, another one from YieldMax, but a departure from their core product line. This fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.99%, started trading in May, so I'll use this directly from the fund management firm: YieldMax Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate monthly income from a synthetic covered put strategy on TSLA, while providing indirect short exposure to the share price of TSLA. CRSH seeks to benefit when the TSLA share price decreases, however CRSH’s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the TSLA share price is limited. CRSH seeks to manage potential losses (i.e., cap losses if the TSLA share price experiences significant gains) by purchasing OTM call options. Big income payout. This brand new ETF is only for the very bold, and who are bearish on Tesla stock. It produces a high income level, but declined more than 40% of its price during its first six months in existence. The good news on TSLA: it has more than doubled since last spring. The bad news on TSLA: that giant move brought it back to where it traded about three years ago. I'm no fan of "dead money” (old Wall Street term) especially when it comes in the form of a political football, which was halfway to a meme stock even before the founder ended up in a potentially influential quasi-government position. There's a lot to consider here, and this story is much more complex than a lot of places I can decide to put my money. Knowing that these ETFs exist is step one. Understanding them is step two. Determining how to use them, when to use them and how to avoid getting burned from anything related to Tesla's volatile underlying stock price movement is all part of the "next level" of learning how to design portfolios for modern markets.

Title: AMD downgraded after BI report on weak demand for its AI chips among AWS customers

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:20:51Z

Bank of America downgraded AMD after a Business Insider report raised concerns about demand for the tech company's AI chips. Analysts at BofA cut AMD shares to a "neutral," citing "higher competitive risk" in the AI market, according to an analyst note published on Monday. BofA analysts also lowered their AMD GPU sales forecast for next year to $8 billion, from $8.9 billion, implying a roughly 4% market share. AMD's stock dropped roughly 5.6% on Monday, after falling about 2% on Friday. Its shares are down about 5% so far this year. The declines follow BI's report on Friday that said Amazon Web Services was "not yet" seeing strong enough customer demand to deploy AMD's AI chips through its cloud platform. Bank of America cited this AWS customer-demand issue, alongside Nvidia's dominance and the growing preference for custom chips from Marvell and Broadcom, as factors limiting AMD's growth potential. "Recently largest cloud customer Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD," the Bank of America note said, referring to AWS's in-house AI chip Trainium and its close partnerships with Marvell and Nvidia. Spokespeople from Amazon and AMD declined to comment on the story last week. After publication of both articles, the companies got back in touch with BI and shared comments. In an email to BI, AMD's spokesperson said it has a "great relationship" with AWS. "We are actively engaged with AWS and end customers on AI opportunities," the spokesperson said. AWS's spokesperson said in an email to BI, "AWS and AMD work together closely, as we continue to make AWS the best place to run AMD silicon. Based on the success of AMD CPUs on AWS, we are actively looking at offering AMD's AI chips." AMD recently increased its GPU sales forecast, just a year after launching its line of AI chips. But its GPU market share is still far behind Nvidia's. Bank of America said AMD could still succeed in the AI chip market, in part due to Nvidia's supply constraints and premium pricing, making it a strong alternative, especially for internal cloud workloads. It also said AMD is well positioned in the server chip market, as rival Intel continues to struggle. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: China Probes Nvidia Amid Escalating A.I. Chip Tensions With US: What to Know

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:12:44Z

Just two weeks after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang lauded China’s contributions to A.I. research in Hong Kong, the Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company amid escalating geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and uncertainties around the incoming Trump administration.

You can opt out anytime. China’s State Administration of Market Regulation is looking into Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli company that makes computer networking equipment, Chinese media reported today (Dec. 9). China approved Nvidia’s $6.9 billion purchase of Mellanox under the condition that the Israeli company would provide samples of new products to rivals within 90 days of making them available to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg, which noted that China’s approval was needed due to the size of its economy and semiconductor market. The deal also received merger control approval from authorities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico and the European Union. In a statement to Observer, Nvidia said it is happy to answer any questions regulators have about its business. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” said the chipmaker. “We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business.” The investigation is the latest jab in an escalating semiconductor battle between the U.S. and China, which was described by China’s Commerce Ministry as an “abuse of control measures” and a “typical act of economic coercion.” Earlier this month, the Biden administration enacted another round of chip export controls in the country, following previous efforts to curb China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. The country retaliated by banning the export of gallium, germanium, antimony and other superhard materials to the U.S. These materials have various high-tech and military applications. Previous measures from the U.S. have limited Nvidia from selling advanced GPUs to China since 2022. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to maintain these measures and the Biden administration’s tough-on-China stance. Nvidia shares fell more than 3 percent today in response to the news. The past year has been lucrative for the chipmaker, which has seen its stock surging by nearly 200 percent to claim a market cap of $3.38 trillion, making it the world’s second most valuable company behind Apple (AAPL) and boosting the wealth of its founder and CEO to an estimated $120.5 billion. Surging demand for the GPUs underpinning A.I. applications has propelled Nvidia to become the industry leader in A.I. chips, with a 70 percent to 95 percent share of the market, according to Mizuho Securities. The chipmaker, which reported a 94 percent jump in revenue year-over-year to $35 billion during the last quarter, counts tech giants like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) among its largest clients. In China, however, Nvidia has lost ground amid tough export controls. Its sales in the country made up 15 percent of its total sales in the quarter ended September, a dip from 26 percent a year ago. Huang himself has urged for a positive relationship between the U.S. and China when it comes to technological advances, lauding China’s contributions to A.I. research. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” the CEO said while receiving an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology last month.

Title: China levels anti-trust charges against Nvidia – country accuses chipmaker of violating anti-monopoly regulations, examining the $7 billion Mellanox acquisition

Nvidia's stock dipped by 2% as news broke this morning. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As the trade wars escalate between the US and China, Nvidia has found itself in the crossfire following accusations of possible anti-trust violations by the Chinese Government – per local media. The spotlight is on Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox – a conditional approval of which was granted, provided Nvidia would follow strict anti-monopoly guidelines. Following similar inquiries by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) a few months back, Nvidia is now taking flak from both sides. The probe scrutinizes Team Green’s purchase of the Israeli-American networking firm Mellanox in 2020. Mellanox is the backbone of Nvidia's AI servers, allowing multiple GPUs within a DGX system to be connected via InfiniBand and Ethernet switches. The $7 billion acquisition was approved by Chinese authorities, stipulating that Nvidia will not use this partnership to discriminate against domestic firms. Likewise, Nvidia was obligated to notify rivals about upcoming products within 90 days. Coming hot on the heels of another wave of sanctions on 140 Chinese companies—now prohibited from importing High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) among other chip-making tools—a retaliatory response was expected. This appears to be part of China’s strategy to fight back against US sanctions, with recent reports suggesting a 20% price cut on domestic goods to counteract Trump’s tariffs. When asked to comment on the matter by PCMag, Nvidia said, "Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." Since the news broke, Nvidia's stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) plummeted by 2% in pre-market trading early in the morning. These regulations are not mere formalities, as evidenced by their impacts on many multi-trillion dollar corporations. Google, for example, is under serious pressure from the DoJ and could be forced to sell off Google Chrome for $20 billion over complaints of monopolistic practices. Nonetheless, it could take months or even years before a conclusion is reached, giving Nvidia some breathing space. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.08%) shares fell by almost 3% during mid-day trading on Monday after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker. Fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.89%) and Marvell (MRVL+4.38%) also saw their shares fall by 4.4% and 5.2%, respectively. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday it has launched an investigation into the U.S.-based chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws with its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, according to China Central Television. Nvidia bought the chip designer for $6.9 billion in 2020 and was given conditional approval by Chinese authorities that included a requirement to not bundle or tie together its products with Mellanox. The two chip companies were also required to continue supplying on fair terms and to make sure technology was compatible with chips manufactured by Chinese firms. Other measures were designed to address tightening U.S. export controls targeting China’s chip firms. In September, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT+1.26%) were accused by Texas-based startup Xockets of monopolistic practices, patent infringement, and violating federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleges that Nvidia has infringed on Xockets’ patents since its acquisition of Mellanox, which had adopted the startup’s technology in 2016 without its knowledge or permission. The lawsuit accuses Nvidia and Microsoft of infringing on Xockets’ patent for advanced data processing units, or DPUs, “that enable accelerated computing and artificial intelligence” in data centers. Meanwhile, the Biden administration recently announced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said. Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were also added to the U.S. trade blacklist.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say

Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN+2.36%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+8.94%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT+1.26%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+5.89%) and Block (SQ+4.43%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK+0.78%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

Title: Nvidia stock slides as China opens antitrust probe against AI chip heavyweight

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped 2.5% on Monday after China opened an antitrust investigation into the chip giant amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over artificial intelligence dominance. The probe is aimed at Nvidia's practices regarding possible anti-monopoly violations. It is also set to examine its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, a purchase that was approved by China's State Administration for Market Regulation under the condition that the chipmaker avoid discriminating against Chinese companies. According to a Chinese media report, the government believes Nvidia’s $7 billion purchase of the Israeli computer networking equipment maker may have violated Beijing's anti-monopoly rules. In a statement released on Monday morning, an Nvidia spokesperson wrote, "We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The probe comes about a week after the Biden administration implemented another round of semiconductor export restrictions aimed at limiting China's access to advanced chips. The latest US measures include curbing high-bandwidth memory chips shipped to China, crucial components for AI training. “As China continues to struggle to keep up with the most leading-edge AI chips, they probably want to do what they can to slow US firms down," Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning (video above). The Chinese probe against the most important US chipmaker also comes ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House next month. Trump has threatened increased tariffs as part of his policy. "This isn’t just a regulatory issue; it’s a calculated geopolitical manoeuvre," Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, wrote on Monday. "China is sending a strong message that it won’t hesitate to push back, and Nvidia’s targeting is a harbinger of more aggressive measures to come." Nvidia shares have not participated in the overall Trump post-election rally over the past month. The stock is up slightly more than 1% since Trump's win. Nvidia stock is up almost 190% so far this year. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

US stocks struggled for a foothold on Monday as Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped amid a Chinese antitrust probe while investors looked ahead at this week's expected inflation data that will set the stage for the Federal Reserve's final interest-rate decision of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose slightly, coming off a losing week for the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2%, in the wake of fresh records for both. The next test for Wall Street stocks comes in a consumer inflation report, seen as influential to the Federal Reserve's looming policy decision. The November Consumer Price Index on Wednesday will stress-test widespread expectation for a quarter-point rate cut on Dec. 18, after the latest monthly jobs report failed to shake that conviction. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares slipped after China opened a probe into the chipmaker for potential breaches of its anti-monopoly laws. The company's lead in AI chips has put it in the middle of the US-China wrangles over tech. But US-listed Chinese stocks popped after Beijing made its first move toward loosening monetary policy in over a decade, signaling more and bolder stimulus is on the way. Shares in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) and XPeng (XPEV, 9868.HK) were among the premarket gainers, after stocks in Hong Kong jumped. Markets appear to be taking the abrupt fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria in stride, with haven asset gold (GC=F) rising modestly.

Title: AMD Tumbles 2% Pre-Market After BofA Downgrade and AI Market Warnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just got a reality check from Bank of America. The firm downgraded the chipmaker from Buy to Neutral, slashed the price target from $180 to $155, and trimmed its 2025 earnings forecast by up to 8%. Why? Two words: fierce competition. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI accelerator market with an 80%+ share, while AMD scrambles to hold onto a meager 4%. Even Amazon, one of AMDs biggest cloud customers, is cozying up to NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell. Add a potential slowdown in PC demand next year, and AMDs near-term outlook looks dicey. But its not all doom and gloom. AMD has been making some serious power moves, like acquiring Silo AI and ZT Systems to solidify its AI strategy. In Q3, its Data Center segment revenue soared 122%, fueled by deals with heavyweights like Microsoft and Meta. AMDs low debt and $4.5 billion in cash give it a safety net, while its long-term plans to generate over $5 billion in GPU revenue in 2024 keep investors intrigued. And lets not forget: AMDs still the go-to for killer CPUs and GPUs, even if gaming and embedded segments had a rough quarter. The majority of Wall Street analysts are still screaming Strong Buy, with an average price target of $190thats a juicy 37% upside from here. But year-to-date, AMD is only up 3.3%, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQs (^IXIC) 34.5% rally. The takeaway? AMDs long-term AI potential is massive, but near-term risks are real. This is a stock for investors who like their opportunities bigand their risks bigger. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Subscribe to receive notifications of new posts: 2024-12-09 Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users' needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflareâs observations and a review of the yearâs DNS trends. Building on similar reports weâve done over the past several years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2024, with the same categories included in 2023, including Generative AI. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on: Generative AI Social Media Ecommerce Video Streaming News Messaging Metaverse & Gaming Financial Services Cryptocurrency Services As we have done since 2022, our analysis uses anonymized DNS query data from our 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, used by millions globally. We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesnât always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service â it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank. This part of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News. This year, weâre also including a by-country/region perspective on the most popular Internet services for the first time, showing the Top 10 Overall for 132 countries/regions. At the bottom of this post, we highlight trends found in this localized data, including how ChatGPT performed best in Singapore. Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year. For more, visit our 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsite. Along with the lists of most popular Internet services, the Year in Review microsite and its associated blog post explore a number of additional metrics. Since 2021, weâve started our review of rankings with an Overall Top 10 list, showcasing the most popular Internet services globally based on DNS traffic from our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (including services like Google Maps and Google Calendar) remained the #1 Internet service in 2024. Since introducing our ranking method two years ago, no other service has come close to challenging Googleâs top spot. Itâs important to note that Apple and Microsoft are similar to Google in that their main domains (apple.com or microsoft.com) are used for many different services. We include other services separately, such as Outlook or iCloud, which use their own specific domains. Google Facebook Apple TikTok Amazon Web Services Microsoft Instagram YouTube Amazon WhatsApp Beyond Google, Facebook consistently held the #2 spot throughout 2024. Last year, it competed with Apple for that position. Apple, which uses domains like apple.com for services related to its software and devices, was generally #3. However, TikTok challenged that position on several days since late August. Amazon Web Services (AWS), differentiated from Amazon by domains like amazonaws.com, performed better this year compared to 2023. It held the #5 spot but often traded places with Microsoft during the year. Instagram also rose in the rankings. It was around #8 in 2023 and steadily improved. Now, it holds the #7 spot, ahead of YouTube. Amazon remained at #9 for most of the year, the same as in 2023. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, appeared in the Top 10 for the first time, taking the #10 spot. Close to the Top 10 were Appleâs iCloud, Netflix (which performs better on weekends), and Microsoftâs Outlook. In the chart below, you can follow the evolution of the top Internet services in our Overall ranking throughout the year. In 2022, X (then known as Twitter) ranked as high as #10 in our overall ranking and was close to Instagram. It never reached the top 10 in 2023, and in 2024, X dropped further, to #14 or #15. More on Xâs performance in the Social Media category below. Generative AI gained global attention in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, and became a global phenomenon during 2023. By 2024, ChatGPT (OpenAI) continues to be by far the most popular service in this category, which includes chatbots, coding bots, and more. Other generative AI services had more stable rankings compared to 2023. ChatGPT (OpenAI) Character.AI Codeium QuillBot Claude (Anthropic) Perplexity GitHub Copilot Wordtune Poe Tabnine Significant changes occurred below ChatGPTâs first place ranking throughout the year. Character.AI, an AI-driven chatbot platform, maintained a strong #2 position, staying ahead of Codeium, a code-generation AI tool that has improved its position since June, and Quillbot, an AI writing and paraphrasing tool. Claude, the AI chatbot from Anthropic, rose in the rankings, particularly after March 4, when the new model, Claude 3, was introduced, and again later in May when it became available in Europe. It reached #5 in June. Perplexity, an AI-driven search and Q&A platform, started the year outside the Top 10 but ended close to Claude. It surpassed Claude for the first time on November 6, 2024, the day after the U.S. elections, reaching #6. This next chart shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year. Several new players entered the Top 10 AI rankings in 2024, showing strong growth. GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November, as the next chart shows. Similarly, Suno AI, an AI-powered audio and music generation platform, entered the Top 10 in April, briefly dropped out, but stabilized between #6 and #10 after October â in November, it ranked #6 on weekends. Some platforms lost ground in the rankings. Wordtune, an AI writing assistant, peaked at #4 during mid-year but declined afterward. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. In contrast, Sider AI, a coding assistant, entered the Top 20 in March and finished the year around #12. Poe, an AI chatbot platform, ranked #5 in 2023 and between #5 and #6 before June, but ended 2024 moving around #10, performing better during weekends. Google Gemini, Googleâs AI assistant and model, performed better on weekdays and started the year ranking between #7 and #10, but dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face, an open-source AI and machine learning platform, mostly fluctuated between #7 and #9 during the year, peaking at #4 on August 18 around the time several models were updated, and and as it reached its milestone of 5 million users. However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September. Midjourney, an AI-powered platform for generating images, performed well until June, when it was close to the Top 10. Additionally, the OpenAI API ranked #18 in the Generative AI category on May 14-15, coinciding with OpenAIâs announcement of GPT-4o availability, including in the API. Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services within our larger Overall ranking include: ChatGPT continued its growth in 2024, similar to 2023. In early 2023, it ranked around #200 and ended the year near the top 100. In 2024, it started close to the top 100, reached the top 60 in May with the release of the 4o model, and has been near the top 50 since September, aligning with the return of workers and students to their routines. It ranks higher on weekdays, averaging #56, and drops on weekends. Comparing ChatGPT with other known and non-AI related websites, by late November, ChatGPT ranked ahead of Weather.com, Temu, eBay, Telegram, Google Calendar, and Prime Video, but trailed Disney Plus Character.ai also showed a clear growth trend in our Overall ranking, from outside the top 200 earlier in the year, to above #180 after July, performing better in August, reaching as high as #161. The AI-driven chatbot platform performed better on weekends than on weekdays, the opposite of ChatGPT. Codeium entered the top 300 in July. It ranked higher on weekdays than weekends. According to Kepios, there are an estimated 5.22 billion social media users worldwide in 2024 (up from 4.95 billion last year), representing 63.8% of the global population. Social media continues to play a major role in daily life, serving as a key platform for communication, information, and attention. Once again, social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram dominate, ranking among the top 10 most popular Internet services overall. Facebook TikTok Instagram X Snapchat LinkedIn Discord Kwai Pinterest Reddit In the Social Media category rankings, the top seven remain unchanged from last year. However, there are notable developments in this category. In 2022, X briefly challenged Instagram for the #3 spot during a few days. Since 2023, X has held a solid #4 position, with Snapchat closing in and reaching #4 for the first time on several days in September and October. LinkedIn stayed steady at #6, followed by Discord. Kwai, a Chinese video app popular in Brazil (with 60 million reported users) and other countries (a reported ), rose from #10 last year to #8. Further down the list, Pinterest kept its #9 rank, while Reddit, previously #8 in 2023, dropped to #10 this year, but peaked at #7 on November 26, just before Black Friday and Thanksgiving in the US. Hereâs the Social Media Top 10 chart for 2024: Our global ranking also highlights several non-Western platforms in the Top 20. These include Douyin (#11), the Chinese version of TikTok; VK (#12), often referred to as the Russian Facebook; and TikTok rivals popular in Southeast Asia SnackVideo (#13) by Chinese Kuaishou (that also owns Kwai). OnlyFans appeared consistently in the Top 20 starting in September, ranking around #18 and surpassing Tumblr by late November. The #18 spot was briefly held by X alternative Threads (by Instagram) in late September and by Bluesky starting November 18. Mastodon-related servers reached as high as #19 for several days since late August. Hereâs a look at X (on top) and its alternatives in this category: Letâs move beyond the Social Media category to see how these platforms performed in our Overall ranking, where bigger shifts between services are evident. As weâve seen, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (via an aggregation of popular servers) didnât break into the Top 10 of the Social Media category. However, in the Overall ranking, Mastodon servers, bundled together, consistently ranked between #208 and #248, performing better on weekends. Bluesky entered the Top 250 in September 2024, and gained additional attention after the US elections. It rose sharply after November 14, peaking at #193 on November 20, and has since stabilized around #220.Â Threads entered the Top 250 in August 2024, peaking at #183 on September 24 before dropping out in October. In 2023, Threads peaked at #227 in early July but fell out of the Top 250 by late August. Itâs worth noting that Threads also uses Instagramâs cdninstagram.com for images and videos, which may influence Threads position in our DNS rankings (that said, Instagram wasnât impacted by Threads appearance in our rankings). Here are some other trends we observed among social media apps, and how they did in our Overall ranking: Instagramâs best day (#6 in the Overall ranking) was August 5, 2024, coinciding with the week the app was banned in Turkey. Xâs best day of the year in our ranking was April 14, when it reached #12. This coincided with Arsenal losing the top position in the English football/soccer Premier League (the most-watched sports league in the world) to Manchester City, which went on to win its fourth title in a row. Last year, we noted how football/soccer in England impacted Xâs ranking. X also reached #13 on August 9 and 10, during the final weekend of the Paris 2024 Olympics. X performed better on weekdays, while LinkedIn ranked higher between Mondays and Wednesdays. Snapchat and Discord performed better on weekends. Reddit consistently stayed in our Top 50 in 2024, showing growth from around #45 to #40 by November, with a peak at #38 on November 26. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays. Quora displayed a downward trend in our ranking, dropping from around #140 to #160. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays.Â Tinder, which performs better on Sundays, started the year around #150 but eventually dropped below #160. Tumblr followed a similar pattern, dropping out of the Top 200, where it was in early 2024, to outside the ranking entirely since September. Tumblr performed better on weekends. OnlyFans showed growth in our Overall ranking, sitting around the Top 220 with a peak at #213 on December 1. It performed better on weekends. The importance of e-commerce continues to grow, as highlighted in our recent Cyber Week 2024 blog post. Amazon leads the category, followed by Taobao, the Chinese marketplace, holding a steady #2 spot as it also did in 2023. New to #3 is AliExpress, the global online retail giant from China. Amazon Taobao AliExpress Shopify Temu Alibaba eBay Shein Mercado Libre Wildberries (RU) Compared to 2023, eBay lost its #3 spot globally and dropped down to #7, despite starting 2024 at #3 for several days. AliExpress claimed #3, followed by Shopify (#4), the Canadian platform hosting numerous online stores, and Temu (#5). Temu, the low-cost, fast-fashion marketplace launched in the US in September 2022, ended 2023 at #7 but rose to #5 in 2024, occasionally reaching #4 since August. Alibaba dropped to #6 in September. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, continued its growth and overtook Mercado Libre (#8) in November. A surprise this year was Wildberries, often called Russiaâs âAmazon,âÂ that has been expanding to several neighboring countries (including some in Europe). It climbed to #10 in September, surpassing OLX (which held #10 for several months), Rakuten, and Lazada. Looking at how e-commerce sites performed in our Overall ranking, we observed the following trends: Amazon fluctuated between #9 and #10 after October, returning to #9 on November 30 and December 1, during the Black Friday weekend. It often performed better on weekends. Shopifyâs best day of the year was Black Friday, November 29, when it reached #55. The global e-commerce platform performed better during weekdays. Temu, known for low-cost products, started 2024 outside the Top 100 but climbed into the Top 70 by year-end. It performed best in late October and early November, peaking at #63, with a Black Friday spike to #65. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, showed growth, nearing the Top 100 in early 2024 before dropping to the Top 140 between June and October. It rebounded in November, peaking at #83 on Black Friday. A similar trend was observed in 2023, when it ended the year around the Top 120. Hereâs the comparison between recent players Temu and Shein: eBay consistently ranked between #72 and #80, peaking at #62 on October 5-6 and again in late November, just before Black Friday. It often performed better on weekends. Mercado Libre, the Latin American marketplace, had its best day on Black Friday, November 29, reaching #100. Adidas entered the Top 250, ranking #232 on Black Friday, November 29. Target performed well in November, peaking at #133 on November 27, the day before Thanksgiving in the US, and at #127 on December 1. It often performed better on Sundays. Walmart improved its performance from September onward, with its best days on November 25-26, reaching #150. Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, peaked at #247 on June 29. The relevance of video streaming platforms shows no signs of fading. In 2024, the Top 3 rankings stayed unchanged from 2023, with YouTube firmly holding the #1 spot, followed by Netflix. Among paid streaming services, Netflix leads, trailed by Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Other paid streaming services are outside the Top 10, including, in ranked order: HBO/Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Paramount Plus. YouTube Netflix Twitch Roku Disney Plus Amazon Prime Video Vimeo Plex.TV Pluto TV Â Bigo Live Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gaming, kept the #3 spot, as it did in 2023 and 2022. Roku, a digital media player that also offers streaming services, ranked #4, maintaining its position from last year. Similarly, Disney Plus (#5) and Amazon Prime Video (#6) held their spots, while Hulu dropped out of the Top 10. The creative video platform Vimeo showed clear popularity growth since May, followed by recent players like Plex TV, a media platform with streaming that performed better starting in October, and Pluto TV, a free ad-supported streaming service that also showed growth throughout the year. Bigo Live, a live-streaming social platform, entered the Top 10 rankings in May.Â Next, the Top 10 overtime perspective: Throughout the year, Disney Plus occasionally challenged Roku, especially on weekends, a trend similar to what was observed in 2023. Looking at how video streaming services performed in our Overall ranking, we found: Netflix consistently ranked #12 on most weekends, particularly Sundays, through late May and resumed the same trend after August. Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO/Max were more popular on weekends, especially Sundays. Disney Plus ranged between #50 and #60, with a strong start to the year and a spike to #51 on September 22, coinciding with the premiere of the new Marvel show Agatha All Along. Prime Video had its best day in the rankings on May 25, at #56, the day the movie Bombshell with Nicole Kidman premiered on the platform. HBO/Max was consistently around the Top 100 until August. but dropped out after October. Peacock had an inconsistent presence in the Top 250 but reappeared in late July during the Paris 2024 Olympics, reaching #176 on July 28. That was one of the busiest days for Olympic events, as detailed in our blog post on the event. Paramount Plus was mostly outside the Top 250 this year but peaked at #216 on February 11, the day of the Super Bowl, which the platform streamed. News organizations are vital for keeping the public informed, especially during crises. With that in mind, this ranking of news services, some of which are well-established news outlets while others are news aggregators, also highlights a few newsworthy trends. Globo BBC NY Times CNN Fox News Google News Yahoo Finance Daily Mail RT NewsBreak This yearâs rankings in the news category mirrored 2023 at the top. Globo, the Brazilian media giant â one of the largest in Latin America and globally â encompassing radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines, stayed #1, followed by the British BBC at #2, that operates globally and in 42 languages.Â The New York Times rose to #3 this year (it was #5 in 2023), overtaking CNN (#4) and Fox News (#5), which dropped from its position at #3 in 2023 and this year came behind CNN. Several prominent outlets, such as the Washington Post, The Guardian, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal, fell out of the Top 10 this year. These outlets had higher rankings in late 2023 following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict on October 7. News aggregators gained prominence, with Google News (#6) and also Yahoo Finance (#7), focused on financial news (and that came in front of Yahoo News), and NewsBreak (#10), a US-based local news app, entering the Top 10.Â The British Daily Mail, which has also expanded its focus to the US and Australia, ranked #8, followed by RT, the Russian news TV network with a global presence. RT launched its Brazil/Portuguese version in late 2023 and was recently highlighted in a report and an alert from the US Department of State regarding its global operations. The US elections impacted rankings. CNN climbed to #2 on November 5, election day, and reached #1 on November 6, while Fox News peaked at #3. NBC News also improved, reaching #11 on November 5 and #7 the following day. Associated Press ranked #8 on November 5 as well. Hereâs the News ranking: Notable news trends we identified in our larger Overall ranking include: As weâve seen in the News category, the US elections on November 5, 2024, caused CNN, Fox News, and others to jump in our rankings. This trend was also evident in the Overall ranking for the following media outlets, listed by performance. November 6 was the best day of 2024 for each: CNN: #105 on November 5; #72 on November 6 Fox News: #153 on November 5; #92 on November 6 BBC: #115 on November 5, and #97 on November 6 NY Times: #149 on November 5; #98 on November 6 NBC News: #160 on November 6 Associated Press: #166 on November 6 Google News: #250 on November 5; #228 on November 6 Wall Street Journal: #241 on November 6 Washington Post: #245 on November 6 In the next chart we show rankings for CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and NY Times: Brazil made headlines in late February when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters protested to defend the former president against investigations. During this period, Globo moved up the rankings, reaching #60 on February 24-25, 2024. WP, the news aggregator from Poland, had its best day on July 26 (#188), coinciding with Polish lawmakers voting to allow security forces to use lethal weapons with âimpunityâ, particularly at the tense border with Belarus. WP peaked again on November 6 (#180), the day after the US elections, when the result of the election was mentioned in Polandâs parliament. Its third and final peak was on Black Friday, November 29, again at #180. Rambler, the Russian news aggregator, peaked at #218 on February 23, 2024, the day after the Moscow concert hall attack and the same day Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. Messaging remains relevant, especially for specific communication purposes. Appleâs iMessage is excluded from this category because it lacks a unique domain name for traffic analysis. With that in mind, WhatsApp retained its position as the top messaging service in 2024, consistent with 2023 and 2022. WhatsApp QQ Telegram Viber WeChat Signal LINE KakaoTalk eitaa.com Facebook Messenger Following WhatsApp at #2 is, for the second year in a row, the Chinese service QQ, also known as Tencent QQ, which includes games and mobile payments and is popular in Asia. Telegram, widely used in Eastern Europe and Asia, took the #3 spot from Viber in June. Viber remains popular in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. WeChat rose this year, securing #5 in October and surpassing Signal, which held that position for most of the year but dropped to #6 (the same position in which it ended 2023). LINE from Japan ranked #7, while new entries to the Top 10 included South Koreaâs KakaoTalk (#8) and Iranâs eitaa.com (#9), a messaging application, designed for both mobile and desktop platforms, that is popular in Iran and among the Farsi (Persian) language diaspora. Facebook Messenger rounded out the Top 10 at #10. Here are other messaging trends from our Overall ranking: WhatsApp, as noted, performed better this year, growing in popularity since late July, stabilizing at #9 by mid-October, and performing better during weekdays. Telegramâs best days were between July 16-18, during developments in the Ukraine war, including the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaving Crimea. Telegram is widely used by thousands of Russian âwar correspondents,â as recently reported. Eitaa, the Iranian cloud-based messaging app, peaked at #185 in our Overall ranking on April 14, 2024, the day of Iranian strikes against Israel, which we covered in a blog post on Internet trends. WeChat spiked in our Overall ranking (#116) on July 30, 2024, coinciding with Chinese leaders pledging to tilt stimulus efforts towards consumers. Gaming and metaverse both involve immersing players in other worlds. Leaving concepts aside, weâve grouped gaming and the metaverse into the same category since 2022. Roblox dominated this category again in 2024, retaining its top spot, followed by Microsoftâs Xbox at #2. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, ranked third. Roblox Xbox/Xbox Live Epic Games/Fortnite Steam PlayStation Electronic Arts Blizzard Riot Games/League of Legends Minecraft Garena Xbox/Xbox Live held #2 consistently, but Epic Games/Fortnite contested the position earlier in the year and again in November. Steam was a surprise this year, jumping to #4, ahead of PlayStation. It even rose to #2 in late March and early April, coinciding with the launch of a new demo. Other platforms on the rise included Electronic Arts, Blizzard, and Riot Games/League of Legends. Minecraft made the Top 10 at #9, performing best on July 5, 6, and 10, when it reached #7. Garena, the Singaporean game developer and publisher, entered the Top 10 for the first time. Oculus, Metaâs VR headset and metaverse service, dropped out of the Top 10 to #11, after ending 2023 at #5. It performed better earlier in the year (until April) and in late November. Hereâs the top chart across 2024: Here are other metaverse and gaming trends from our Overall ranking: Robloxâs best day in 2024 was January 21, when it reached #20. The platform performed better on weekends, especially Sundays, similar to other popular gaming platforms like Xbox/Xbox Live, Epic Games/Fortnite, Steam, and PlayStation. Epic Games/Fortniteâs best day was January 1, 2024. Xbox/Xbox Live (#37) and PlayStation (#43) had their best day on November 2, 2024, the day before the launch of the new version of the classic game Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge. Steamâs best day was August 24, 2024, during the week of Gamescom 2024 in Germany. Several new games were released that week, including Tactical Breach Wizards and Dustborn. Minecraft, celebrating its 15th anniversary in May 2024, had its best days on June 15 (#90), following the release of the Tricky Trials game update by Mojang Studios, and August 17 (#90), coinciding with the release of Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot 24w33a. Financial services cover everything from traditional banking to cryptocurrencies and tax tools. Stripe, the Irish-American payment platform, kept its #1 spot for the second year, after overtaking PayPal in this category in 2023. Stripe TradingView Alipay PayPal Nubank (BR) Binance Coinbase Banco do Brasil Bradesco Bank Itau PayPal spent only a few days at #2 and a few others at #3 this year, but ultimately dropped to #4. TradingView, a platform specializing in tools for traders and investors, climbed to #2, followed by AliPay, the Chinese mobile and online payment platform, which secured #3. Nubank, the Brazilian neobank (only online) and considered to be the most valuable, one of the biggest Latin America financial groups and the world's biggest digital bank, entered the Top 10 at #5, while Binance rose to #6 (up from #8 last year). Binance also peaked at #3 on November 12-13, following the US elections, as Bitcoin reached new highs. In the crypto space, Coinbase joined the Top 10 for the first time. Brazilâs growth in online banking, digital banks, and payments in Latin America has driven traditional banks to expand their digital presence. In 2024, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and ItaÃº performed well and rose into the Top 10, moving more than ever to the online space including in partnership with each other (as detailed in these two (1), (2) articles in Portuguese). And hereâs the crypto perspective in this Financial services category: Next, we highlight other financial services trends from our Overall ranking: Stripeâs best days were just before Black Friday, on November 18-19 and November 25, reaching #81 during those days. Stripe performed better on weekends and maintained consistent rankings throughout the year. PayPal ranked higher around Black Friday week, peaking at #89 on November 21 and on Black Friday, November 29. Brazilian bank Nubank performed best a few days before Carnival in Brazil (February 10-14), reaching #87 on February 1 and 3 and #92 on February 10. It also ranked well on Black Friday, November 29, peaking at #90. In addition to our Financial Services category, we evaluated cryptocurrency-related services specifically. Despite a few crashes over recent years, the crypto sector continued to evolve in 2024, experiencing a late-year boom, as we explore below. Binance and Coinbase retained the top two spots, while OKX climbed to #3 this year. Binance Coinbase OKX 2miners.com CoinMarketCap Coingecko Bybit Exodus Tonkeeper NiceHash CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data platform, dropped to #6, making way for OKX in late August, while new entrant 2miners.com rose to #4. CoinMarketCap ranked #5, followed by several dynamic new entrants in the Top 10: Bybit (#7): A cryptocurrency exchange offering spot and derivatives trading. Exodus (#8): A user-friendly, multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. Tonkeeper (#9): A secure wallet for managing Toncoin and related assets. NiceHash, a platform connecting cryptocurrency miners and buyers, performed better in 2023, but dropped from #5 to #10 this year. The US elections also had an apparent effect on the Overall ranking: Binance entered the Top 100 for the first time on September 26, when Bitcoin surged past $65,000, driven by positive US employment data and Chinaâs announcement of economic stimulus measures. It peaked at #97 on November 13, following the US elections and Donald Trumpâs victory, as Bitcoin's price surpassed $90,000 for the first time. Coinbaseâs best day was November 21, reaching #131, as Bitcoin approached $100,000 (which it surpassed on December 4, although our ranking only covers up to December 1). OKX peaked at #149 on November 22, and CoinMarketCap reached #176 on November 23. CoinGeckoâs best day was November 11, the week following the US elections, when it climbed to #137. Outside the categories we reviewed as part of the Year in Review, several notable trends emerged in our Overall ranking: The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (July 26âAugust 11, 2024) appeared in our Top 250 Overall ranking, with Olympics-related sites debuting on July 27 (#195), the first full day of events. The peak was on July 30 (#177), driven by LÃ©on Marchandâs swimming performances and the US womenâs artistic gymnastics medal, as detailed in our Olympics blog post. The final day in the Top 250 was August 11 (#217). Spotify ranked between #17 and #18 this year, performing best in October, spending most of the month at #17. However, as our list ends on December 1, we are not tracking the impact of the recently launched Spotify Wrapped. Tesla entered the Top 250 after October. Its best day was October 12 (#245), following the Cybercab robotaxi reveal. It also ranked higher on November 17 (#246), after a post-US elections stock rally. GitHubâs best day was November 8 (#31), coinciding with its announcement of enhanced security protocols, including mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for organizations. NBA appeared in the Top 250 until early March, with its best day on February 4, during these games. Nike ranked only once, on March 26 (#236), during the annual Air Max Day celebration. Brazilâs official Judiciary site peaked at #105 on October 6, during the first round of municipal elections. Ticketmaster peaked at #169 on October 8, during a major service disruption, followed by October 9 (#170), the day Australian F1 tickets went on sale. Intuitâs best day was April 15 (#121), US Tax Day, consistent with previous years. Weather.com peaked at #61 between August 4â6, during Hurricane Debbyâs landfall in Florida. The best day for IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) was January 1 (#220). Example.com, a domain used for documentation purposes, ranked between #24 and #56. Regarding our newly country/region-specific Popular Internet Services overall lists (available on the Year in Review microsite), we observed that Google ranked #1 in nearly all countries. However, there are other notable highlights we feel are worth sharing: TikTok was ranked #1 in Iraq, Kosovo, and Libya, and #2 in over 30 countries/regions across different continents. Examples include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Belarus, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Palestine, Ukraine, Venezuela, and South Africa. Facebook was #1 in Myanmar and #2 in 69 other countries. Myanmar, where the government is known to block several websites, fell to the bottom of Freedom Houseâs Internet freedom ranking this year. Instagram performed well in several countries, ranking among the top five in 18 countries/regions. X showed strong performance in Japan, where it is widely known, ranking #3 in 2024. It also ranked within the top 10 in 23 countries/regions. Reddit did not make the Top 10 in any country but performed best in Iceland (#26) and the United States (#28). Kwai, the social media platform, performed best in Brazil, ranking #7 overall. Snapchat performed well in Iraq and Kosovo (#4) and in Libya, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia (#5).

Nvidia (NVDA) shares moved lower Monday after China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it is investigating the chipmaking giant for potential violations of the country's anti-monopoly laws. The antitrust regulator said Monday that it is looking into Nvidia over the chipmaker's 2020 acquisition of Israeli-American networking hardware maker Mellanox Technologies. SAMR said it "is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law," according to a translation from CNBC. In a statement provided to Investopedia, a company spokesperson wrote, "NVIDIA wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The $6.9 billion deal was announced in March 2019 and completed in April 2020, days after the same Chinese regulators signed off on the deal along with regulators in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Approval for the deal came with the conditions from Chinese regulators that Nvidia wouldn't discriminate against its companies and that Mellanox informed competitors of new products within 90 days of providing them to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg. Shares of the chipmaker that have surged thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom were down about 2% Monday afternoon to $139.61, but still have risen more than 180% since the start of the year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with a statement from Nvidia, additional information, and the latest share price movements.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are America's best-managed companies right now, report says

Apple (AAPL-0.58%) is the best-managed company in the U.S., according to a new ranking by The Wall Street Journal. Of 250 companies, Nvidia (NVDA+3.08%) came in second, followed by Microsoft (MSFT+1.26%), Intel (INTC-0.30%), and Mastercard (MA+1.04%) to round out this year’s top five. The ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute, measures the effectiveness of corporate management using five areas: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength. This year, Apple and Nvidia knocked Microsoft out of the top spot — a position it has held for the last four years. Apple ranked highly for innovation and financial strength. Nvidia also ranked first for financial strength and second in employee engagement. The two companies have competed neck and neck to be the world’s most valuable company. Apple currently has a $3.67 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia is worth $3.49 trillion as of market close Friday. Shares of the chipmaker, which has seen a massive boost from artificial intelligence as demand for its AI chips booms, are up almost 200% this year. That’s compared with 30% for Apple. Microsoft has also seen healthy growth this year, adding almost 20% to its share value for a $3.30 trillion market cap. The company also ranked near the top in innovation and financial strength. Intel, on the other hand, has had a rocky year. Ranked as the fourth best-managed company in the country, Intel ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger last week after he failed to turn around the company’s performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA+0.47%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. Nonetheless, Intel ranked first across all 250 companies in social responsibility, and second in customer satisfaction.

Nvidia (NVDA+3.08%) is under investigation for allegedly violating anti-monopoly laws in China. The country’s State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a probe into whether Nvidia’s acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies violated anti-monopoly laws, according to a report from China Central Television on Monday. Shares of Nvidia fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading on Monday. The leading artificial intelligence chipmaker bought Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2020 after receiving conditional approval from Chinese authorities. Conditions included requirements that Nvidia and Mellanox not bundle or tie together products, continue to supply on fair terms, and ensure that chips from Chinese manufacturers worked with the technology. Other requirements were aimed at maintaining independence between the two firms, and lessening any potential impacts of export controls amid the trade war between the U.S. and China that began in 2018 under the first Trump administration. This comes as chip trade tensions between the two economic superpowers continue to escalate. Last week, the Department of Commerce introduced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said.d Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were added to the U.S. trade blacklist. According to the agency, the curbs are aimed at slowing China’s advanced AI developments that have “the potential to change the future of warfare” and “impairing” China’s development of its chip ecosystem.

Title: China is probing Nvidia in a major escalation of its chip wars with the US | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has opened an antitrust investigation into American chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s largest provider of processors that power artificial intelligence, according to Chinese state media. The probe serves as the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance, which both the United States and China believe is crucial for national security. China Central Television in a report Monday said the Chinese government believes Nvidia’s purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox could violate the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though the report did not specify what the merger did to potentially break the law. China approved the acquisition in 2020. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell less than 2% in premarket trading Monday. The stock is among the hottest on the market, surging nearly 200% this year as the AI boom has fueled demand for the company’s chips. Its market value is more than $3 trillion, second only to Apple. The tit-for-tat China-US chip war has entered a new phase this month, after the Biden administration imposed another round of restrictions on high tech memory chip sales to China a week ago. The memory chips are different than the graphics processors Nvidia makes, but they are also crucial technology that helps power AI. The administration’s new export controls are the third such round of chip sales restrictions to China. The United States fears that China could use AI to gain a military advantage, and US Commerce Department officials said they believed the restrictions would slow China’s development of AI chips — and industry experts believe the US government’s plan will work. But China’s Commerce Ministry lambasted the United States’ restrictions, saying they pose “a significant threat” to the stability of global supply chains. China’s government retaliated last week by banning the sale of materials essential for manufacturing the chips, including germanium and gallium. A year ago, China had curbed the sale of those materials but created loopholes that allowed for some sales to continue. Those have now been closed. Senior US officials have also accused China of stealing American-made AI software, which Beijing denies. The Nvidia investigation ups the ante. The company is the face of the AI tech revolution and hurting Nvidia could harm the American company’s ambitions to continue to power AI around the world. Nvidia is also under antitrust scrutiny in the United States, according to Bloomberg. In addition to curbing materials and chips sales, both China and the United States are trying to bolster their own development and manufacturing of microprocessors at home. Through the CHIPS Act, the Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars into Intel and other companies to boost domestic production of chips and reduce America’s reliance on China and other foreign countries for the technology. Meanwhile, China in May announced plans to set up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund worth $47.5 billion, funded by investments from six of the country’s largest state-owned banks.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

Title: China investigates Nvidia over suspected violation of antimonopoly law

By Liam Mo and Brenda Goh BEIJING (Reuters) -China said on Monday it has launched an investigation into Nvidia over suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. The statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation announcing the probe did not elaborate on how the U.S. company, known for its artificial intelligence and gaming chips, might have violated China's anti-monopoly laws. It said the U.S. chipmaker was also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, under terms outlined in the regulator's 2020 conditional approval of that deal. The announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running trade war between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological superiority. Last week, four of China's top industry associations issued a rare and coordinated response saying that Chinese companies should be wary of buying U.S. chips as they were "no longer safe" and should buy locally instead. Nvidia's shares closed 2.5% lower on Monday. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company worked hard to "provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business," adding that "we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business". TECHnalysis Research chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Reuters that the probe is unlikely to have much of an impact on the company, particularly in the near term, because most of Nvidia’s most advanced chips are already restricted from being sold into China. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Shortly after Washington's announcement, Beijing banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony. Nvidia is one of many companies caught up in U.S.-China friction. U.S. sanctions in 2022 banned shipments of A100 and H100 AI chips to China, leading Nvidia to develop modified versions. These China-specific variants were later restricted under tightened U.S. controls in October 2023, prompting Nvidia to release another set of modified chips for the Chinese market. "It's clear that the Chinese government is trying to react against recent restrictions from the U.S., but their ability to impact the U.S. semiconductor industry continues to decrease over time," O'Donnell said. Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with a more than 90% share before those curbs. However, it faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. China accounted for around 17% of Nvidia's revenue in the year to the end of January, sliding from 26% two years earlier. In 2020, the company won a key approval from China for its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, to the relief of investors who felt Sino-U.S. trade friction could complicate the process. Nvidia and the merged entity were set multiple conditions, requiring them to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory" terms. The companies must also provide customers and distributors the opportunity to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The conditions also prohibit forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately. The last time China launched an anti-monopoly probe into a high-profile foreign technology firm was in 2013, when it investigated Qualcomm's local subsidiary for overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm later agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, which was the largest China had ever handed out to a company at the time.

A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting.

December 09, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from a single and remarkably high-grade diamond drill hole recently completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-347 was a shallow hole drilled at the eastern margin of the historic O’Brien Gold Mine workings. At approximately 200 metres vertical depth it intersected 643.1 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold (“Au”) over 2.1 metres, including 1,345.0 g/t Au over 1.0 metre. The extensive nuggety-gold and high silicification suggest that the hole has intersected the near-surface extension of the famous O’Brien “Jewellery Box”, a mining stope believed to be the source of extremely high-grade and museum quality gold samples. Video of the core is available HERE. Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “When the O’Brien Gold Mine was operational between 1926 and 1957, it was known for very high grades and spectacular specimens of visible gold, many of which are now in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. The source of some of the best specimens was thought to be the Jewellery Box stope, a narrow, vertical grade-shoot extending from 250 metres depth to at least 750 metres depth. At the time, exploration drifts were developed to try to find this zone above the 250 metres level, without success. Now, drill-hole OB-24-347 has intersected what we believe is the same Jewellery Box zone marginally offset to the east. We intend to now trace it to the surface with additional drilling and expose it with stripping. This is being planned for our 2025 exploration program. Steeply plunging high-grade shoots are characteristic of the O’Brien Gold Project. The Jewellery Box Stope was always the best of these. Its potential re-discovery offers very high value, low-hanging fruit for a future O’Brien mine.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-347Matt Manson continued: “Our 2024 drill program of 35,000 metres has comprised a combination of shallower holes, such as with today’s news, and deeper holes exploring the full depth potential of O’Brien gold mineralization. Of note, we have recently completed drill hole OB-24-337, the first hole ever drilled directly below the historic mine and, at 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project. The results from this hole are expected to be released shortly.” Figure 2: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with the Location of OB-24-347 Illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Figure 3: More Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB 24-347. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-347 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Title: What's Happening With JPMorgan Stock?

JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, United ... [+] Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has gained about 48% year-to-date, compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. JPMorgan’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 50% YTD. Let’s take a look at JPM’s recent performance and outlook. JPMorgan outperformed street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024. The bank reported total revenues of $42.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. Net interest income was slightly higher compared to last year, due to changes in the balance sheet mix, higher credit card balances, as well as wholesale deposits. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? Non-interest revenue, excluding the markets segment, grew by a strong 17% led by higher asset management fees as well as an improved investment banking performance. However, net income was down by about 2% compared to last year at $12.9 billion on account of higher provisions for credit losses. As an aside, why is VALE down 40% this year? See What’s Happening With VALE Stock? Admirably, JPM stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and 31% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s the outlook like for JPMorgan? Separately, see why Citi stock is also having a good year in Why Citi Stock Is Up 40% This Year. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as JPMorgan. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. While JPMorgan remains one of the highest quality names in the banking space, with considerable scale, we believe the stock is overvalued. JPM stock trades at over 2.5x tangible book value (company’s net assets, less goodwill) which is elevated in our view. Overall, at its current price of $245 per share, JPM is trading about 15% ahead of Trefis’ estimate for JPMorgan’s valuation.

Title: Computer science grads say the job market is rough. Some are opting for a 'panic' master's degree instead.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/computer-science-major-panic-masters-degree-graduate-school-job-market-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-09T09:13:01Z
Full Content:
A computer science degree has become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking a six-figure job in Big Tech out of college. However, as the tech industry took a sharp turn from pandemic hiring sprees to more recent mass layoffs, conversations with over a dozen CS majors revealed many are struggling to find full-time roles and internships despite sending out hundreds of applications. Now, some are opting for a "panic master's" instead, delaying their search by getting a graduate degree in the hopes the job market will improve in a year or two. Samhita Parvatini, who graduated from Penn State University in May, told Business Insider that she entered college during the hiring frenzies of 2021 when computer science degrees were "highly sought out." "Every industry needed engineers," she said. "Everybody said, 'Oh, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. You can earn so much money, you get a lot of success and career growth.'" After sending out 250 to 300 applications since graduating, with little success, Parvatini said the Big Tech landscape felt like it was "becoming the opposite" of what it was five years ago. Software developer employment largely declined between late 2019 and early 2024, according to data from ADP Research Institute, with some spikes in the second half of 2021 and winter 2022 amid the pandemic hiring spree. Data from Indeed indicated job postings in the software development sector have largely dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, videos showing swarms of candidates at job fairs have become increasingly common on social media. Yahya Bashir, a recent CS graduate from Gustavus Adolphus College, said that his job-hunting experience in the past year has become more arduous. During his last application cycle in summer 2023, Bashir said he often heard back quickly from companies and was invited to several interviews. However, the majority of the roles he applied to this year, which he estimates to be about a hundred, didn't reply. "Most of them, you don't even hear back from them," Bashir said. "You submit your application, and there's just nothing." Facing low response rates and, in some cases, "ghost job" postings, software engineers fresh out of school are also having to compete with their more experienced peers. With companies continuing to trim their staffs, the tech sector has also faced two years of brutal layoffs. In 2022, over 165,000 employees were cut from 1,000 tech companies, per Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks tech layoffs. In 2023, the number of layoffs increased to over 264,000. So far in 2024, nearly 150,000 employees have been cut from over 520 tech companies. With hundreds of thousands of already established tech workers cut loose into the job market, new graduates are facing increased competition for fewer openings. Emos Ker, a recent graduate from New York University, said that although sub-industries within computer science, like AI and LLM, are booming as Big Tech invests heavily, these fields often require a higher level of training. Although more universities like Carnegie Mellon and Columbia University are starting to offer AI degrees and programs, Ker said that many institutions are not yet able to provide the specific education needed for more specialized fields like AI. Looking through a stack of résumés, companies may choose to hire a seasoned Big Tech veteran over a CS graduate who would likely require more guidance. "With all the tech firings, they're looking for people who are like midlevel, senior engineers," Ker said. "And unfortunately, for people like us who want to come out and work in AI, it's not really easy to get into because you kind of need to train us from the ground up." Instead of risking being hung out to dry in the job market, several recent computer science graduates told BI that they or their peers have opted to return to the classroom to delay the search. "The funny thing is, when I started my undergrad, I was very stubborn and was like, 'Oh, I don't need a master's,'" Parvatini said. "'It's a CS degree, you know, it's so valuable." A month out from graduation and without a job lined up, Parvatini said she applied for a master's degree program as a "last-minute decision." "I knew that I wasn't going to go anywhere after graduation," she said. "So I thought, might as well apply, and we'll take a couple of classes, you know, do something better with my time during this period." Professor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon's computer science master's program, said that while the university hasn't seen a notable increase in CS grad enrollment, other schools with less selective and extensive programs may experience otherwise. "It's definitely true that when the economy has a downturn, people go back to education because they're not able to find jobs so quickly," he said. "So there is definitely that trend, overall." Enrollment in MIT's EECS Master of Engineering program increased from 241 students for the 2023-2024 academic year to 303 this academic year — a spike compared to previous years when enrollment stayed relatively consistent in the mid-200s. A report by the Council of Graduate Schools said that computer science was the "only field to increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%) between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022." Ian Hurrel, who is finishing his last semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, said he enrolled in the university's one-year master's program largely because the job market was getting worse. "A lot of people, including me, wanted to stay in college one more year to get an internship," Hurrel said. "It was very much a 'panic master's' sort of thing." Although computer and information sciences often have lower graduate enrollment compared to other fields, a report by Burning Glass Institute indicated that 7% of those who earned graduate degrees in CS remained unemployed. While costly, the additional schooling could buy students time, bolster their résumés, and ultimately lead to better-paying jobs. Data from PayScale published last year found that employees with a Master of Science degree made an average base salary of $112,000, compared to $72,000 for those with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Despite lower morale among some CS majors, others believe that finding employment in the tech sector is not as dire as many people on social media portray it. Sydney Bishop, a senior at UC Irvine, said despite being unable to land an internship this past summer after sending over 180 applications, she remained optimistic about the job market. "I haven't lost faith that I'll get a job somewhere," Bishop said. "It just might not be a cushy tech job that all of us have been raised to think about." While tech giants like Google and Microsoft may not be handing out as many opportunities as they did during their hiring peaks, Bishop said that the technical skills of programming are still — and will continue to be — needed within companies. Hurrel, who was able to land an internship with Amazon this past summer, said that he disagrees with the "fear-mongering" from people online saying computer science is a dying degree. "I don't think it's oversaturated to the point where it will become extremely devalued and not be a worthwhile career anymore," he said. "I think it's just going to be harder than it was at the peak to break into it." Hurrel added that there are "clearly still jobs" and that several of his peers have also been able to land internships and full-time roles. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that by 2033, employment of software developers will increase by 18%. Samuel Onabolu is one of these newly minted engineers. After sending out over 1,000 applications, he said he was finally able to land a full-time software engineering role four months after graduating from Brock University in May. "I'm kind of surprised I even got a job so early because there are 2023 grads, 2022 grads that are still looking," he said. "So I would say it's just a lot about perseverance and a little bit of luck." Onabolu said that while he had been "feeling really depressed" during his unsuccessful job search, he advised other new and incoming grads to prioritize internships and networking events to try to get their foot in the door. "I feel like every CS major is going through the exact process I went through," he said. "I feel like it just takes that one acceptance, that one offer, to kind of break into that career." Jump to

After you're laid off, what comes next? For many tech workers, there's no easy answer. Following historic mass layoffs in 2023 and 2024, tech hiring has slowed and the job market looks increasingly bleak. Laid-off employees face an uncertain future. For a road map on how to move on post-layoff, we spoke to former employees at Google, which cut 6% of its workforce nearly two years ago and has continued making cuts in 2024. Eight ex-Googlers impacted by those layoffs — including one who has since returned to the company — shared what it was like to lose what some considered their "dream job," how they found their footing in the aftermath, and their advice for others facing similar circumstances. Many of the employees Business Insider spoke with said they were caught off guard by their layoff or that they expected only low performers to be impacted. Google said it provided impacted employees with outplacement support and invited them to apply for open roles across the company. Some interviewees told BI they found few openings. Since their layoffs, these former Googlers' paths have varied. One ran for city council; another took a job at Trader Joe's. Some landed jobs at other Big Tech companies, and others launched their own ventures. While many reflected fondly on their time at Google and felt their layoff was a blessing in disguise, others expressed frustration toward Google's leadership. Here are their stories, in their own words. Their quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Gordon is a lawyer by trade who worked at Meta prior to joining Google as a privacy program manager eight months before the 2023 layoffs. I was at a coffee shop with my husband when a news alert popped up on his phone saying that Google was laying off 12,000 people that day. We'd both survived layoffs before — my husband works at Amazon and I'd been at Facebook prior to Google — so layoff news generally didn't startle us; we were used to it. I'm sure it's not me, I thought. But then I tried to log into my computer, and my password was rejected. I very quickly recognized the silver lining of the opportunity. I had six months' severance. I'd never taken a break before — I'd been working like crazy since graduating from law school in 2012. I rested and spent more time with my kids. We took a family vacation. I started doing Pilates and got back into therapy. I used the time as a true sabbatical to reenergize myself for the next phase of my career. After three months, I started applying for jobs. I turned down an offer from a consulting firm because that world didn't feel like the right fit for me. Some big law firms approached me, and I took a contract role at a firm while continuing my job search. I started a new role in data privacy at Cruise, a self-driving car company, the same week my Google severance ended, but a few months later I was laid off again. I dove right back into the job search and have been at Amazon since December. So far, everything is good. People are very nice and welcoming here, and I love my team. I'm eight months pregnant and plan to take maternity leave, but I'll be back to work after that. I also launched a coaching business recently and will be producing a new podcast next year. I have peace around how everything ended up. My advice to people is that if you are going into tech right now, you can't be someone who takes yourself extremely seriously. I have a huge sense of humor, and that gets me through a lot of things. Because my husband and I both work in tech, people assume that we must live large, but we don't. We share a Toyota and live with the knowledge that we are very fortunate to be in jobs we love, but it could all be gone tomorrow. Kim led Google's communications team in Korea for 12 years before moving to its Mountain View headquarters in 2019 to establish its international media team. She was the director of global communications prior to her 2023 layoff. As a longtime Googler who'd been with the company through the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, I felt like I was safe. At first, I thought the layoff email I received was a scam. As reality began to set in, I got really angry; I'd been so loyal to Google. I loved working there and felt so proud to be there. I went through the five stages of grief and wondered, Why me? I got depressed. I'd look at my empty calendar and feel rejected, like nobody wanted me. I began to see how I could use my severance package as an opportunity. I decided to do a "gap year" and wrote out a list of things I'd always wanted to do: work at Trader Joe's, be a barista, work at In-N-Out Burger, drive for Lyft or Uber, pet sit, work as a bartender. It made me feel really rejuvenated. That first weekend, I applied to Trader Joe's. But on my first day, I had trouble walking in the door. I'd been the director at a big company, was a two-time published author, and had been featured on a top Korean talk show; I thought people would look down on me because of the Asian cultural concept of "saving face." It was an internal barrier I had to break through, and I did. By May, I was working three jobs at the same time for up to 70 hours a week — Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and Lyft whenever I had time — plus pet-sitting on an ad hoc basis. I decided to write a book about my experience to motivate other people in the same situation as me. Being laid off is painful — even more so in Korean culture because people don't talk about it. I wanted to be an example and say, "It's not your fault, and you can make full use of your time and then move on." After 18 months, I ended up moving back to Korea to be the chief brand officer at Hanmi Group, a pharmaceutical company. Things have changed a lot in the five years I was away, but I'm using my experience from 30 years in international companies and learning a lot from local companies. I've also found my customer support and marketing experience at Trader Joe's and Starbucks to be helpful. I hope to retire in the US. Trader Joe's has a really good internal transfer system, so I'd love to work for two years in San Francisco, then in Idaho, then in Florida, and so on, so that I can explore the States while making money. I miss a lot about Google, but more about the early days when it felt like a family. The company grew and grew, and we had to lose some parts and focus on efficiency. I did a good job of quickly processing and moving on after my layoff. In hindsight, I wonder why I didn't take a break to travel, but I know I would've been too worried to enjoy it. If I were to share advice with friends going through the same thing, I'd tell them not to feel too anxious, especially about things they can't control. Maybe the future is already ready, even though you don't know it. A senior software engineer who was laid off in January 2024 secured another job at Google a few weeks later. They asked to be kept anonymous to protect their job security. I was really happy at Google. For the most part, I think it strikes the right balance between productivity and work-life balance. I had to take medical leave for depression at another fast-paced Big Tech job I'd worked; at another job, things felt like they moved at a glacial pace. At Google, I didn't feel overwhelmed, yet also felt like I was delivering. It was definitely my favorite place I've worked. Because of my history of depression, I was afraid that I'd go to suicidality if I was laid off, so I worked with my counselor to set up a well-defined game plan. When the layoff actually happened, it felt horrible — my worst fear coming true. If I were early in my career or if my child and wife didn't depend on me as the breadwinner, I probably would've thought, Nice! Good vacation and generous severance. But I was super anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a comparable job in the next four or five months before our cost of living exceeded the severance. I had my résumé already prepped and a contact list of people to reach out to immediately, and I went into cortisol-fueled search mode. I reached out to a lot of connections for referrals and applied everywhere, both internally and externally. I checked the Google internal job posting site every day, but there weren't many open positions. I also applied to every relevant LinkedIn EasyApply position. I spent the rest of my time practicing LeetCode problems and reviewing past projects. A few weeks later I got a response from one of my Google applications and set up a video call. A couple of days later, the manager told me they wanted to bring me on. My biggest priority was securing a job so I accepted, despite having advanced in the interview process at some other companies. The Google role also had some advantages, like maintaining my competitive compensation and giving me an opportunity to develop relevant skills and future-proof my qualifications. Returning to Google, I feel more anxious and find it harder to focus. Before the layoffs, I had a sense of security, like I was in a really good industry that paid well and had lots of mobility. Now, I have this ever-present fear that the industry will shrink and become too competitive, or companies will choose to take efficiency gains from AI to cut costs. And I've lost trust in Google's leadership. The real responsibility for layoffs lies with upper middle management up to leadership, and I feel there's been essentially no accountability. Still, I think coming back to Google was the best risk-averse decision. My plan worked well, and I think I went about things the best I could. Duran worked at Google for almost nine years in various roles, including as the first chief of staff to the VP of operations. She also headed YouTube Mexico during the pandemic. Prior to the 2023 layoff, she was the head of strategy and operations for YouTube's Latin American and Canadian markets. The night before the layoff, I missed dinner with my family to take a strategy call with the creator marketing team based in Singapore. The next morning, I tried to check my work calendar before breakfast and it wouldn't load. People had been nervous about layoffs but thought low performers would be the only ones impacted. That's not what happened. Once I realized my role had been eliminated, I started bawling. I'd given everything to the company, like so many of us, and it wasn't a possibility in my head that I would be laid off. I gave myself the weekend to grieve. One of my best friends visited from Seattle to support me. Three days later, I started a podcast, an idea I'd been playing with for a while. I put my head down and worked on it as if it was a full-time job; I loved it. It was therapeutic. I talked a lot with guests about childhood circumstances and how they influence our careers and decision-making. I came from a working-class background, and after getting an Ivy League education, I saw how easy it was to get sucked into thinking, I can't take this other kind of job because what is it going to say about me? I was fortunate that I had enough severance that it took me pretty much through the end of the year. I became more active on LinkedIn and told people I was looking for a job; before, I'd been a very private person who didn't like asking for help. A friend of a friend, despite not really knowing me, helped pass my résumé on to different leaders at Intuit. I had an informational call with one, and when an opportunity arose within his team, I was able to land the job. I've been really happy here — my manager is really supportive, and we're working on tough, interesting problems. After working at Google for so long and seeing how it ended, I've been thinking about how I spend my time. Even though I love my job now, I haven't let it interfere with my other priorities, like carving out dedicated time for my two kids. I'm also still regularly publishing podcast episodes, and I recently joined a nonprofit board. There were a couple of times when I considered leaving Google but didn't because of fear. My advice for people is to not make career decisions from a place of fear. Stay somewhere because you're passionate, not because you're afraid to try something else. I don't regret that night before I was laid off when I missed dinner with my family to work; I was excited about the project and was trying to be mindful of people in other time zones. But now I know that my layoff decision had already been made at that point, and the company was comfortable having me work really late the night before they were going to lay me off. My advice to people is to make sure that when you're making these trade-offs, you're doing it with clear eyes. Neyer interned at Google during college and returned seven years later as a developer relations engineer, before being laid off in January 2023. When I found out I was laid off, I felt almost a relief and a sense of openness. I suddenly had this blessing of a healthy severance to use to build what I wanted outside of Google. I intermittently job-searched for a few months and almost joined an early-stage startup, but nothing quite landed. I also traveled a bit around the US, did a lot of reading and writing, and participated in a lot of community engagement. I have a thriving community here in Boulder and enjoy being in nature. I also became the executive director of a nonprofit I joined in 2022 called Consciousness Hacking Colorado — now relaunched as Woven Web — focused on facilitating harmony between technology, society, consciousness, and nature. I've begun a second master's degree, this time in creative technology and design at the University of Colorado Boulder's Atlas Institute. I also ran for Boulder City Council. I didn't win, but the city council appointed me to the Human Relations Commission which has been great. We're working on issues of how to address tensions in our community, especially in relation to the Middle East conflict, and how we can bring about better dialogue to address these tensions. I bike past the Google office a lot here in Boulder and often feel a tenderness in my heart. For all of the company's faults, there are many things that it does well, like the beautiful community of people who work there. I don't have too many regrets in life. There are so many pathways, but the one that I'm on feels really beautiful. I'll go back into some form of full-time work at some point, but I'm not rushing to any decisions. For now, I feel stable enough to keep prioritizing learning and creating community, putting a lot of the gifts I received at Google to good use. Eric Wages worked at Google for 15 years in various roles and spent over a decade leading its third-largest data center campus. Before his 2023 layoff, he was the global program manager of the corporate real estate team. I wasn't surprised by the layoff. I could see the tide turning a year in advance; people weren't working in the office, and yet we had many billions of dollars of office construction ongoing. I spent a lot of effort trying to convince leadership to pause construction, but my attempts weren't well-received. I'd been laid off before and knew that layoffs aren't personal. Still, I went through the traditional stages of grief. I'm someone who has to live with a purpose, and my purpose evaporated when I received an impersonal layoff email that Friday morning. I bought a whiteboard, put it behind my desk, and started trying to figure out what my purpose was now: What am I good at? Do I want to ever work for a large company again? I knew I never wanted to work with jerks again — I'm not saying I worked for many of them at Google, but there are many folks who are just a pain. I wanted the flexibility to work with people I enjoyed working with and help them solve problems — that's what I had always enjoyed as a leader. Three months later, I started my own firm, Idealem Solutions Group. It's a mix of technical consulting, coaching, and understanding how people work, focused on data centers. I'm thankful for the layoff, because I'd been in the golden handcuffs. I think I'd be miserable if I were still there today. And as much as I bemoan the golden handcuffs, they've served me well. My 15 years at Google set me up with a wonderful financial backstop, which has allowed me to be picky about how I work and what I charge. Being an independent consultant and business owner is rewarding. When I couldn't find a contractor this summer to fix some things around the house, I was able to not actively seek new clients for a couple of months and just do it myself. It also allowes me to have a better relationship with my wife. While I think Google could have done better with the layoff, there's no good way to lay off 12,000 people. Any manager who's had to terminate someone knows to expect the absolute worst. Multiply that by 12,000 — locking the doors and turning off the badge was, dare I say it, the best way. But one way they could've done better was to ask for volunteers; I would've strongly considered leaving if an offer had been tendered. It was extremely frustrating to see the culture changing after being there for so long. Chen joined Google in 2016 as an account manager for the company's Singapore advertisers and did a three-month rotation with Google's strategy and operations team in Silicon Valley in 2019. Prior to the 2024 layoffs, he was the head of small business ad sales for the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan markets. My last day at Google — my dream job — was on Valentine's Day this year, the day before my 38th birthday. Logically, I knew that industry ups and downs and turnover were pretty normal. Emotionally, though, it was tough. I had been there eight years; that's like an eight-year relationship. My initial reaction was pain and anger, driven by ego. I also compared myself to those who weren't laid off, feeling like I was better or more experienced or more loyal than they were. I had a lot of sleepless nights and went through the grieving process. My wife was extremely supportive. The toughest part was knowing that the next day, the company just moved on. That was sort of a rude awakening. I was given two months to look for other roles internally. I panicked and applied for every job available, hanging on for dear life to the possibility of still being able to call myself a Googler — a huge part of my identity. A couple of senior Google leaders graciously reached out about joining their teams, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy the roles and didn't want to do a bad job. When I turned them down, every part of my body was shaking. I splurged on a solo snowboarding trip to Japan and spent time alone in the mountains. I'd wake up at night crying. There had been so much going on that once I gave my body and mind a bit of peace and space, it automatically went into recovery mode, which was very therapeutic. I posted my first YouTube video in April. I wanted to share my layoff story to bring comfort and courage to others. Many people reached out to me saying things like, "I felt the same way," and "Even my therapist couldn't articulate how I'm feeling as well as you did." It feels like my calling is to help people have a healthier relationship with their careers and money, and my YouTube channel has grown since then. I've also launched a coaching and consulting business and teach at the National University of Singapore. While I don't earn as much as I did working full-time, I make more per hour and have much more flexibility. I also achieved financial freedom several years ago, by growing my income from $80,000 to close to $300,000 at Google, saving and investing at least half of my paycheck, and being very conscious of my spending. I wish I'd been more supportive of people that I used to work with who were laid off before me. While Google was and still is a huge part of my identity, I learned that there are really other parts of my life that I should nurture. Looking back, I'm grateful — I wouldn't have discovered this life was possible if not for the layoff. Ferraz started in sales at Google in São Paolo, Brazil, in 2011 after college, briefly left for another opportunity, and returned as an analytical lead in Google's San Francisco office. Prior to the 2023 layoffs, she was a senior product manager in Google's internal incubator, Area 120. When I woke up that morning and saw the layoff email, I was so out of touch with reality that my first concern was that my team wouldn't be able to access a document I'd been up late working on the night before. It took a bit of time for me to realize, "Wait, I lost my job." I jumped straight into practical things. A friend and former coworker who'd read about the layoffs told me she was hiring, so I jumped out of bed and did an interview, but I could hardly pay attention. I went back to Brazil for a week to be close to my childhood friends. For those of us in tech, it felt like the world was falling apart, but I'm from an island in the south of Brazil, and being there helped me keep that in perspective. I ended up moving to Miami, where a lot of my friends had moved during the pandemic. Climate tech is one of my personal passions, and I took a remote consulting job with a nonprofit biodiversity lab based in Zurich for a few months. On one of my trips to Zurich, I met my now-cofounder. Looking for a cofounder in the months prior was almost like dating — finding the right one was the most challenging part, and now that I have, it feels so right. Together, we incorporated biodiversityX, an AI-powered tech company providing real-time forest analytics, in Zurich. Losing a job is traumatic, but it's humbling to think about how much Google transformed my life. It was such a good place to grow and develop as a leader, and I miss the culture, the food, and the people. Before, I thought a career had to be very linear — one promotion after another; tomorrow needs to be bigger than yesterday. Today, I see things as a bit more fluid and view the layoff as a blessing in disguise. Being an entrepreneur — the degree of responsibility and the speed at which we can move — is so freeing and rewarding. The pieces are coming together, and I'm grateful to Google for being such a great school. Jump to

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/will-amazon-buy-bitcoin-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped nearly 3% in its final hour of trade, after china vowed "more proactive" fiscal measures and "moderately" looser monetary policy next year to boost domestic consumption. The announcement came from an official readout of a key policy meeting that outlined upcoming economic priorities. Prior to the news, mainland China's CSI 300 index fell 0.17% to close at 3,966.57 after China's consumer price growth came in below expectations in November. CPI rose 0.2% year on year, down from a 0.3% increase in October, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. Economists from Reuters forecast price growth of 0.5%. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, markets were mixed as traders assessed revised economic growth data from Japan and South Korea's political situation. South Korea's Kospi stock index fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote over the weekend as the fallout from his brief declaration of martial law continues to roil the country. The benchmark index fell 2.78% to 2,360.58, while the small-cap Kosdaq dropped 5.19% to 627.01 as investors continued to monitor the country's political situation. While Yoon's People Power Party boycotted the Saturday impeachment vote brought by opposition parties, its leader has said that Yoon would step down. Meanwhile, prosecutors in the country have named President Yoon as a subject in a criminal investigation for potential charges of treason and abuse of power, according to local media reports. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.18% to end the trading day at 39,160.5, while the Topix gained 0.27% to 2,734.56. The country's third-quarter gross domestic product was revised to 0.3% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, up from 0.2% and above estimates from a Reuters poll that predicted no change. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended marginally higher at 8,423. In the U.S. on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose to fresh records after November jobs data came in slightly better than expected, but not so hot as to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates again later this month. The broad market S&P 500 climbed 0.25% to 6,090.27. Tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, bolstered by gains in Tesla, Meta Platforms and Amazon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 123.19 points, or 0.28%, to close at 44,642.52. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq went on to their third straight positive week as well, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow slipped 0.6% during the period. — CNBC's Sean Conlon, Lisa Kailai Han and Pia Singh contributed to this report. China's leaders on Monday pledged "more proactive" fiscal measures and "moderately" looser monetary policy next year to boost domestic consumption, according to an official readout of a key policy meeting that outlined upcoming economic priorities. The Politburo, a top decision-making body led by President Xi Jinping, said it will stabilize property and stock markets while strengthening the "unconventional counter-cyclical" adjustment, the Communist Party's CNBC-translated readout said. Read the full story here. — Anniek Bao Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, says China needs more targeted and substantial fiscal stimulus measures, accompanied by confidence-building measures from the government. Speaking to CNBC's "Street Signs Asia," the economist said China's weak consumer inflation data released on Monday was "not surprising, but certainly disappointing." "This certainly gives the government a very important indication that the stimulus measures that have been put in place so far are not delivering the goods in terms of bolstering growth and bolstering private sector confidence," he said. He added that to get the economy back on track, the government will need to propose additional stimulus and confidence-building measures at its annual central economic work conference this week. — Dylan Butts Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders are gearing up for the annual central economic work conference, reportedly set to take place this week, as Beijing strives to boost growth. While an official date for the two-day conclave has yet to be announced, Bloomberg has reported that the closed-door meeting will be held from Dec. 11 to 12. Usually, the annual conference is preceded by the high-profile gathering of the Politburo, the top decision making body led by president Xi. During both meetings, top policymakers will review economic performance and policy implementation in the current year, while setting priorities for the following year, economists at Goldman Sachs said. Read the full story here. — Anniek Bao South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok urged the National Assembly to speed up the finalization of the country's 2025 budget on Monday, according to a report from local media agency Yonhap. The country's government has been at a legislative standstill in the aftermath of President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief martial law declaration and subsequent events, with discussions on the 2025 budget proposal mostly stalled. Last month, the main opposition Democratic Party had tried to push through a smaller budget bill than that proposed by the ruling party. However, the National Assembly Speaker put the plan on hold, calling on rival parties to compromise. The Democratic Party is now reportedly pushing to pass its version of the budget in a plenary session set for Tuesday. — Dylan Butts China's consumer prices rose less-than-expected in November, climbing 0.2% from a year ago, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a slight pickup in consumer prices to 0.5% in November from a year ago, versus 0.3% in October. China's producer price index declined for the 26th month. Producer inflation fell by 2.5% year on year in November, less than the estimated 2.8% decline as per the Reuters poll. The persistent near-zero inflation shows that China is still grappling with sluggish domestic demand and deflation at the wholesale level. This is in spite of Beijing's slate of stimulus efforts since September which has included interest rate cuts, support for the stock and property markets as well as efforts to boost bank lending. Read the full story here. — Lee Ying Shan 2024 has seen some massive stock rallies, as investor interest in themes such as AI has shown little sign of waning. As the year-end nears, CNBC Pro asked three fund managers what global stocks they are buying in the lead-up to 2025, as they attempt to get ahead of the curve. CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here. — Amala Balakrishner The S&P 500 is set for more gains in 2025, according to HSBC. The firm said it expects the broad market index to hit 6,700 by the end of next year, which implies more than 10% upside from Thursday's close. The index has already risen more than 27% this year. "While this year's equity rally was a mix of both earnings growth and a valuation re-rating (c50/50), we expect next year's equity returns to be focused on earnings growth as valuations are more stretched," analyst Nicole Inui told clients in a Friday note. "Overall, we expect earnings to grow by 9% incorporating a slower but still resilient US economy and some margin expansion." Inui also said she expects the U.S. economy to slow over the course of the next year but remain resilient as inflation eases. That would enable the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by another 125 basis points, she forecast. — Sean Conlon Despite the threat of tariffs next year, investors should stay bullish on stocks in 2025, according to UBS. "Heading into 2025, we think a constructive stance is warranted on global equities, and on U.S. stocks in particular," the bank wrote in a Friday report. "We note that historically U.S. equities tend to rally into presidential elections and after, with the average gain in the 150 trading days following an election averaging near 5% in data going back to 1928 for the S&P 500." UBS added that the U.S. sectors it views as most attractive are the technology, utilities and financial sectors. — Lisa Kailai Han The U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in November, marking a sharp rebound from the previous month. Economist polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 214,000 jobs for the month. Jobs growth for October was revised to 36,000 from 12,000. The unemployment rate came in at 4.2% for November, as was expected. — Fred Imbert Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: What We Got Right And Wrong In Our 2024 AI Predictions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2024/12/08/what-we-got-right-and-wrong-in-our-2024-ai-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-12-08T23:00:14Z
Full Content:
We predicted that Stability AI would shut down this year. The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down. At this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024. To keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today. Interestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions. And keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month! Nvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow. For now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course. Nvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia. It will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April. It seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true. But the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors. The Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern. At least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here. In a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote: “It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.” We agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models. But the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology. The release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing. Then OpenAI dropped o1. o1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research. In his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.” Before o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference. Because it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead. It is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance. This is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year: “As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.” In 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts. Considering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025. The transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.” That alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM). Mamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture. Cartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs. (Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.) Hyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year. The FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic. Regulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared. These regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.” A steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”) OpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer. Other sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief. We wrote in last December’s predictions article: “Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.” This has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started. So why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening. Nearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation. But a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases. In other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move. But substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other top AI news stories for the weekend. Last week, Sam Altman, CEO of AI company OpenAI, expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will support the artificial intelligence sector, ensuring the United States and its allies continue their lead. Altman told US broadcaster Fox News that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines “We need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that”. Trump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has “clarity” to empower the crypto industry to “thrive”. Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship”. Meanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy. Musk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren’t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk’s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk “deeply” knows artificial intelligence. The growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company. Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world’s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed “Project Rainer,” will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic’s current most advanced model. As reported by WIRED, the announcement was made at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas by Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. Once it is completed, the supercomputer will be the world’s largest AI machine featuring hundreds of thousands of its latest Trainium 2 AI training chips. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in AI-driven endpoint and cloud workload protection. On December 6th, the company announced that it has been named a Leader in the 2024 Frost Radar™: Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) for the third consecutive year. The leader in cloud security offers a single, unified platform, known as CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security which empowers customers to stop cloud breaches across every area of enterprise cloud risk and secure workloads. Recognizing this approach, Frost & Sullivan highlighted that “CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security delivers excellent capabilities to address modern cloud security challenges,” with broad coverage across cloud-native and Windows-based environments. It also said that the Falcon platform “offers advanced runtime protection, CDR, extensive platform support, and seamless integration with its XDR and MDR services, making it a leading choice for organizations seeking real-time cloud threat management.” “Adversaries are evolving faster than ever, exploiting the gaps created by tools marketed as CNAPPs that only scratch the surface with basic CSPM or vulnerability management. CrowdStrike’s recognition as a Leader in the Frost CNAPP Radar for the third consecutive year validates our ability to deliver a comprehensive solution that doesn’t just identify risks—it actually stops breaches. Falcon Cloud Security empowers organizations to close critical gaps, outpace threats, and scale their security for the future on a single, unified platform”. Overall, CRWD ranks 2nd on our list of top AI news stories for the weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By week’s end, many will shift their focus to holiday celebrations, but for now, investors are keeping a watchful eye on developments in the stock market, eager to gauge how these signals might influence the trajectory of the markets heading into the new year. This week brings a few important earnings. On Monday, Oracle (ORCL+0.48%) Corporation will release its earnings after the closing bell, offering insights into the demand for corporate tech services. On Tuesday, GameStop (GME+7.59%) will take the spotlight with its earnings report, which is also scheduled for after the market close. Wednesday shifts focus to Adobe (ADBE+0.47%), which will reveal its financials at the end of the trading day. Thursday rounds out the week with a series of significant earnings announcements. AI giant Broadcom (AVGO+6.57%) will report its performance, offering clues about the health of the semiconductor and AI-driven technology markets. Retail powerhouse Costco (COST+0.11%) will also release its results, shedding light on consumer spending habits amid shifting economic conditions. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors, as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the market will receive initial jobless claims data, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Finally, on Friday, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will be released. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth. Microsoft (MSFT+1.26%) will determine on Tuesday whether to invest in Bitcoin, although the board has recommended voting against the proposal, citing that the company already considers a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. The AI Summit kicks off in New York on Wednesday, bringing together industry leaders and innovators for two days of exploration into how artificial intelligence is transforming lives and reshaping various sectors. The event will feature keynote speakers from major tech giants such as Google (GOOGL+5.55%) and Meta (META+2.12%).

Title: What is high bandwidth memory and why is the US trying to block China’s access to it? | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. The US government has imposed fresh export controls on the sale of high tech memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications to China. The rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones. Here’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI. High bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory). HBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Most importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN. The latest set of export restrictions, announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge. As retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment. Experts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron (MU), it is developing its own capabilities in the area. “What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.” In China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency. What makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips. Because AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches. Larger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on. Think of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate. “It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway. You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson. Currently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM. As of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a research note published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%. As for Micron, the company aims to grow its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron. The high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is expected to account for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year. Imagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM. On the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip. That is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging. “Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu. In addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise. “You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

This was in sharp contrast to their net outflows of ₹21,612 crore in November 2024 and massive net withdrawal of ₹94,017 crore recorded in October 2024. Prior to the latest turnaround, FPIs had remained net sellers for eight consecutive weeks. In September, FPIs had bought Indian equities worth ₹57,724 crore. The robust buying was prompted by BJP-led combine making a strong comeback in Maharashtra and US equity benchmarks clocking new all time highs. Taking the latest robust December inflows into account, FPIs have so far this calendar year pumped in ₹9,435 crore in India as compared to net outflows of ₹15,019 crore at the end of November, depositories data showed. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said that FPIs turning buyers in early December, in total reversal of their sustained selling strategy during the last two months, has altered the market sentiments. “In December, through 6th, FPIs have turned buyers having bought equity for ₹17,921 crores through exchanges. Including the purchases through the primary market, the total FPIs buying through December 6th stood at ₹24,453 crores”, he said. This is a clear change in FPI strategy in India. “It can be argued that the stage of relentless FPI selling is over”, Vijayakumar added. Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said “Looking ahead, the flow of foreign investments into Indian equity markets will hinge on several key factors. These include the policies implemented under Donald Trump’s presidency, the prevailing inflation and interest rate environment, and the evolving geopolitical landscape”. Additionally, the third-quarter earnings performance of Indian companies and the country’s progress on the economic growth front will play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment and influencing foreign inflows, he said. Srivastava said there could be few probable reasons for this sharp u-turn by FPIs towards Indian equities in December after selling around $14 billion between October and November. The recent correction in the market could have prompted them to build some exposure. Uncertainty over Chinese equities on the back of proposed tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump on China and other several nations could have prompted FPIs to look back at Indian equities which offers a much clearer long term growth prospects, despite relatively high valuations, he said. Additionally, FPIs might have decided to rejig their portfolios a bit towards India given suboptimal GDP number would have fanned hopes that RBI might soon have to start cutting rates to boost the economy, which in turn might boost the equity markets. For the uninitiated, in its recent monetary policy review on December 6, 2024, RBI had cut CRR by 50 bps to 4 per cent, while keeping repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, he noted.

Title: » A Conversation with Andrew Plotkin The Digital Antiquarian

Time Published: 2024-12-08T05:47:01Z

For some of you, Andrew Plotkin will need no introduction. The rest of you ought to know that he’s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he’s written an even dozen fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from 1995’s A Change in the Weather, the co-winner of the very first IF Competition, to his 2014 Kickstarter-funded epic Hadean Lands. While he was about it, he made vital technical contributions to interactive fiction as well; perhaps most notably, he invented a new virtual machine called Glulx, which finally allowed games written with the Inform programming language to burst beyond the boundaries of Infocom’s old Z-Machine, while the accompanying Glk input-output library allowed then to make use of graphics, sound, and modern typography. Over the last ten years or so, Andrew — or “Zarf,” as his friends who know him just a little bit better than I do generally call him — has moved into more of an organizing role in the interactive-fiction community, taking steps to place it on a firm footing so that its most important institutions can outlive old-timers like him and me. Andrew was kind enough to sit down with me recently for a wide-ranging conversation that started with his formative years as an Infocom superfan in the 1980s, went on to encompass some of his seminal games and other contributions of the 1990s and beyond, and wound up in the here and now. I hope you’ll enjoy reading this transcript of our discussion as much as I enjoyed chatting with Andrew screen to screen. He’s refreshingly honest about the sweet and the bitter of being a digital creator working mostly in niche forms. One final note before we get started: Andrew is currently available for contract or full-time employment. If you have need of an experienced programmer, systems architect, writer, and/or game designer whose body of work speaks for itself, you can contact him through his website. The munchkin Zarf, 1971. Perhaps we should start with some very general background. Have you lived in the Boston area your whole life? No, not at all! I only moved to Boston in 2005. I was born in 1970 in Syracuse, New York, a place that I don’t remember at all because my family moved to New Jersey when I was about three. We lived there for a couple of years, then my father got a job in the Washington, D.C., area. I went to primary school through high school there. And when and where did you first encounter interactive fiction? It must have been around 1979. My father’s company had a “bring your family to work” day. A teletype there was running Adventure. My father plunked me down in front of it and explained what was going on. I thought it was the best thing in the universe. I banged on it for a couple of hours while everybody else was running around the office, although I didn’t get very far. For the next few months, Dad was playing it at work, illicitly — that was how everybody played it. He would bring home these giant sheets of fan-fold printer paper showing his latest progress. As I recall, I suggested the solution to the troll-bridge puzzle: giving the golden eggs to the troll. That was great, the first adventure-game puzzle I solved. When did you first get a computer at home? Around 1980, we got an Apple II Plus. We acquired the first three Scott Adams games and Zork, which was newly available, plus Microsoft’s port of Adventure to the Apple II. Andrew’s bar mitzvah cake took the form of an Apple II. That started my lifelong attachment to Infocom. I played all the games as they came out. I begged my folks to buy them for me. Later, I spent my own money on them. You played all of the Infocom games upon their first release? Pretty much, up until I went off to college. I remember that I did not play Plundered Hearts when it came out. That one was a hard sell for a lot of young men — although it’s a brilliant game. Yeah. I didn’t play it because I was a seventeen-year-old boy. I also didn’t play Zork Zero or the [illustrated] games that came after it because I had gone off to college and didn’t have the Apple II anymore. But I did catch up with all of them a few years later. You mention that you did get some adventure games from other companies when you first got the Apple II. Did that continue, or were you exclusively loyal to Infocom? Well, I was haunting the download BBSes and snarfing any pirated game I could. I played Wizardry and Ultima. I didn’t play too many other text adventures. I knew they existed — I had seen ads for Mike Berlyn’s pre-Infocom stuff — but I didn’t really hunt them down because I knew that Infocom was actually better at it. I remember that we had The Wizard and the Princess, which was just clunky and weird and not actually solvable. I know that you also wrote some of your own text adventures on the Apple II in BASIC, as a lot of people were doing at this time. Yes. The first one I did was a parody of Enchanter. I called it Enchanter II. It was a joke game that I could upload to the BBSes: “Look, it’s the sequel!” It was very silly. It started out pretending to be an Infocom game, then started throwing in Doctor Who jokes. The closing line was, “You may have lost, but we have gained,” the ending from the Apple II Prisoner game. It was terrible. But I did write it and release it. Unfortunately, as far as I know it’s lost. I’ve never seen it archived anywhere. I did Inhumane after that. That was another parody game, but it was meant to have actual puzzles. It was inspired by the Grimtooth’s Traps role-playing books. I liked the idea of people dying in funny ways. Inhumane is obviously juvenilia, but at the same time it shows some of what was to come in your games. There’s a subversive angle to it: here’s a game full of traps where the objective is to hit all the traps. That’s the way I play a lot of games, but inadvertently. Here that’s the point. Were you heavily into tabletop RPGs? No. Tabletop role-playing I was never into. I get performance anxiety when I’m asked to come up with stories on the fly. I just don’t enjoy sitting at a table and being in that position. It’s not my thing. But I was interested in role-playing scenarios and source books. First, because of the long-term connection to [computer] adventure games, second because they had so much creative world-building and storytelling, just to read. So, yeah. I was interested in tabletop role-playing games but not in actually playing them. A surprising number of people have told me the same: they never played tabletop RPGs much but they liked the source books. For some people, the imagination that goes into those is enough, it seems. So, you go off to university. Why did you choose Carnegie Mellon University? I got rejected by MIT! It was second on the list. Were you aware that Infocom was connected so closely to MIT? No. I knew that they were in Cambridge because I subscribed to the Status Line newsletter. There was a running theme of them mentioning stuff around Cambridge. And I’d played The Lurking Horror. But I didn’t have the full context of “these were MIT students who made Zork at MIT.” I guess it would have made the rejection even more painful if you’d known. At university, you’re exposed to Unix and the Mac for the first time. Yes. And to the Internet. And I started learning “real” programming languages like C. Did you also play games at university? Yes. I ran into roguelikes for the first time. Which ones did you play? I played a fair bit of Advanced Rogue, but I never got good at it. There were people playing NetHack, but it was clear that that was a game where you had to put in a lot of time to make any serious progress. Rogue was a little bit lighter. Yeah. I never was willing to put in the hours and hours that it takes to get good at those games. Now especially, when I write about so many games, I just don’t have the time to devote 200 hours to NetHack. You’ve since re-implemented one of your own programming experiments from university, Praser 5. That was not originally a parser-based text adventure. It was a puzzle stuck inside the CMU filesystem. Every “room” was a directory, connected by symlinks. You literally CDed into the directory and typed “ls,” and the description would pop up in the file listing. Then you would type, “cd up,” “cd left,” whatever, to follow symlinks to other directories. It was an experiment in using the tools of a shared computer system to make an embedded game. The riddles were a matter of running a small executable which was linked in each directory. I used file permissions to give people access to more things as they solved more puzzles. Much later, after I had learned Inform 6, I did the parser version. What did you do right after university? I graduated in 1992, but I wanted to stick around the Pittsburgh area because a lot of my friends hadn’t graduated yet. I got a job in the CMU computer-science department and shacked up with a couple of classmates in a rundown apartment. That was great. I bought my first Macintosh and started writing stuff on it. That’s when I started working on System’s Twilight. I figured it was time for me to get into my games career. I decided to write a game and release it as shareware to make actual money. So, I bought a tremendous number of Macintosh programming manuals, which I still have. System’s Twilight has the fingerprints of Cliff Johnson of Fool’s Errand fame all over it. Yes. It was an homage. When did you first play his games? Was that at university? Yeah. Those came out between 1988 and 1992, when I was there. I had a campus job, so I could afford a couple of games. I played them on the campus Macintoshes. I remember very well being in one of the computer clusters at two in the morning, solving the final meta-puzzle of The Fool’s Errand. I had written down all of the clues the game had fed me on papers that were spread out all over the desk. Every time I used one of the clues, I’d grab the piece of paper, crumple it up, and throw it over my shoulder. When I finished, the desk was empty and I was surrounded by paper. We had an amazing experience with The Fool’s Errand as well. My wife fell in love with it. It was our obsession for two weeks. When I talked to Cliff Johnson years ago, my wife told me to tell him that he was the only man other than me that she could see herself marrying. I wasn’t sure how to take that. What were your expectations for System’s Twilight? I intended to make some money. I didn’t know how much would show up or whether it would lead to more things. It was just something I could do that would be a lot more fun than the programming I was doing in my day job. Now that you had your own Macintosh and a steady income, I guess you started buying more commercial games again? I know you have a huge love for Myst, which came out around this time. I was actually a little bit late to Myst. I didn’t play it until 1994, when everybody was already talking about it. But when you did, it was love at first sight? Yeah. The combination of the environment and the soundscape was great and the puzzles were fun. It felt like someone was finally doing the graphical adventure right. I’d never gotten into the LucasArts and Sierra versions of graphical adventures because they were sort of parodic, and the environments weren’t actually attractive. They were very pixelated. They just weren’t trying to be immersive. But Myst was doing it right. As long as we’re on the subject: I guess Riven absolutely blew your mind? Yes, it did. It was vastly larger and more interesting and more cohesively thought-through than Myst had been. I played it obsessively and solved it and was very happy. At what point did you get involved with the people who would wind up being the founders of a post-Infocom interactive-fiction community? In 1993 or 1994, someone pointed me to an open-source Infocom interpreter. I hadn’t really been aware of the technology stack behind Infocom’s games. But now you could pull all of the games off of the Lost Treasures disks and run them on Unix machines. That was kind of interesting. I don’t remember how I encountered the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup. But when I did, people were talking about reverse-engineering the Infocom technology. I wrote an interpreter of my own for [Unix] X Windows that had proportional fonts, command-line editing, command history, scroll bars — all the stuff we take for granted nowadays. I released that, then ported it to the Macintosh. That was my first major interaction with rec.arts.int-fiction. It must have been around this time that Kevin Wilson made a very historically significant post on Usenet, announcing the very first IF Competition. You submitted A Change in the Weather and won the Inform category. Did you write that game specifically for the Comp? Let me back up a little bit. In early 1995, I got an offer from a game company in Washington, D.C, called Magnet Interactive, to port games from 3DO to Macintosh. So, I moved to Washington — I was very sad to leave Pittsburgh behind — and rented a terrible little rundown apartment there. I was also making some money from System’s Twilight, and had started working on a sequel, which was to be called Moondials. It was a slog. I had some ideas for puzzles, but the story was just not coming together. So, when Kevin Wilson said, “Hey, let’s do this thing,” I said, “I’m going to take a break from Moondials and write a text adventure very fast.” The process started with downloading Inform 5 and the manual and reading it. I think I blasted through the manual five times in a week. The start of the Competition was a little weird because we didn’t yet have the idea of all of the games being made available at the same time. Kevin just said, “Upload your games to the IF Archive.” So, all of the games trickled in at different times. For the second Comp, we settled very firmly on the idea of all games being released at the same time because the 1995 experience was not very satisfactory. I know that it’s always frustrating to be asked where ideas come from. But sometimes it’s unavoidable, so I’m going to ask it about A Change in the Weather. I think I was drawing on the general sense of being an introvert and not making friends easily — being separated from people and feeling alienated from my social group. My college experience wasn’t solidly that. I was an introvert, but I was at a computer college, and there were a lot of introverts and introvert-centered social groups. I had friends, had housemates after college, as I said. But I still struggled somewhat with social activities. It was a failure mode I was always aware of, that I might end up on the edge not really talking to people. I drew on that experience in general in creating the scenario of A Change in the Weather. That’s interesting. From my outsider perspective, I can see that much more in So Far, your next game. It really dwells on this theme of alienation and connection, or the lack thereof. That also strikes me as the game of yours that’s most overtly influenced by Myst. Just from the nature of the environment and the magical-mechanical puzzles. It’s not deserted like Myst, but you can’t interact in any meaningful way with the people who are there — which goes back to this theme of alienation. I wasn’t thinking of Myst specifically there, but it was part of my background by that point. The direct emotional line in So Far was breaking up with my college girlfriend. That was a couple of years in the past by this point. That had been in Pittsburgh. A lot of the energy for working on System’s Twilight came from suddenly being stuck at home after that relationship ended. I channeled my frustrations into programming. But then I tried to drop it into So Far as a theme of people being separated. None of the specifics of what had happened were relevant to the game — just the feeling. By the time of So Far, you were as big as names get in modern interactive fiction. Your next game Lists and Lists was arguably not a game at all. What made you decide to write a LISP tutorial as interactive fiction? Do you have a special relationship with LISP? Yes! I hate it! I had taken functional-programming courses in college and learned LISP. But I just did not jibe with it at all. That’s ironic because Infocom’s programming language ZIL was heavily based on LISP. Right. It was an MIT thing, but it was not my thing. Nevertheless, the concept of building it into the Z-Machine with a practical limit of 64 K of RAM — or really less than that — seemed doable. And I had written a LISP interpreter as a programming exercise during my first or second year in college. So, I was aware of the basics. Doing it in Inform wasn’t a gigantic challenge, just a certain amount of work. Were you already starting to feel restless with the traditional paradigm of interactive fiction? Right after Lists and Lists, you released The Space Under the Window, which might almost work better if it was implemented in hypertext. It’s almost interactive poetry. I wasn’t bored with traditional games, but I did want to try different things and see what could be done. And writing in Inform was simple enough that I could just whip out an idea and see whether it worked. That was inspiring the whole community at this point. That was the lesson of the first IF Comp: you can just sit down and try an idea, and a month later people will be talking about it. There was a very rapid fermentation cycle. Yes. It led to much more formal experimentation. Before the Comp came along, everybody was trying to follow the Infocom model and make big games. But if you have an idea that’s more conceptual or avant garde, it’s often better suited to a smaller game. The Comp created a space for that. If you do something and submit it to the Comp, even if it’s highly experimental, it will get played and noticed and discussed. Now we come to The Big One of your games in many people’s eyes. And I must admit that this applies to me as well. Spider and Web is such a brilliantly conceived game. I’m in awe of this game. So, thank you for that. You’re welcome. It’s always tricky to have a game which is so purely built out of a single idea because then, when you try to write another game, you think you have to come up with another idea that’s as good, and it’s never possible. Was this idea born out of any particular experience, perhaps with other media? I don’t think it was. I was prying into what we would now call the triangle of identities — prying into the idea that what the game’s text is telling you is a point of view that might have biases behind it. There is a dialog between what the player thinks about the world and what the game thinks about the world, and there can be cracks in between. That led to the idea of using the storytelling of the game to tell a lie, and that there is a truth behind it which can be discerned. I started with that kernel and started coming up with puzzle scenarios. Here is an outcome that is verifiable. But there’s two different versions of what happened that could have led to that outcome. I’m going to tell one, but the other is going to be the truth. I strung together a few different versions of that. Then I said, okay, if we’re lying, then the introduction of the game has to introduce the lie. So I folded that in from the start. I knew that I wanted a two-part structure: you learn what’s going on, then you make use of all of the information. The moment of transition between the two is often referred to as simply The Puzzle. It’s been called the best single text-adventure puzzle ever created. Did you realize how special it was at the time? No. I figured it would be a puzzle. I didn’t understand how much of an impact it would have. I knew that I wanted to surprise players by having a possibility suddenly become available. Here’s a thing that I can do, and I will do it. Any kind of good puzzle solution is a surprise when you think of it. Afterward it seems obvious. I knew I had a good combination of elements to make it work, but I wasn’t thinking about the way that it would reorient the entire history of the game in the player’s head in one fell swoop. I don’t know. Maybe I had an inkling. What I love is that the game is called Spider and Web. Suddenly when you solve that puzzle, those two categories get reversed. Who is really the spider and who is caught in the web? The reason I called it Spider and Web was actually the old idiom “What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.” The notion of deception was meant to be part of the title, and the spider was there just to go with the web. But yes, it’s multi-valent. I know you’re a big reader of science fiction and fantasy. I wouldn’t picture you reading a James Bond novel. What made you decide to go in the direction of spy fiction here? Honestly, I thought of it as science fiction. The spy fiction was merely because the story was about deception, and somebody had to be fooling somebody. But conceptually, I had it pinned as a science-fiction scenario from some kind of dystopian cold war, but with magically advanced technology. You entered Hunter, in Darkness into the 1999 IF Comp. It’s a riff on Hunt the Wumpus, which is about the most minimalist imaginable text adventure, if you can even call it that. Your game, by contrast, is a lushly atmospheric, viscerally horrifying fiction. Were you just being cheeky? Yeah, I was. I just wanted to put in all the stuff that Wumpus didn’t have, without getting away from the core concept. I thought it would be a funny thing to do. I worked really hard on the claustrophobia and the creepy bats. I remember crawling under a chair to try to get the feel of being in a narrow passage and not being able to move around — just to get the bodily sense of that. Then we have Shade from 2000, which is another of my favorites of your games. Even more than Hunter, in Darkness, it has a horror vibe. Yes. I leaned into it harder in Shade. There are all kinds of opinions about what is really going on in Shade. I know you like to let people draw their own conclusions about your games, so I won’t press you on that… I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on the main point, that you’re dying and this is all a hallucination. Yeah, that was absolutely my take on it, that you’re dying of thirst in the desert. I saw it pointed out in a review that everything you’re trying to do is the opposite of the real problem you have. You’re trying to get out of your apartment in the hallucination, but your real problem is that you are out, lost in the desert. Was that something you were consciously doing, or are we all reading too much into it? Well, neither. I don’t think I was consciously thinking that way, but that doesn’t mean that you’re reading stuff into it. It’s deliberately ambiguous. I had a lot of images in my head that I threw out at random. I did have the notion that this environment in your apartment was from your past. You really had packed up your apartment and called a taxi and gotten out, and reiterating it was… inappropriate but real. It was in your head while you were having this terrible experience, and it was being replayed by your brain in a broken way. You’re in a place of blinding light — it’s very hot — and the experience you’re replaying is very dim and dark, except that when light occurs it’s painful. A rare 1999 meeting in the flesh of interactive-fiction luminaries. From left: Andrew Plotkin, Chris Klimas, David Dyte, and Adam Cadre. Although your games of the 1990s are fondly remembered and still played, you were also making major technical contributions. Probably most important was the Glulx — sorry, I can’t say that word! — virtual machine to let Inform games expand beyond the strictures of Infocom’s old Z-Machine. How did that come about? No one knows how to pronounce it! I started to think about it in probably 1996, when Graham [Nelson] came out with version 7 and 8 of the Z-Machine. Version 8 was big — big enough for Graham’s Jigsaw — but it was still just a stopgap. It was only twice as big as Infocom’s version 5. There were all kinds of things that didn’t scale. It seemed worthwhile to make a fresh design that would be 32-bit from the start. I just didn’t want to deal with more incremental changes. And being able to jettison all of the weird legacy stuff about the Z-Machine seemed like a win too — being able to rethink all of these decisions in a technological context that is not 1979. One of the things I wanted to do was to separate out the input-output layer. I had already written Z-Machine interpreters for X Windows and Mac that used Mark Howell’s ZIP engine with different interface front-ends. When TADS went open-source around 1997, I made an interpreter for that. So, now I had this matrix, right? I’ve got an X Windows front-end and a Mac front-end, and they both slap onto the Z-Machine and the TADS virtual machine. In a pretty clear way, these things are just plug and play. All the virtual machine does is accept text input and generate text output. I mean, yes, there’s the status line, maybe sound and graphics, but fundamentally that’s what it’s doing. And the front-end presents that text in a way that suits the platform on which it’s running. I was doing the same thing that Infocom did, just slicing it into more layers. Infocom had an interpreter and a game file. I said, we’re going to have an interpreter engine and an interpreter front-end. Thus there will be more flexibility. I designed the front-end first, the Glk library. I made an implementation for Mac and for X Windows and for the Unix command line. Then I started thinking about the virtual machine. I ripped apart the Inform 6 compiler so it could compile to Glulx from the same game source code. As I recall, the Glulx virtual machine is bigger than the Z-Machine — for all practical purposes, its capacity is infinite — but also simpler. There’s less of the hard-coded stuff that Infocom included, like the object tables. Yes, exactly. I figured the more generic and simple I could make it, the better. It would be simpler to design and simpler to implement. It adds complexity to the compiler, but the compiler already needs code to generate object tables in a specific format. It would still be doing that, but there wouldn’t be any hardware support for them. I’d just have to include veneer routines to handle object tables in this format. Then, if we ever need to change the format, no problem. We just change the compiler. We don’t need to change the virtual machine. When did you publish the Glulx specification? April 1, 1999. Were you still living in Washington, D.C., at this time? I had moved around a lot, actually. The job in D.C. only lasted about a year and a half. After the porting project I had been doing finished up, the company dropped me onto a project to do a Highlander licensed game, which we had absolutely no concept of how to do. This would have been like a 3D action game. That project got canned. Then I worked for a document company in Maryland for a while. Then I moved back to Pittsburgh and worked for a startup. The startup got acquired by Red Hat, and they moved us down to North Carolina. That was from like 1999 to 2000. Then Red Hat fired us and I moved back to Pittsburgh. From 2000 to 2005 I worked for a filesystem company in Pittsburgh. You took a break from writing interactive fiction for a few years after Shade. Then there was a little bit of a shift in focus when you did come back in 2004 with The Dreamhold. Your earlier games don’t try too hard to be accessible. When you returned, you seemed more interested in outreach and accessibility. What was the thought process there? Only the obvious one. It’s true that all of my previous games were written very much for the community. They were written for people who knew how IF worked. But The Dreamhold was specifically an outreach game. I wanted to try to expand the community. We’d been doing this for about ten years at that point, and it was kind of the same crowd of people. I thought to create an outreach game as a total wild-ass experiment to try to bring in people from other parts of the gaming world. I didn’t know whether it would work, but I figured it was worth a try. So I designed a game specifically for that purpose, built around explaining how traditional interactive fiction worked to people who didn’t know how to play it. That meant doing some wacky stuff. There are some rooms in The Dreamhold that you enter by going north, but to go back you have to go east, because I figured, this is really uncomfortable, but people are going to run into this if they get into IF, so they should be familiar with the concept. I’ll try to introduce it as smoothly as possible by putting messages like, “The corridor turns as you head to the north.” Then put in the [room] description, “You can go back the way you came, toward the east,” to try to make it more tangible. But I wanted to introduce complicated maps and darkness and all of the hardcore stuff that the community was used to. And also make it fun. There were a number of these outreach efforts at the time. Some people were taking IF games to more conventional game jams. There were cheat sheets of “how to play IF” going around. My impression is that these efforts weren’t super successful. Is that your impression as well? Yes, it is. None of it actually worked. It’s great that we made the on-ramps and it’s good that we still maintain them, but there was not a huge influx of new people coming onto the scene at that point. My impression is that the community didn’t really start to grow until it opened itself up to non-parser-driven games: the Twine games and ChoiceScript games and so on. Presumably some percentage of those players became willing to try the parser games as well. Yeah, but that was a little bit later, after 2010 or so. There was still a gap. I decided, well, The Dreamhold didn’t make an impact, so I’m just going to go back to writing wacky puzzle games. Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. I would say that drew people into creating games, because it was much more approachable for people who were not C programmers. There was a bit of a revolution there. It was just harder to see because it was new authors rather than new players. The time around 2010 was an exciting one for you personally as well as the community. In addition to the ongoing buzz about Inform 7, Jason Scott released his Get Lamp documentary, and you launched a Kickstarter to make a game called Hadean Lands soon after. Yes. In 2010, Jason Scott premiered Get Lamp at PAX East. He had interviewed me two or three years earlier — probably in 2007. Yeah, he worked on that movie for almost ten years. Exactly. It’s kind of funny to look back at 2007 and see me talking about releasing commercial interactive fiction. But in 2010, all of the old Infocom guys showed up at PAX East. I was on that panel, sitting with Dave Lebling, Brian Moriarty, and Steve Meretzky. I was going… [genuflecting] PAX East, 2010. From left: Dave Lebling, Don Woods, Brian Moriarty, Andrew Plotkin, Nick Montfort, Steve Meretzky, and Jason Scott. (Photo by Eric Havir.) I’m not worthy! Exactly. Jason Scott brought Get Lamp to a game class at Tufts University a few weeks later. Since I was living about half a mile away, I came in and said, “Hi, I’m in this movie.” Afterward, I went up to Jason and said, “You know, people are talking about interactive fiction for the first time in fifteen years outside of our little community. Do you think I should do a Kickstarter for a giant IF game?” And Jason looks at me like I’ve got bananas growing out of my ears and says, “Yes, you should!” He’s the most enthusiastic person in the world. Yes. And of course, he’d just done a Kickstarter for the Get Lamp release. This was early for Kickstarter. There had been gaming Kickstarter projects before, but no really gigantic ones. So, getting $30,000 for an IF Kickstarter was kind of a big deal in 2010. So I went to the boss at my day job and said, “Well, I guess this is it for us. I’m quitting.” I knew that $30,000 wasn’t actually going to last me very long, living in Boston. But of course, I’d been in the software industry for decades by this point, so I had a fair amount of savings cushion built up. And I had a pile of Red Hat stock which was worth some money. I could live on it while I found my footing as an indie developer. The Dreamhold had taken me nine months. I thought Hadean Lands would take me a year. Ha! It turned out that writer’s block is a hell of a thing. Hadean Lands kept getting sidelined. I got totally knocked over by the idea of doing a hypertext MUD. I spent a year writing that. That was Seltani, which was hugely popular for about two months in the Myst fan community; I did it as a Myst fan game and presented it at a Myst convention. Everybody loved it. But I wasn’t writing Hadean Lands, and eventually my KickStarter backers started to get upset about that. I did slog through it. I got Hadean Lands done [in 2014]. I don’t feel like the story is hugely successful, but I’m very happy with the puzzle structure and the game layout. As you know as well as I do, there’s a whole checkered history of people trying to monetize IF. A few years ago, Bob Bates of Infocom and Legend fame released Thaumistry. I was a beta-tester on that game. The game was very good, but these things just never work. It’s always a disappointment in the end. Nobody has ever cracked that code. If you look at the Thaumistry Kickstarter and the Hadean Lands Kickstarter, you see that they made almost the same amount of money from almost the same number of backers. It’s the same crowd showing up: “Yeah, we still love ya!” But they’re not enough to make a living from… The problem is getting outside of that crowd. It’s no wonder that people like Emily Short have long since decamped, saying, “I have to work on different kinds of games with a larger reach.” What about you? Do you think you will ever return to parser-based interactive fiction? That’s a fair question. I’ve had a lot of starts toward things that I thought might be interesting. I started working on a framework for a kind of text game that’s not parser-based but also not hypertext in the sense that Twine is. It’s more combinatoric. I got two-thirds of the way done with building the engine and one-third of the way done with writing a game, then I kind of lost it. But I still think it’s interesting and I might go back to it. I don’t think it would go big the way Twine did, but it might reach a different audience. It’s a different way of thinking about the game structure. Would you care to talk about your partnership with Jason Shiga to turn his interactive comic books into digital apps? I have played Meanwhile, the first of those. Sure. I’d been aware of Jason Shiga ever since I started hanging out with Nick Montfort at MIT after I moved to Boston. Nick had a bunch of his early self-published stuff. He had the original printing of Meanwhile, as a black-and-white hand-cut book. I thought it was really neat. Totally by coincidence, Meanwhile got picked up by a publisher just before that 2010 PAX East we talked about. A nice big hardback version of it was published. It was being sold at PAX East. I thought, man, this is great, I’d really love to do an iPhone version. This was 2010; iPhone games were big. A little later, I did the Hadean Lands Kickstarter and quit my job. I needed to have more projects than just one text adventure, so I wrote to Jason Shiga and said, “Hey, I’m a big fan. I’d love to do an app version of your book.” Jason was amenable, so we had the usual conversations with lawyers and agents and signed a contract. I worked on that at the same time that I was planning out Hadean Lands. The iPhone app came out in 2011. So, the finances of making a go of it as an independent creator of digital content without a day job didn’t quite pan out for you in the end. I feel your pain, believe me. It’s a hard row to hoe. What came next? After Meanwhile and Hadean Lands, I felt very stuck. Jason [Shiga] was off working on non-interactive comics, so there wasn’t anything to do there. I bummed around for a while trying to find something that would make any kind of money at all, but I was not successful. I’m skipping over huge chunks of time here, but in 2017 Emily Short and Aaron Reed were working on a project to do NPC dialog as a commercial product. It was essentially taking Emily’s old ideas about threaded dialog in parser games and turning them into a plugin which game designers could use in any game to have interesting multi-threaded conversations. I spent a couple of years working on that project with them. But it turned out that management at that company sucked and everybody bailed. Since then until this year, I’ve been working for big and small games studios, working on the dialog parts of their games. Coding dialog engines or writing dialog? I’ve been a software engineer, working on the coding part, but working with the writers. Also during this period, Jason Shiga started writing what he calls “Adventuregame Comics,” which are shorter Meanwhile-style books. I’ve started porting those. The Steam port of The Beyond and the iOS and Steam port of Leviathan are available now. The iOS port of The Beyond will be coming later. Since Hadean Lands, you’ve stepped into more of an organizing role in the IF community. Yes. I’m very proud to have transitioned from being a hotshot game writer to someone who is doing community support, building structures and traditions and conferences. I never wanted to be a person who was only famous for writing games, especially after I started writing fewer games. I really didn’t want to be a person who was famous for having been a big game writer in the 1990s. That’s a sucky position to be stuck in. There needs to be a second act. It’s maybe a maturation process as well. When you get a little bit older, you realize that some things are important in a way you may not have when you were a young, hotshot game writer. Yeah. I slowed down writing games because I started to second-guess myself too much. When you’ve written a lot of games that people got really excited about… Then you’re competing with your own back catalog. It doesn’t feel good. I’ve had trouble getting away from that. You’ve done most of your organizational work in the context of the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, so maybe we should talk about that more specifically. I’ll give you my impression of the reasons for its founding, and you can tell me if I’m right. You and some other people decided it would be wise to institutionalize things a little bit more, so that the community is no longer so dependent on individuals who come and go. With a foundation and a funding model and all of these institutional aspects, hopefully you set up the community for the long haul, so that it can survive if a server goes down or someone goes away. Yeah, that’s exactly where it started. We’d been running for decades on people just setting up a server somewhere and saying, “Hey, I’ll run this thing!” That was the original IF Archive, the Usenet newsgroups, IF Comp, the Interactive Fiction Database, the IF Forum. It was workable, but everything was being paid out of somebody’s pocket. There wasn’t a lot of discussion about who was doing what or how much it cost. There was no fallback plan and no thinking about what would come next if somebody stopped doing something. Like, there was a long period when IFDB wasn’t getting any updates because Mike Roberts had a day job. Some things about it were clunky and hard to use, but you couldn’t fix them. So, in 2015 or early 2016, Jason McIntosh, who was running the IF Comp at that point, had a conversation with somebody who said, “Why don’t you have a non-profit organization to support the IF Comp? Then you could get donations from people.” And Jason started running around in circles with a gleam in his eye, saying, “Yes! We should do this! We should do this! Whom do I know who can help?” He started talking to other people who were longtime supporters of things in the community. That included Chris Klimas, who had been supporting Twine for three or four years, and me — I’d been supporting the IF Archive for a while. Then Carolyn VanEseltine and Flourish Klink joined. Flourish was the only one who knew how to set up a non-profit. They had run a Harry Potter fan conference as a teenager, and, being excited and not knowing things were hard, had just done it. We got into contact with the same lawyer Flourish had used. The lawyer told us what we needed: forms, bylaws, etc. Jason was the first president, I was the first treasurer. We went down to my bank and opened a business account for the organization. Then we wrote to the IRS to become a 501 C3 non-profit. We set up a website, found someone to give us a basic Web design and a logo. Then we announced it. At the start, we just did the IF Comp; we collected about $8000 that first year for a prize pool. But over the course of the first couple of years, we added Twine and the IF Archive. The IF Forum was the next big addition. Then the IF Wiki and IFDB. Today each has its own steering group. And we have a grants committee now. The NarraScope conference is another IFTF project. Would you like to tell a bit about that? That was my idea. I’d always been keen on the idea of having a narrative-game-oriented conference. I’d been going to GDC for many years. GDC has a sub-track, a narrative-game summit, which is where people like Emily Short and Jon Ingold hang out. But it’s a very tiny slice of what GDC is. And of course GDC is expensive, so it’s hard to bring in the hobbyists and the indie people and the people who write IF Comp games. They just can’t afford GDC. I wanted to provide an alternative that was more approachable and affordable and friendly. Once we as an organization had steady members and contributors and could bring in money, I said, “It’s time to think about a conference. Our first de novo project.” So, I talked to people I knew who had been involved in conferences, like the Myst fan conference, which is a very tiny thing that happens every year, like 100 people. But it’s been going for years and years. And of course Flourish had run a fan conference. In 2017 or 2018, I went to GDC with a bunch of business cards that said, “We want to run an interactive-fiction, adventure, and narrative-oriented game conference. Want to help us?” I handed one to everybody I talked to. I found a bunch of people who were interested in helping. Nick Montfort said he could get us a space at MIT for the event relatively cheap. We put up a call for speakers, a website, etc. We were coordinating with the IFTF Education Committee, which is run by Judith Pintar, who goes all the way back to Shades of Gray. Yeah, I had a great talk with Judith some years ago now. I had strong opinions about how a friendly conference should feel. We had to bring in lunch so people would sit around and have conversations rather than splitting up and running all over Cambridge. I wanted long breaks between talks so people would have space to socially interact. I wanted badges that didn’t distinguish between speakers and attendees; we’re all here, and we’re not going to have superstars. I wanted an open and honest tone. We made sure to have a keynote speaker who wasn’t an old fart. We didn’t want somebody like Scott Adams coming in and talking about what it was like back in the 1980s. You didn’t want to become a retro-gaming conference. Right. And we deliberately made the scope larger than just interactive fiction as found in the IF Comp or the IFDB. We didn’t want to limit the conference to those topics. We kept the admission price down to about $85. That was 2019. We had about 250 people, and everything miraculously went perfectly. The worst disaster was when the Dunkin’ Donuts guy was dropping off coffee and hot cocoa. One of the urns blew its spout and dumped gallons of cocoa all over the floor. Someone said, “I know where there’s a mop,” and went and got the mop and cleaned it up. Great, let’s have the rest of the conference! Local game companies made contributions, maybe $500 or $1000. Between that and the registration fees, the conference broke even. I admit that I threw in $2000 myself to make it balance, but that was because we splurged out and rented a bar on Sunday night. I said, okay, I’ll cover that, so that everybody can go out and have pizza and beer. A dream achieved: Andrew closes the 2019 NarraScope conference in Boston. Time for pizza and beer! It was a huge success. We said we would do it again next year. But of course next year was 2020. You know how that story goes. But it was exciting enough that we wanted to keep going anyway, so we had an online event in 2020. We skipped 2021, then came back in 2022 with an online conference. Then we had a hybrid model for 2023 in Pittsburgh and 2024 in Rochester. And that’s the history of the thing in a nutshell. By now I’ve become just an advisor, which is a great relief. How many people have attended the later conferences? It’s very easy to attend an online conference, so about 500 or 600 people signed up for those. But in person in Pittsburgh, there were about 100, either because people didn’t want to travel in the pandemic era or because we were offering an online option, so a lot of people who could have showed up decided to stay home and watch the stream instead. This year was a little higher, like 120. You were at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester this year? Yeah. The space was spread out, which turned out to be a win, because we had to walk through the museum and walk past all the cool exhibits. People were jumping out between talks to explore the museum. It was a really neat space — but unfortunately more expensive than a university. And there will be another conference in 2025? There absolutely will. It’s going to be in Philadelphia at Drexel University. NarraScope has not yet become big enough to replace GDC, but we’re optimistic. [smile] I don’t think you want that. It becomes very bureaucratic and soulless. Yeah, obviously. But Justin Bortnick, who is the current IFTF president, has been talking to GDC about booth space to present IFTF on the show floor. The Video Game History Foundation had a booth there this year. We thought, we’re educational too! We could do that! It may actually happen. Maybe we can wind up this conversation by talking about the current status of the IF community itself. For many years, it seemed to be quite stagnant in terms of numbers. We already talked about the outreach efforts that took place around 2005 and largely did not succeed. But about five years later, the hypertext systems started to come online. There was a big jump at that point. If you look at the number of games entered in the Comp, they actually trend down through the 2000s, then suddenly there’s a big spike around 2010 to 2012. They’ve stayed at quite a high level since then. Do you have a sense of whether these new, presumably younger people are jumping over to the parser-based stuff as well? There are new faces on both sides. There is now an active group of retro-fans interested in parser games. That is, people who are excited about making new games and running them on Commodore 64s and the like. We had to update Inform to fix the support for the version 3 Z-Machine, which had been broken over time as everybody was writing bigger and bigger games. Now people want to write small games again. And there is more interest in hybrid systems, intermediate models which are neither pure hypertext nor pure parser. For years and years, there were no new parser tools. I thought the last great parser development systems had already been implemented; people would stick with TADS 3 and Inform 7 forever. Then a parser system called Dialog appeared, which is a little bit different from them. But there is certainly more energy on the hypertext side, especially because a lot of us old farts have drifted away. I’m not writing games anymore, Emily Short isn’t writing text games anymore, Jon Ingold and Aaron Reed went off and did their things, Adam Cadre went off to work on film scripts. There are new people writing new games, but I think the pool is going to shrink over time. But that’s okay. Everything that Jon Ingold has done at Inkle Studios is informed by the early text games he worked on and how he wanted to expand that to reach a bigger audience. Everything Sam Barlow has done — Her Story, Telling L!es, Immortality — is informed by his experience writing text games. The same goes for Emily Short. It’s still part of the conversation. It’s just not the center of it anymore. Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. And there’s still theater. Yeah. Trends in interactive media, just the same as others forms of entertainment and art, come and go. They have their time, and then their time is over. I’m quite at peace with that. I’m sort of handicapped by the fact that I haven’t played IF Comp games in quite a while. I haven’t either. To be honest, I’ve played almost nothing made in the last ten years, just because I have so many old games on the syllabus for this site. Having too many games to play is not the worst problem to have, but it’s made me kind of a time traveler. I live in the past in that sense. I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. Ryan Veeder is younger than us. I do look at the Comp website sometimes to see what’s going on. I’ve noticed that it still seems to be a parser-based game that actually wins the thing most of the time. That’s a sign of something, I guess. Yeah. Maybe it’s a sign of old farts hanging on too long? But seriously, I think there is a new generation of parser-game authors. Whether it’s big enough to sustain itself after you and I are doddering in a nursing home, I don’t know. There’s been so much progress with computer understanding of natural language. A lot of it is associated with large language models, of course, which is a fraught subject in itself. But I could imagine a system — a front-end — that could take natural language and translate that into something a traditional parser could more readily understand, then funnel it through even an old text adventure. I’m kind of surprised I haven’t heard of anything like that. Someone did do that as an experiment and posted about it on the forum. Experimenting both with using LLMs on the input side to translate natural language into parserese, and also on the output side to translate generic room descriptions into more flowery, expanded text. I’m more interested in the input side because I like hand-crafted output, but that’s getting into the whole question of AI. Yes, I have no interest whatsoever in reading AI-generated text in any context. I think there wasn’t a lot of uptake on that idea just because the kind of people who are excited about AI aren’t excited about parser games in the first place. There have been several attempts to make an AI-generated text adventure, but they’ve all been by people who were not good at text adventures and didn’t know what they wanted out of it. There’s AI Dungeon, which uses an LLM to pretend to be a parser game. But because it’s all AI generated, it doesn’t really produce anything interesting. The people who are interested in making parser games are mostly old-fashioned artisans who want to hand-craft everything and are not motivated to dive into AI as a shiny new pool. It might be different if someone who was an established parser-game author jumped in and wholeheartedly tried to make it happen. Revolutions are the result of one person getting involved and building something that takes off. Someone has to actually do the work. And to this point, nobody has done that. It’s very possible the whole AI thing will collapse in six months anyway. I think that’s a very good possibility, but I think that if it does, it will leave behind some pieces in the rubble that are actually useful. Maybe a solution to our parsing problems can be one of them. But I’ve kept you long enough. Thanks so much for the talk! Thank you! Did you enjoy this article? If so, please think about pitching in to help me make many more like it. You can pledge any amount you like. Posted by Jimmy Maher on December 6, 2024 in Digital Antiquaria, Interactive Fiction Tags: dreamhold, hadean lands, plotkin, spider and web Andrew Plotkin December 6, 2024 at 4:58 pm Hi! I should say, the cake was the work of my mother, Diane. Full credit there. It was tasty. :) Disco Godfather December 7, 2024 at 5:42 pm Just wanted to comment that cake looked awesome. Moms making birthday cakes is something I miss from that era! Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 5:39 pm As soon as I read that Andrew worked for a startup that got acquired by Red Hat, I thought of “Being Andrew Plotkin”, which I played, many years after its release. For some reason, when I played the game, I assumed that it was set at Red Hat simply because that was a company with some nerdy “cool factor” in 2000. Of course, I should have figured that the author would know where Andrew worked and write the game accordingly. It sucks that Red Hat fired Andrew’s team. Andrew Plotkin December 6, 2024 at 5:52 pm Oh, I couldn’t move back to Pittsburgh fast enough. The Raleigh/Durham area was _not_ my home base. (Although, as it happened, Stephen Granade was living in Durham. So we got to hang out for that year.) Anyhow, the pile of Red Hat stock was excellent compensation for my trouble. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 5:44 pm >Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. Oof. But I don’t disagree, necessarily. We did have radio plays finally come back to life with podcasts, but I still don’t know what will do it with parser fiction. Maybe if a super-famous streamer gets into text adventures. The most prominent streamer I know who is a regular parser player is BillBull (did Gnome Ranger recently) but he’s at the level of 100-150 viewers, not the thousands. I do have two current projects which are text-game adjacent but in the non-disclosure phase, unfortunately. However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. I can’t even imagine trying to sell a parser game now, except for maybe getting the Infocom collection from Microsoft and giving it the same treatment Atari and Llamasoft got from Digital Eclipse. The only thing I still find is present in “the youth conversation” is Zork. They know about it. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is one of the official games on the Archipelago randomizer. I sometimes feel like with some of the really obscure games I write about I’m going to be the last one in history who ever plays it, so I try my best to give them all a good showing even if they’re a 30 minute game off a weird tapemag. Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 6:05 pm > However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. Unfortunately, when I read that, I mentally translate it as “likely not accessible to blind people.” That’s what tends to happen when you take a game that’s text and choice based at its core and wrap it in something like Unity to give it mainstream appeal, as Inkle did. Text-based parser games tend to be accessible by default (in this sense, if not in the wider sense of being approachable to the mainstream), simply because of the constraints of the original medium and the variety of available interpreters (though some interpreters, like Gargoyle, weren’t screen-reader-accessible last time I checked). Yes, yes, I should revive my long-dormant screen reader accessibility plugin for Unity. I presented a proof-of-concept demo at NarraScope 2022 (Andrew happened to be the one who introduced that talk). At this point I’d be happy to hand off the project to someone else who has more familiarity with (and patience for) Unity than I have. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 6:09 pm Nah, we’ve got voice acting. Chandler Groover December 6, 2024 at 10:23 pm >I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. I discovered IF in 2014. It’s not retro to me. It’s contemporary! Eriorg December 7, 2024 at 8:19 pm Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. Actually, it was in 2006 (on April 30). Jerzy December 8, 2024 at 3:48 am Jimmy, thank you for making and posting this interview. Fascinating stuff. Andrew, thanks for all your incredible work over the years! Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I love your description of it here, and I can imagine mocking up a (much simpler!) version to assign to my undergrad students. Many of them seem genuinely perplexed when I ask where they saved their files for an assignment — “it’s, like, in the cloud?!” — and maybe a praser-5-lite game could help motivate them to learn this stuff. Andrew Plotkin December 8, 2024 at 7:34 pm > Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I do, but wow, it’s really ancient. I mean it’s written in C, and not even ANSI C — it’s K&R style. I’m not sure it would be a great introduction to the filesystem. I was trying to *subvert* the idea of the filesystem by making it look more like a text adventure. Jerzy December 10, 2024 at 1:54 am That’s too bad but makes sense! I have a friend who likes to say “It subverts the genre to transcend the genre,” which is also a good description of many of your games, but perhaps not the best pedagogical approach for the filesystem newbies I have in mind :-) fform December 8, 2024 at 4:13 am Great interview. Regarding the discussion about AI at the end, while I can’t imagine “AI” (LLMs in this case) producing anything of interest, since it’s all just statistical prediction with no concept of what is actually being said, has anyone actually had an LLM AI play through a game? I’m curious now to know whether an LLM could statistically guess its’ way through a parser-based puzzle. stepped pyramids December 8, 2024 at 4:54 pm I’ve experimented both with using an LLM to solve a parser-based game and using it as a kind of “superparser” to translate natural language human input into commands. Both worked, but I don’t know how useful it is in practice (it’s kind of fun to translate “kiss my butt!” to “say insult to guard”, but I don’t know that it’s worth the latency).

Title: 4 Stocks That Have Surged in 2024 — Are They Really Worth the Investment?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s a little hard to believe, but 2024 has been a great year for the stock market. Despite all the conflict and uncertainty around the world, the S&P 500 has notched a 26% gain year-to-date, far outstripping its long-term average annual return of around 10%. Read More: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Be Aware: Why Skipping a Financial Advisor Could Be Your Biggest Money Mistake Passive investors, who try to replicate the performance of the total market by investing in index funds, have had a great year so far — but there are always some stocks that perform even better than the market average. Most investors who buy individual stocks typically are trying to beat the market and get those outsized returns. When a stock does beat the market, fear of missing out can make it very tempting to invest, but past performance is no guarantee of future success. What has gone up can always come down, so should you buy? Here’s a look at four stocks that have done well in 2024. Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move? YTD gain: 44.17% Better known by its former name, Raytheon Technologies, RTX Corporation is the second largest defense contractor in the United States. As a large conglomerate, it is engaged in a variety of businesses that include aerospace products, aircraft engines and missile systems. Given the amount of military aid that the U.S. is currently sending to several conflict zones, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a defense contractor is doing well. Whether or not that success will continue is unclear. Dr. Peter C. Earle, senior economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, noted that a new presidential administration could have an impact on RTX’s business. “Should the incoming Trump administration follow through on its pledges to force other nations to fend for themselves, the largest publicly traded defense contractors might be poised for a pullback,” Earle said. Verdict: NO Check Out: 3 Undervalued Stocks To Buy Before 2025, According to Experts YTD gain: 83.12% Investors have generally been very well rewarded for holding the stock of retail titan Walmart, and this year has been no exception, as the stock has seen more than double the return of the S&P 500. However, there are some possibly very troubling headwinds that have the potential to make a massive impact on Walmart’s operations. “A cornerstone of the Trump campaign has been tariffs and other forms of trade protectionism. If tariffs of the type which have been discussed are put in place — 60%, 100%, 200%, and so on — retaliatory tariffs would follow. Those could, in turn, devastate companies that rely on imports, [such as] Walmart,” Earle said, citing the fact that Walmart imports many of its goods from Chinese suppliers. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 69.97% Abercrombie & Fitch is a specialty retailer of apparel whose stock has been absolutely surging through 2024. Although down from its mid-year high share price of almost $200, it has still had eye-popping returns for the year so far. Derrick Fung is the CEO of Signals, an investment intelligence platform that tracks consumer spending data to help investors anticipate market movements. His platform’s data indicates a down trend on companies that sell “nice to have” non-durable products — things like higher end cosmetics, apparel and home furnishings. “Our data has been showing a down trend on [ANF] — i.e. we’ve gotten a SELL Signal on all these names in the last 45 days — and the signal has worked on all of them,” Fung said. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 192.98% Chipmaker Nvidia has made a lot of headlines over the last year, as it has skyrocketed to become the second largest company in the world, right behind Apple. Its specialty is in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are highly prized for artificial intelligence applications, and its business has surged along with the wave of hype surrounding generative AI. It’s hard for a business to maintain such a stunning level of growth, so investors may be wondering if it’s time to get off of the rocket. However, for the stock analysts that cover Nvidia, there remains a high degree of enthusiasm for the business. Of the 63 analysts currently making recommendations, 57 of them rate NVDA as a Buy or a Strong Buy. That’s over 90%, and that level of consensus among analysts is often rare.

Title: 5 Stock Buys And Sells From Top Billionaire Investors

Over the past 30 months, the reported moves of billionaire investors were a major consideration in the strategies we have used to construct our two Forbes Billionaire Investor model portfolios, but they were not the only factor. We also sought out stocks that had compelling value appeal with low debt levels and strong business fundamentals, which means stocks trading at depressed valuations that still produce rising revenues and profits. Except for Walt Disney (DIS), which had exceptional interest from activist billionaire investors, we’ve required our stocks to pay dividends. We also wanted to see evidence of recent insider buying among company managers and directors. The strategy has yielded great success. When we launched Forbes Billionaire Investor in September 2022, we bought large-cap future home runs like retail success stories Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS +118%) and Ross Stores (ROST +90%), as well as “Magnificent Seven” member Microsoft (MSFT +84%). Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune of $147 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, more than triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers taken from their most recent SEC filings. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings which owns online marketplace Temu. Another recent China buy from Tepper is JD.com.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. "We let the machine decide more," Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Position size: $1.73 billion Activity: 5% Microsoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago: Analysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive." At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock. Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The head of a $210 billion asset management firm has decided to unload a massive pile of assets. Billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, has sold off 68% of the firm’s Walmart (WMRT) position – 8.1 million shares worth about $745 million – according to its latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data compiled by TickerTracker, Millennium has also significantly decreased its holdings of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). In total, the shares sold by Millennium Management in Q3 amount to more than $20 billion. Meanwhile, Englander has reportedly increased the firm’s exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) as well as Microsoft (MSFT) and Spotify (SPOT). Englander is also shifting his focus in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, selling 95% of the firm’s shares in Rivian (RIVN) to get into the electric air flying taxi company Archer Aviation (ACHR), a favorite of ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Englander acquired 3,247,428 shares of the company, while Wood has been accumulating ACHR since August of 2023. ACHR is down 53% from its all-time high of $18.49 but up over 204% in the last month alone. Millenium Management has recorded 162% gains over the last four years. Other billionaire portfolio shakeups reported recently include Bill Ackman’s recent accumulation of asset manager Brookfield Corporation and apparel giant Nike, and Ken Fisher’s $800,000,000 bet on the US banking industry with his purchase of JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

Title: Warren Buffett once called an investment a ‘terrible long-term asset’ — but he’s holding $325B of it today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Warren Buffett has never shied away from calling out underperforming investments. Among his most scathing critiques? An asset virtually everyone owns — cash. Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how In a 2008 op-ed for The New York Times, Buffett warned, “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value.” Buffett had a point. Interest rates were low in 2008, so cash didn’t pay much. Meanwhile, inflation steadily eroded the purchasing power of money, diminishing cash's real value over time. Fast forward to today, and the story seems to have taken an unexpected turn. By the end of Q3 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves had swelled to a staggering $325.2 billion. The sheer size of Buffett’s cash pile has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about his strategy. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan told Reuters that the growing cash reserve “begs questions about whether Buffett thinks stocks are overvalued or an economic downturn is coming, or is trying to build cash for a big acquisition.” Similarly, CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert interpreted Berkshire’s cash hoarding as signaling a "risk-off" mindset, according to the report, which could lead investors to worry about its implications for the economy and markets. Buffett himself has addressed concerns about his cash strategy, explaining his cautious approach during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year. “I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated, emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.” Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.” While Buffett is holding a massive cash pile, his warning about its drawbacks remains relevant. Inflation continues to chip away at the purchasing power of your hard-earned money. Putting your money to work not only helps you grow your wealth but also shields it from inflation’s long-term erosive effects. Read more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024 Here are three popular ways to make your cash work harder: As one of the most successful investors, Buffett built his fortune on investing in equities — particularly U.S. stocks. In his 2016 letter to shareholders, he expressed unwavering confidence in American businesses: “American business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.” Berkshire’s performance serves as a powerful testament to that principle. From 1964 to 2023, the company delivered an astonishing overall gain of 4,384,748%. While Buffett is legendary for picking winning companies, he’s an even bigger advocate for a simpler, tried-and-true strategy: investing in an S&P 500 index fund. “In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” he famously stated. This straightforward approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across various industries, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. Following this strategy has never been easier. Today, a variety of apps allow you to invest in index funds like the S&P 500 seamlessly — some will even round up spare change from everyday purchases to build your portfolio. It’s a low-effort, high-impact way to grow your wealth over time. Real estate has long been considered a reliable hedge against inflation, thanks to its intrinsic value and income-generating potential. When inflation rises, property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. At the same time, rental income tends to go up, providing landlords with a revenue stream that adjusts for inflation. This combination makes real estate an attractive option for preserving and growing wealth during periods of escalating price levels. In 2022, Buffett stated that if you offered him “1% of all the apartment houses in the country” for $25 billion, he would “write you a check.” Whether the economy is booming or in a recession, people need a place to live. And with real estate prices rising to unaffordable levels in many parts of the country, renting has become the only option for many people. These days, you don’t need to purchase a property outright to invest in real estate. REITs are a popular choice for those looking to gain exposure to this essential market. Companies like American Homes 4 Rent (AMH) focus on single-family rental homes, while Equity Residential (EQR) targets multifamily housing in high-demand urban areas. These companies can serve as a starting point for further research. Meanwhile, crowdfunding platforms allow everyday investors to own shares in rental properties without the large down payments or management headaches traditionally associated with real estate ownership. Before you invest, make sure you understand all the risks of real estate crowdfunding. Keep in mind, there’s no guarantee of receiving rental income deposits from your investment and your money will be locked up until the property is sold, so there’s no liquidity. Gold is another popular hedge against inflation. The reason is straightforward: the yellow metal can’t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks like fiat money. And because its value isn’t tied to any one currency or economy, gold could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty. This unique characteristic has earned it the reputation of being a “safe haven” asset. When inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, gold's appeal as a stable store of value often grows, driving up demand. Investors have already taken note of its resilience. So far in 2024, gold prices have surged by 27%, surpassing $2,600 per ounce. Economist Peter Schiff sees substantial further upside for gold. “If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or even to $100,000. There’s no limit because, again, gold isn’t changing — it’s the value of the dollar that’s decreasing,” he recently stated. There are multiple ways to invest in gold. Car insurance in America now costs a stunning $2,329/year on average — but here’s how 2 minutes can save you more than $600 in 2025 I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 3 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

Title: Trying new social media tactics to stand out in ‘brutal’ job market

From cash rewards to “desperate” banners, more job seekers are getting creative to land their next employment. SAN FRANCISCO — Job hunting for Nadeera Waduwara Kankanamalage has been nothing short of frustrating over the past two years. So a week before Thanksgiving, the 32-year-old Austin resident took an unlikely approach to landing a new tech gig: He went on LinkedIn offering a $3,000 reward to anyone who connects him to his next job. Kankanamalage’s written plea in his post sums up what many job seekers are experiencing right now: The market is “brutal” and the number of rejections are “a gut punch.” “It’s a whatever-it-takes mentality,” he said in an interview with the Washington Post. “Hopefully it’s a good signal for a potential employer that I’m proactive, and I’m trying to solve this problem in a creative way.” Exasperated by too much competition, no return communications, and automated rejection letters, job seekers are getting creative on social media to get a foot in the door. Many of them have spent months looking for roles, applying to hundreds of openings and turning to social media with seemingly nothing to lose. Some are offering rewards for job leads, tagging employers in their posts in the hopes of getting a comment, and getting vulnerable with videos and banners that say they are “desperate” for work. Their approaches represent a marked shift from how people used to handle layoffs and employment. That shift “might be a by-product of people’s greater willingness to be open,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School. “Not too long ago, people would’ve been mortified to say they were open to work.” Kankanamalage said he is trying different things to see “what sticks.” “I need to be creative in getting myself into the workforce again,” he said. While more people are using social media networks to amplify their job hunt, unemployment remains relatively low in the United States at 4.1 percent, just above the 54-year record low last year of 3.4%, according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong labor market is expected to continue into next year under the new presidential administration, House predicts. Despite the strong labor market, some industries are experiencing substantial churn as they reconfigure their workforce to address evolving business needs like artificial intelligence, he added. The share of people who have been unemployed for six months or more is increasing, while many workers may be less likely to relocate due to low mortgage rates that they scored during the pandemic, he said. Some job seekers have taken to TikTok, shedding tears as they explain their layoffs and ask for help. Others are making creative videos to show their skills, or producing video resumés. Then there’s the multitude of people who are making their case on the professional networking platform LinkedIn. Laura Martyna, a recruiting and human resources professional, created a mini marketing campaign for herself on LinkedIn after being laid off in September. Even though the 43-year-old in Concord, N.C., has more than 15 years of experience, including at Amazon, she said she’s only landed two interviews out of hundreds of job applications. When her dream job at Eli Lilly opened, she listed the reasons the company should hire her. She tagged the company, as well as former colleagues and bosses, whom she asked to add comments to support her effort. She also tagged the hiring manager, who responded with appreciation for the enthusiasm. “I don’t know how else to get flashing lights to get attention,” Martyna said the day after she posted. “It’s worth a shot. Nothing else is working.” Days later, Martyna got an automated rejection letter. But shortly after, the hiring manager asked to set up a meeting to learn more about her. For Martyna, the post paid off. Other job seekers have tried to cast wide nets by using banners that border their LinkedIn profile pictures with the phrase Open to Work. It’s one of the most common banners used, but some who’ve added it complain that it lures scams and bots. As an alternative, some LinkedIn members created their own banners using words like motivated or excited instead. One banner, made by a designer out of Britain, briefly went viral a couple of months ago. It pulled no punches with one blunt word: desperate. Jordan Dye, a 27-year-old, who’s been trying to break into the cybersecurity industry, added it to his profile immediately after seeing it. “I saw an opportunity, took it and then it blew up way bigger than I thought,” said the Dallas resident, who previously had relatively few LinkedIn connections. “I have over 1,600 followers now.” Dye said his post explaining the banner got about a half-million views, connections, and a lot of discussion. But he didn’t hear from hiring managers. He later changed his banner to Dying, playing off his name and the widespread desperation in the market. Dye, who for now isn’t using either banner, estimated he’s applied to 4,500 jobs since June 2023. Another job seeker, Rita Williams, initially used the banner in solidarity with the “desperate” movement. But the 38-year-old, who’s seeking a job as a technical analyst for a social justice reform organization, still displays it after two months, eight interviews, and 500 applications. “It seems like it became an indicator of, ‘Wow this person has been through it,’” she said about the banner. “It generates interest, and people are kinder.” She said she’s also in the process of creating a nonprofit. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” she said. LinkedIn said people who use the Open to Work banner on average are 40% more likely to receive messages from recruiters and 20% more likely to receive messages from other members. To avoid scams, LinkedIn said job seekers should look for verification badges on job postings and profiles. Given LinkedIn’s easy-apply button, and generative AI, which can quickly tailor a resumé for a specific job, employers and recruiters are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of candidates. But two recruiters were mixed on whether social media posts are a reliable way to stand out in the candidate pool. “Some of them are entertaining, but I don’t know if I’d hire based off that,” said Mindy Totaro, a senior creative recruiter at staffing agency Aquent. “Do you understand the skills or is it about just trying to get someone to respond?” Instead, Totaro says job seekers should focus on building relationships with recruiters and hiring managers, even if they don’t pay off right away, and ensure that their resumé skills match the job. It’s also best to be among the first applicants because recruiters sometimes have just 24 hours to present top candidates. To see job postings faster, follow recruiters and employers on social media, she said. But Thomas Vick, a technology employment trends expert and regional president with recruiting firm Robert Half, said creative posts — when done right — may give job seekers a leg up. “Anything that differentiates you in a positive, productive manner, especially if you can highlight how it can be beneficial to the business … it certainly can help,” he said, adding that candidates should try to stand out. Some job seekers exhausted by the void of silence and repeated rejections are becoming brutally honest. Feeling invisible after hundreds of applications, Chuck Williams let his LinkedIn network know that he’s on the verge of losing his house. Williams, a 36-year-old husband and father of two in Richland, Wash., said he was laid off just two months after purchasing the house. Six months later, he made his vulnerable LinkedIn plea for leads. “I genuinely needed to be honest about where I’m at and what I feel,” he said. Since the post, he’s received at least 3,000 comments and messages, mostly from people facing similar struggles. The post hasn’t led to a job, but it did land him two interviews with hiring managers. The outpouring of support that came from that post taught Williams a lesson: “There isn’t a silver bullet here. But what I think resonates with people is honesty.”

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed. AI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data. As businesses continue to innovate with AI, balancing its advantages and potential risks will be crucial for future growth. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December. At the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace’s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis’s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis’s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries. Wetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI’s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and semiconductor devices, offering various fabrication processes. Its products are used in industries like high-performance computing, smartphones, automotive, and consumer electronics. According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is in talks with Nvidia to produce its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's Arizona facility, which is set to begin volume production in 2025. The chips, currently made in Taiwan, are in high demand for generative AI and computing tasks. While the Arizona plant will handle the chips' front-end process, packaging will still take place in Taiwan due to the absence of CoWoS technology in the U.S. facility. Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) Arizona plant already serves customers like Apple and AMD. This expansion is part of TSMC's significant investment in Phoenix, supported by U.S. government subsidies to boost domestic chip production. Overall TSM ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump’s favourite index is tipped to rally further in 2025. But will he get in the way?

Donald Trump’s vetting of cabinet picks second time round may have thrown up some blunders, with his nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) this week following the fate of Matt Gaetz’s short-lived candidacy for attorney general. Chad Chronister, currently a Florida sheriff, withdrew his name to run the DEA from consideration – though Trump says he pulled the plug – on Wednesday as a result of uproar among Republicans over his arrest of a pastor in 2020 for holding large services during a Covid lockdown. It follows Gaetz withdrawing his name for lawyer-in-chief last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the band Trump is putting together elsewhere – including hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent being picked as treasury secretary, oil industry veteran Chris Wright as energy secretary, stockbroking firm Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, and Paul Atkins, a free marketeer and crypto-friendly lawyer, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission – has been warmly received at a constituency close to his heart: Wall Street. The stock market, as we learned during Trump’s first term in office, is Trump’s favoured barometer of success – having regularly peppered speeches back then with the question, “How’s your 401(K) doing?” That referred to the stock-laden retirement savings vehicles used by more than 100 million Americans. New York’s S&P 500 index of blue-chip US companies, the world’s most widely followed equities index, has advanced almost 5.5 per cent since Trump outflanked Kamala Harris just over a month ago – bringing its advance so far this year to 28 per cent, and to an all-time high. Investors have committed almost $140 billion (€132.3 billion) of fresh money to US equity funds since the election, with November being the busiest month for inflows on records stretching back to 2000, on hopes the incoming administration will unleash sweeping tax cuts and reforms to help corporate America, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing figures from market data provider EPFR. The S&P 500, which has a major influence on stock markets globally, is on track to reach 6,500 points by the end of next year, according to median forecast of 48 equity strategists recently polled by Reuters. That points to about a 7 per cent advance from current levels. Former Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment have quit the Irish market in the past 15 months and moved their main listings to the US with an aim of ultimately joining the S&P 500. Smurfit Kappa secured direct entry to the index in July when it merged with a US cardboard box-making rival to form Smurfit Westrock. But never has the US market been dominated by so few. The so-called magnificent seven group of high-performing stocks – including Nvidia, the maker of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computer chips, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon – have driven the broader market higher in 2024. Nvidia’s 200 per cent surge alone has fuelled a fifth of the S&P 500’s gain this year. And the seven are seen leading the way again in 2025, according to strategists. There’s a lot of hope priced into equities right now. But investors don’t have to look too far to see red flags. Following this year’s rally, companies on the S&P 500 are trading at an average of 23 times expected earnings, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates. That’s well over the 10-year average of about 18. Tech valuations are even more stretched. Joe Davis, chief economist of Vanguard, the world’s second-largest manager, warned this week that the market had overestimated the short-term potential of AI technology, increasing the risk of a price “correction”. He said some tech valuations were approaching those of 1997 – referring to the tech bubble era. While JP Morgan strategists were upbeat on equities in their 2025 market outlook, published this week, as central banks continue to ease interest rates and the new US administration embarks on a programme of deregulation, they warned of a risk of “disruptive Trump policies triggering a crash landing”. Historically high prices for US housing, crypto currencies (Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Thursday) and gold, as well as low corporate bond market interest rates, relative to risk, broaden the potential fallout. The Central Bank of Ireland highlighted in a report this week that there is a “widening disconnect” between economic uncertainty – also stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and fears about a possible US-China clash over Taiwan – and current low volatility in global equity and debt markets. This increases the chances of a “sharp repricing of assets”, it warned. Trump 2.0, with a return of “America first”, has already seen the president-elect suggest universal tariffs on all goods imported to the US and sharply higher levies on Chinese goods. He has also threatened neighbouring Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent taxes on goods from both unless they stem immigration to the US and flows of drugs. Economists have said tariffs will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to reverse course on its current cycle of easing interest rates. “The effects would be inflationary in the short term – with companies facing higher input costs and consumers paying more for finished goods; [and be] a drag on US GDP in the medium term, while underpinning still-high benchmark interest rates,” said S&P Global Ratings. GDP stands for gross domestic product. Inflation could also be stoked if mass deportations of illegal immigrants kick in – or people start self-deporting in droves – under Trump. Fewer workers in some industries could put upward pressure on wages. Stock market bulls argue Trump will be quick to change course on any economically disruptive policies if they lead to a stock market sell-off. But that won’t prevent volatility in the meantime. And incoming cabinet members should know from the experience of the walking wounded from Trump’s first administration, he’ll always find someone else to blame.
