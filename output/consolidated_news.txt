Title: Post-Presidential Election: Stocks, Bonds, And The Fed

Despite control of the House of Representatives still being unclear, stock prices and bonds yields ... [+] moved sharply higher in the wake of the Presidential election. The S&P 500 rose by 4.7% for the week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), surged ahead by 8.3%. Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stock Returns While it is now certain that Donald Trump has regained the presidency and the Republicans will control the Senate, enough votes are still being counted to make the fate of the House of Representatives unclear. Betting markets and other sources indicate that the Republicans should retain a slight majority in the House. Either outcome has historically satisfactory outcomes for stock returns. U.S. Government Control: Stock Returns (1933-2023) Stocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Focusing on the worst historical return, the decline of 10.2% was after President Obama’s election, with the country mired in recession and a global financial crisis. The results thus far have been better than average, with the S&P 500 rising 3.7% since the election. Politics is not the only factor influencing stocks and is usually not the most critical factor. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here. Stock Returns Between Presidential Election and Year-End (1952-2020) According to Strategas, the year after an open presidential election, with the incumbent not running, the returns from stocks have generally been positive if an economic downturn is avoided. Looking at the two negative results, the U.S. economy entered into recession in the fourth quarter of 1969 and the first quarter of 2001. The year 2000 also marked the popping of the internet stock bubble. Stock Returns 1-Year After Open Presidential Elections While the evidence shows that investors should not make macro investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs, it is worth noting the likely policies that could benefit specific companies or industries. President Trump is expected to wield tariffs as a weapon, though China should be his primary target rather than a broad tariff on all countries. Investors should be mindful of China’s exposure to companies in both supply chain and end markets. The Trump administration should be more amenable to mergers and acquisitions than the Biden administration. Regulatory burdens are likely to be reduced, which has already shown up in the performance of bank stocks, which have outperformed the S&P 500 since the election. If the Republicans retain the House, a corporate tax cut becomes more likely. Goldman Sachs estimates that a corporate statutory tax rate reduction to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. Higher-taxed companies, which include more domestically focused companies and small-caps, would benefit more if the corporate tax rate is reduced. Bond yields have been rising since mid-September as the economy has proved more resilient than expected, and increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle will allow the economy to avoid a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked after President Trump’s victory but has since settled down slightly higher than before the results. The behavior of bond yields is analogous to many assets after the election, with a knee-jerk reaction followed by some moderation or stability. U.S. Treasury Yields The silver lining of the increase in yields is that it is due to expectations of better economic growth rather than increasing inflation. Looking at the real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield illustrates that inflation fears are not the culprit for the rise in yields. Rising yields typically act as a headwind for stocks, but better economic growth leads to higher earnings expectations, which can offset the drag. Economic growth expectations rose, reflected in the sharp increase of real yields after Trump’s election, but have since moderated to slightly above the level prior. Real U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield The post-election boost in confidence about economic growth translated to a spike in the outperformance of the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks versus the less sensitive defensives. The outperformance has moderated slightly but remains well above pre-election levels. Small-cap stocks, defined as the Russell 2000, have seen sharp outperformance after the election. The Russell 2000 has risen by 6.2% since the election. Multiple factors have likely driven this small-cap re-awakening. Small-cap stocks are typically more economically sensitive and would be more significant beneficiaries of any corporate tax cut. In addition, many smaller companies are more domestically focused and have less exposure to any tariff trade war with China. Banks, which soared by 8.2% since the election, are likely to benefit from less regulation but also get a tailwind from lower tax rates and better economic growth. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks Within the S&P 500, 102 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With the earnings season nearing completion, the pace of the third-quarter earnings reports slows drastically, with only 11 S&P 500 companies scheduled. S&P 500 Earnings Season Among the companies reporting this week are Home Depot (HD), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Walt Disney (DIS). According to FactSet, the healthcare sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. With the earnings season almost complete, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.3% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, and an improvement over the previous week’s 5.1%. S&P 500 Earnings Season As expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) on Thursday. Markets are pricing in another 25 basis points cut in December, but it is far from a sure thing. Chair Powell’s remarks added little to clarify the situation beyond noting that this was not a time for full-throated forward guidance but that monetary policy is still “restrictive,” which supports better-than-fifty percent odds of a December cut. Incoming economic data will remain crucial to the pace of future rate cuts. On Wednesday, consumer inflation (CPI) will be parsed for signs of a revival in inflation. Friday’s retail sales will give insights into the health of the U.S. consumer and, thus, the economy, but it is likely to be noisy due to the pull forward of purchases due to the port strike and hurricanes. Hurricane damage from Helene and Milton should boost building material sales in this month's report. Number of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stocks and bonds had a knee-jerk reaction to the election, generally followed by some moderation or stability. Fed Chair Powell provided little guidance for the future pace of rate cuts, so this week’s consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales data will be closely watched. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently holds Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Expect a ‘huge sucking sound’ of foreign capital flooding in as U.S. dominance of global finance increases, top economist says

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street has been flying high as an expected Republican sweep in the election drives hopes for lower taxes and deregulation, and that makes U.S. financial markets more attractive to the rest of the world, a top economist said. In an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian was asked if investors should expect a positive growth shock that's accompanied by more inflation. "The direction of travel is clear: More growth, slightly higher inflation, a higher public sector borrowing requirement, and a huge sucking sound where a lot of foreign capital will end up in the U.S.," he replied. The magnitudes of those trends will become more apparent when policies from the incoming Trump administration become clearer—and when the people who will carry them out become known, El-Erian added. Just days after the presidential election, talk of potential Cabinet appointments is already ramping up. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Robert Lighthizer, who was U.S. Trade Representative during Trump's first term, was asked to fill the post again. Meanwhile, the job of Treasury secretary will likely be offered to a financier, the FT added, with hedge fund managers Scott Bessent and John Paulson seen as possibilities. Meanwhile, the rest of the world may have more trouble coping with a period of faster growth and hotter inflation, adding to America's relative edge, El-Erian said. "This is a period in which U.S. dominance of the global system is going to increase, both for positive reasons and for negative reasons in the short term," he explained. "The rest of the world simply cannot build enough pipes around the U.S. They're trying and they've been doing it, but these pipes are very small compared to the size of the U.S." Indeed, despite fears that Trump's tax cuts, tariffs, and immigration crackdown will be inflationary and worsen deficits, bonds yields have come back down after soaring in the immediate aftermath of the election. El-Erian argued that's because U.S. bonds have become more attractive relative to those from other advanced economies. Continued demand for Treasuries would help the federal government finance what's expected to be an explosion of debt under another Trump presidency. Ahead of the election, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that his policies could add $7.5 trillion to the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. But if investors, especially "bond vigilantes," balk at the enormous volumes of debt the Treasury Department auctions, they could send yields higher and raise borrowing costs across key segments of the economy, like mortgage rates. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Tuesday, however, BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink said faster economic growth would help make U.S. debt more manageable. "If GDP rises at an average of 3% in real terms over the next five years, the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio would stay roughly stable at a high, but reasonable, level," he wrote.

Title: 3 Reasons Why A Crypto Dollar Will Come Sooner Than Expected
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/09/3-reasons-why-a-crypto-dollar-will-come-sooner-than-expected/
Time Published: 2024-11-09T19:54:38Z
Full Content:
A crypto dollar is not as far-fetched as it might sound As the ramifications of the recent U.S. Presidential election are analyzed by financial markets and crypto investors, one underlying fact might take some crypto investors, policy advocates, and entrepreneurs by surprise. Despite, or perhaps because of, the increased interest and investment that the crypto economy and sector had received during the recent election cycle – powered in no small part by the nearly $200 million spent by crypto lobbyists – the trends toward wider adoption and utilization continue to accelerate. Such a statement might bring to mind examples such as spot ETF products, stablecoin issuers obtaining larger shares of the payment space, or even the launch of stablecoins by TradFi institutions. The above facts and trends are correct, and have driven broader and deeper integration of cryptoassets throughout the economy, but one other institution has recently published comprehensive research on the implications, opportunities, and challenges of stablecoin adoption. The October 2024 report by the U.S. Treasury to Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee - over 100 pages of quantitative analytics and tables regarding borrowing and other Treasury activities – could have reasonably been overlooked in the recent deluge of media information and discourse. That said, in that report there are over 20 pages of graphics and data analyzing the status of stablecoins, use how these stablecoins are using and connected to the U.S. Treasury market, and the benefits of tokenized Treasury activities. Put simply, these data points paint a road map for how and why the U.S. Treasury could quickly and comprehensively become a major user of tokenized payments and stablecoins; let’s take a look at a few of them. One of the more interesting data points presented in this report is that the continued growth and proliferation of stablecoins has also led to a increase in the demand for short-dated Treasuries. Citing the analytics of Tether (issuer of USDT) $68.3% of total collateral held by the organization was in the form of U.S. Treasury Bills. In addition to the direct purchase of Treasuring by stablecoin issuers to serve as collateral for the tokens themselves, the report also puts forward another way in which stablecoins are increasing the demand for Treasuries. When compared to the larger cryptoassets and products that provide exposure to bitcoin (such as spot ETFs), stablecoins are viewed as lower risk, which can funnel investor dollars into these instruments during periods of market volatility. Additionally, as the digital asset sector grows, Treasuries may serve a role as an indirect hedge against inflation and – ultimately – a low volatility on-chain alternative to stablecoins. As the dollar faces increasing competition for its role as global reserve currency, and foreign buyers of debt may reallocate funds in future, stablecoins may grow into an alternative buyer in the future. Another fact that might surprise some crypto investors is that, even after years of an ambiguous regulatory environment and antagonistic regulations, tokenized Treasuries already exist, albeit at a modest level of approximately $2 billion. For example, tokenized treasury funds are already available to investors via funds such as Blackrock’s BUIDL Fund and Franklin Templeton’s On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to these projects, including the one via Blackrock (also the leading player in the spot bitcoin ETF space) other options include Ondo Financial, Hashnote, and CoinShares. On top of these projects, Onyx at JP Morgan leverages tokenized Treasuries to provide intraday Treasury-backed repo solutions, with the Treasury also noting that smart contracts allow simplification and automation of Treasury transactions. In other words the U.S. Treasury, while contending with other U.S. regulators and policymakers that have pursued an antagonistic approach, is well aware of the benefits of tokenized Treasuries as well as the reality that multiple projects leveraging these benefits already exist. Improvements to current clearing and settlement processes, more efficient collateral management, and better transparency via tokenized records are all duly noted as benefits for increased tokenization of the U.S. Treasury market. Much has been written about the potential for a strategic bitcoin reserve, with the discussion around this idea only increasing with the election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States. As exciting and arguably important as such a plan and strategic initiative is, it is only a partial solution to the problems and challenges facing the U.S. dollar and broader U.S. competitive interests. In order to remain competitive on a global basis, attract the talent necessary to succeed and lead the various industries of the future (including blockchain and tokenized transactions) the U.S. policy apparatus will need to embrace a multi-pronged approach to tokenization. A strategic bitcoin reserve is an excellent first step toward more comprehensive integration of tokenized transactions, but leveraging tokenization and blockchain transactions to improve the expand U.S. Treasury markets is an essential component of any U.S. oriented crypto plan. Crypto dollars are virtually guaranteed, and might reach mainstream adoption sooner than many crypto investors expect. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Equities Soar On Trump Election Despite A Slowing Economy

The Dow Jones gained more than 1500 points on Wednesday after Trump won the 270 electoral votes needed to become the 47th President of the United States, and the volume was twice the normal level. By Friday, as shown in the table, all four major indexes closed at all-time record highs. That says something about Wall Street’s view of which candidate’s economic policies were better for long-term economic growth. As of the close of business on Friday (November 8th), for the week, the major indexes are up in the 5%-6% range with the small cap Russell 2000 up more than 8.5%. For that small cap index, the YTD change is just 9%, so almost all of its year-to-date gain came this week! Equity Markets The Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA, GOOG) have also been hot this week with three (NVDA, AMZN, and TSLA) setting new all-time highs, Nvidia and Amazon on Thursday (11/7/24) and Tesla on Friday. Magnificent 7 Prior to the election, markets had been flat. This can be traced to the disappointing guidance from Microsoft and Meta. Apparently, the markets feel confident that President-elect Trump’s economic policies will be positive for U.S. businesses. For example, his stated tariff policy would make it easier for U.S. made goods to compete with foreign imports, especially those from China, many of which are subsidized by the Chinese government. Here is a comparison of some key market and economic data from 2016 (when Trump’s first Presidential term began) to today. Data comparison of Trump's first Presidential term and today Of note, these critical ratios are much more constraining now than they were back in 2016. For example, the debt/GDP ratio of 123% may act as a constraint on Trump’s ambitions. Of concern is the debt servicing cost. If this pierces 30%, the costs of Treasury debt will rise significantly, and there could be more rating agency downgrades. The fact that the Republicans control the Senate and are likely to control the House of Representatives, would, in the past, indicate a more conservative approach to spending and deficits. That hasn’t been the case of late. We’ll see what happens with this Congress. The large fiscal deficits during periods of healthy economic growth has a two-fold negative impact: 1) A rising Debt/GDP ratio has consequences for interest rates (i.e., higher than they otherwise would be) with debt servicing costs set to become a major fiscal headache; 2) A rising Debt/GDP ratio could be a threat to the dollar’s world reserve currency status, a status that keeps demand for dollars and Treasury securities high. A loss of such status would surely raise the cost of U.S. Treasury borrowing. We came across the chart below from the folks at Y-Charts that shows the S&P 500 performance under the 12 U.S. Presidents since 1960. For 10 of the 12, the S&P 500 was higher at the end of their terms than at the beginning. Only under Presidents Nixon and G. W. Bush was the S&P 500 lower at the end of their tenure than it was at the beginning. As noted above, the financial markets have high hopes for a second Trump term. S&P 500 performance under the 12 U.S. Presidents since 1960 On Thursday (November 7th), the Fed lowered the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) to 4.50%-4.75%, a move that was widely anticipated by the markets. Of interest was Chairman Powell’s response at the press conference to a question regarding the +2.7% year/year inflation rate as calculated using the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Powell’s response was to refer the audience to the six-month and three-month annualized rates. Both of these are well below the 2% Fed target. That was quite a dovish response. (We note here that in past blogs we have referred to the much lower annualized rates in the three- and six-month indexes; giving us confidence that we would be seeing much lower rates of inflation going forward.) Also of interest was Powell’s comment that “the labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressure,” indicating that there are signs of labor market softening emerging in the data. Again, we have noted such in our past blogs. The surprise of the press conference occurred when Powell was asked if he would step down if asked to do so by President-elect Trump. His response was a short one-word answer with an irritated tone: “NO!” Later in the press conference he indicated that, because the Fed is independent from the Federal Government, under the law, the President could not remove him or any of the other Fed Governors. Note: His term expires in May 2026. We don’t see this as a big deal. This Powell led Fed had already embarked on an easing cycle in September, well before the election. Given the duration of business cycles, the Fed isn’t likely to raise rates again during the remainder of Powell’s term. So, the only likely point of disagreement between Powell and Trump can only be the speed at which the Fed lowers those rates. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) showed up at -0.5% in September from their August reading. This is the 7th consecutive negative reading. The Index is down -4.8% from a year earlier, and as shown on the chart, that year/year percentage change hasn’t been positive since mid-2022. The Coincident Economic Indicators still showed up as positive (+1.4%), and while that means that the economy is still growing, the Leading Indicators are forecasting that the future road may be rocky. Here’s some food for thought: In January ’08, LEI was -4.9% year/year (quite similar to today’s -4.8%). The Coincident Indicator was +1.5% (again like today’s +1.4%). What happened next? The Great Recession! Further back, in February ’01, the LEI was -5.0% year/year, and the Coincident was +1.7%. Again, a Recession was not far off. Some economists want to write-off the predictive power of the LEI. We’re not in that camp. Let’s not forget the huge fiscal deficits have played a major role, and are likely the major reason why the economy remains in growth mode. As noted above, a continuation of such deficits endangers the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Leading Economic Indicators The left side of the chart shows the slowdown in Nonresidential Construction. It is rather dramatic with the year/year percentage change falling from more than 20% in 2023 to 5% late in 2024. On the residential side, the growth rate, which peaked in 2021 at over 30%, is now also at a 5% annual rate. While both are still positive, they reinforce our thesis that the economy’s growth rate is slowing. Construction Nonresidential and Residential Spending Since the end of September, interest rates have spiked (see chart). This was likely due to the +2.8% growth in GDP in Q3 and the Street’s expectation that such growth would continue. The labor market appears to be weakening, with payroll growth in the Non-Farm Payroll Survey in October at just +12K (and the Household Survey showed -368K with a falloff of -164K in Full-Time positions). Data shows that consumers spending growth has been far beyond their advancement in income. As Herb Stein famously remarked, “Something that cannot go on forever, won’t!” In the May to September period, income grew +1.1%, but spending grew far faster, at a +3.3% rate. The result has been a rapid drawdown in savings. That cannot continue for long. Consumption growth is likely to slow significantly in 2025 and we think that interest rates will come down by 2 percentage points or more, from a 4.5% Fed Funds rate today to the 2%-2.5% range in 2025-2026. 10 Year Treasury Yield From the rise to record levels in the equity markets this week, it is clear that Wall Street was happy with the results of the presidential election. It is also plausible that had Kamala Harris won, the financial markets could have performed similarly. After all, during President Biden’s term in office, stocks are up 50%. Perhaps the rise in the equity markets was just relief that there was a clear winner and that there won’t be days, weeks, or even months of uncertainty and ballot recounts. Also note that three of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, AMZN, TSLA) also hit record highs this past week (ended November 8th). During President-elect Trump’s first term, the S&P 500 rose +67%. We presented a table that showed a comparison of significant economic indicators Then & Now. Given the much higher starting points in the Now column, especially the P/E ratio and the rising debt/GDP, a repeat of that 67% growth in the S&P 500 achieved in his first term appears to us to be much harder to achieve over the next four years. But, then again, who thought even a week ago that Mr. Trump would be re-elected so handily? Per market expectations, the Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points this past week. The tone of Fed Chair Powell’s press conference was on the dovish side, as the Fed sees inflation continuing to move to its 2% goal and whose attention is now focused on the labor market. Of interest was Powell’s response to a question regarding the +2.7% year/year PCE inflation rate. Powell’s response was that the six-month and three-month annualized rates were much lower. Quite the dovish response. We also now know that Mr. Powell will remain Chairman of the Fed at least through the end of his term (May ’26). Prior to the election, the Powell led Fed had already embarked on an easing cycle. That happened in September with the 50-basis point rate reduction. Given the duration of business cycles (measured in years), this Fed is unlikely to raise rates again during Powell’s remaining term. Meanwhile, the Leading Economic Indicators continue to forecast an economic slowdown (at a minimum), while the macroeconomic data coming from the government agencies mostly say that fairly robust economic growth will continue. We are of the belief that an economic slowdown is underway. We just don’t know yet if it will morph into a Recession. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) One Community.

Title: Elon Musk's wealth soars past $300 billion as Tesla shares climb on the back of Trump's election win

Elon Musk's net worth has surged past $300 billion as Tesla shares climbed following Trump's election win earlier this week. Musk's fortune stands at $314 billion as of Saturday, up a handsome $50 billion since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes Musk the only person with a current net worth of more than $300 billion — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos trails behind in second with $230 billion, while Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg rounds out the top three with $209 billion, per Bloomberg. The Tesla CEO's soaring wealth — which is shy of his record of around $340 billion in 2021 — follows a bumper week in the stock market for the company, which has seen its shares jump around 28% since Tuesday's close. The EV maker on Friday reached a trillion-dollar market valuation for the first time since April 2022. Musk was a big supporter of Trump during the latter's presidential campaign, putting over $100 million of his own money into a super PAC and holding his own rallies to try to get him elected. And it looks like that might be about to pay off for Musk. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note this week that Trump's win could significantly benefit Tesla, as the company is better positioned than competitors should Trump withdraw tax credits and other incentives meant to boost EV sales when he's back in office. "Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years," he said. Ives called Trump's victory a "homerun" for the company. Musk's other ventures, such as his aerospace company SpaceX, could also benefit during Trump's second term in office. Francesco Trebbi, a professor of business and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, previously told BI that a Trump presidency might help the company procure large contracts with the Department of Defense.

Title: Joe Biden's Illegal Migrant Inflow to Hit 9 Million by January
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/11/09/joe-bidens-illegal-migrant-inflow-hit-nine-million-january/

President Joe Biden’s border deputies will have admitted roughly nine million inadmissible migrants at the southern border by President Trump’s Inauguration Day, according to data quietly released just before the November 5 election. The agency data shows that Biden’s pro-migration chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, registered 10.5 million illegal migrants at the border from January 2021 to June 2024. Out of that total, he blocked only 2.5 million migrants under the Title 42 epidemic rules, which he lifted in mid-2023. He also “returned” home or “removed” just 1.9 million of the 10.5 million migrants. He then released almost 5.9 million migrants into the United States to take Americans’ housing, jobs, and school slots, the federal data states. Yearly repatriations by fiscal year The Cuban-born, pro-migration border chief also stood by as roughly 2.2 million additional “gotaway” migrants sneaked past the border wall. He refused to complete or sufficiently patrol the incomplete wall. From July to October, an additional 600,000 migrants arrived, and roughly 400,000 were allowed through the border. From early November to Trump’s Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, Mayorkas will have admitted another 300,000 migrants at current rates, with very little resistance from Biden’s deputies. That final flood will bring his inflow to almost nine million inadmissible southern migrants. But Mayorkas’s southern inflow was in addition to the massive legal inflow of roughly three million legal migrants. Biden also welcomed at least 1.5 million Indian and Chinese white-collar visa workers during Biden’s four years. The visa workers shrink Americans’ white-collar salaries, displace Americans from Fortune 500 careers and management, and allow C-Suite executives to disregard professionals‘ expertise in product innovation, service quality, technological security, and business reliability. So Mayorkas’s flood of roughly 15 million illegal, quasi-legal, legal, and temporary migrants adds up to roughly one new migrant for every American birth. His migrant wave was a massive giveaway to investors, who gained roughly $20 in the stock market for every $1 in profit from the resulting lower wages, additional purchases, and higher rents. The profits help to fund an Astroturf Empire of advocacy groups that keep editors from following the money in migration. But his tsunami also washed away Americans’ wages and salaries before they voted in the November election. “Revised labor productivity and cost data now show real (inflation-adjusted) compensation fell 0.2% last year,” a November 7 tweet from economist E.J. Antoni said. “Since ’20, real hourly compensation is down a cumulative 4.2% through ’23 – it’s no wonder why people are mad,” he added: The Biden administration built its economic strategy on Mayorkas’s migrants. For example, the migrants filled many new jobs at lower wages, helping to reduce some forms of inflation as Congress spent hundreds of billions of dollars on Biden’s Bidennomics priorities. However, the flood of migrants also inflated housing costs, leaving huge numbers of younger Americans poorer in 2023 than in 2019. For example, the Cato Institute admitted that Biden’s migrants into Springfield, Ohio, inflated the cost of housing by roughly $75,000 per house. Unsurprisingly, Trump gained a record share of votes in Springfield. Mayorkas’s flood of cheap labor also minimized the incentive for CEOs to raise the productivity of their blue-collar workers. When labor is in short supply, CEOs invest in workplace productivity to help their workers get more done each day. The technology includes “pick and place” robots, automated metal-cutting, and dairy robots, and it allows higher wages, community prosperity, and happy voters. But when labor is plentiful, CEOs can boost short-term profits by cutting investment in favor of hiring disposable, low-wage workers. The Biden-era damage to U.S. productivity has been ignored by the establishment media, but it was marked on November 7, when federal data show that labor productivity grew by less than one percent — or just 0.7 percent per year during Biden’s four years in office. Before Biden’s Extraction Migration strategy, productivity grew at 2.9 percent per year from 1994 to 2004 as U.S. companies began using desktop computers in a wide variety of jobs: Productivity actually fell in 2022 as the desperate and cheap migrant labor flooded into jobs once held by experienced and better-paid American employees. They also flooded into the jobs that could have employed the several million Americans who have fallen out of the workforce as too old, unhealthy, or alienated for busy employers to hire and train. The economic trauma of Biden’s wealth-shifting migration deeply damaged Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign and public support for the 1950s’ “Nation of Immigrants” narrative. It also put Trump and his allies back in power: Once Mayorkas is removed from office and his policies are reversed, the simultaneous rise in wages and loss of migrants will force companies to buy the productivity machinery being developed and built by Americans. For example, Grist.org reported on October 8: Detasseling corn used to be a rite of passage in the Midwest. Teenagers would wade through seas of corn, removing tassels — the bit that looks like a yellow feather duster at the top of each stalk — to prevent unwanted pollination. Extreme heat, drought, and intense rainfall have made this labor-intensive task even harder. And it’s now more often done by migrant farmworkers who sometimes put in 20-hour days to keep up. That’s why Jason Cope, co-founder of farm tech company PowerPollen, thinks it’s essential to mechanize arduous tasks like detasseling. His team created a tool a tractor can use to collect the pollen from male plants without having to remove the tassel. It can then be saved for future crops. “We can account for climate change by timing pollen perfectly as it’s delivered,” he said. “And it takes a lot of that labor that’s hard to come by out of the equation.” “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued [emphasis added]: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. When Mayorkas is gone, he will also have left a massive political bomb under the Democrats’ foundational claim to be the noble champions of underdogs, refugees, migrant children, and separated families. Mayorkas’s colonialism-adjacent economic strategy of Extraction Migration has expanded child labor in the United States, traded remittances to dictatorships in exchange for millions of workers, and accelerated the Mexican corruption that helps the cartels smuggle deadly drugs into American communities. His policy drained vital young workers from developing countries for use by Wall Street investors, separated millions of adult migrants from their left-behind wives and children, and helped kill many thousands of migrants in distant jungles, boats, snowstorms, and rivers. “There were two images of his treacherous journey north that he couldn’t get out of his head,” reporter Albinson Linares from Telemundo.com said in 2023 about a Venezuelan migrant named Johan Torres: The first was how a [migrant] person who resisted a robbery in Mexico was killed with a machete; the other happened in the [Panama] jungle, when he saw a man leave behind his young daughter, waist-deep in mud. “He left her there, lying in the mud and crying, and I couldn’t do anything because I was dying of exhaustion. But I can’t forget that,” he said with tears in his eyes. “Failure has many fathers, but Mayorkas is the first among equals,” Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News.

Title: What’s next for nuclear stocks after regulatory pushback?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-next-for-nuclear-stocks-after-regulatory-pushback-160027265.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nuclear energy stocks have become a favorite of Wall Street this year as the artificial intelligence boom spreads and Big Tech searches for ways to meet its growing power demand. They helped power the S&P 500’s Utilities index (XLU) to all-time highs — the index is on track to outperform the S&P 500's equal-weighted counterpart (^SPXEW) in 7 of the past 10 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And Vistra (VST), a nuclear power company, recently surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year to date. Big Tech firms, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), drove the gains, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in nuclear power names over the course of several weeks. It’s a story the market ran with. Then came a regulatory wrist slap that briefly stopped the nuclear energy rally in its tracks. In a 2-to-1 ruling on Nov. 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a request from Talen Energy (TLN) to increase the power it could provide Amazon from its Susquehanna power plant, citing concerns about grid reliability and energy affordability. Several nuclear energy stocks, including Talen, Oklo (OKLO), Centrus Energy (LEU), Vistra (VST), and NuScale Power (SMR), tumbled the following Monday. Amazon is expected to petition the decision, according to CFRA analyst Daniel Rich. But for investors, “it certainly is a setback,” Rich said. Rich explained that co-location agreements have become a major focus for the tech industry, as they allow hyperscalers to buy power directly from an existing energy source for their data centers. This enables them to build more data centers at speed and at lower costs. But these agreements may be a sticking point for regulators, which is why Big Tech has pursued other strategies, such as creating new sources of nuclear energy through small modular reactors (SMRs). Though there are currently no SMRs in the United States, companies like Amazon see them as a way to affordably add to the power grid while also meeting the increased energy demands AI requires. "The order may not represent a long-term risk," ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance. "It’s more that FERC may have punted or didn’t want to set a precedent about co-location until it had firm policy." Clay Sell, the CEO of nuclear reactor designer X-energy, told Yahoo Finance that “a significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the US for the next 25 years is going to come from AI.” “It could be as high as 10%, 20%,” Sell added. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk also recently contextualized the amount of power the AI boom is going to require. His data shows that you’d have to add three New York Cities' worth of power to the grid by 2030 to meet the demand that is going to come from artificial intelligence. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) Tech companies see nuclear as a way to meet that demand. That may be one reason why Amazon is not done with co-location, telling Yahoo Finance via email that “we remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives.” Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez also rebuffed regulators on his company's earnings call, which came one day after the ruling, saying, "Co-location in competitive markets remains one of the best ways for the US to quickly build the large data centers that are necessary to lead on AI." Despite beating on earnings and revenue, Constellation stock (CEG) fell after the company reported third quarter results due to fallout from the Talen news. But CFRA's Rich said Constellation is a stock to watch in nuclear. “I think Constellation is the most buyable dip," he said. "Constellation … is by far and away the largest nuclear operator, more than three times more megawatt capacity than the next competitor. And we think that in our view, nuclear is really one of the best ways to service this type of demand from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, [and Magnificent Seven] names that have large needs for power.” Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Monumental Milestone: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Is Now Bigger Than Its Gold ETF Just Months After Launch

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched less than a year ago and have already been dubbed the most successful ETF launches in history. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), just smashed another record. To be more precise, IBIT has now overtaken the asset manager’s iShares Gold ETF (IAU) in terms of assets under management — a huge milestone given that the former investment vehicle only started trading in mid-January this year. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds more assets than the Wall Street behemoth’s gold ETF despite only launching 10 months ago. The iShares Gold ETF debuted in January 2005 and has since accumulated 32.96 billion in net assets. For comparison, the IBIT has amassed an impressive $33.17 billion in assets — a milestone the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, called “absolutely wild.” Bitcoin and gold are often considered comparable safe-haven assets, with most crypto industry pundits long treating BTC as “digital gold.” BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s bullish strength was arguably boosted by Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. During his campaign, Trump loudly supported the crypto sector. The company’s Bitcoin fund registered its highest-ever trading volume of $4.1 billion on the day Trump won the presidency. As ZyCrypto covered, the trading activity even surpassed the daily volume posted by blue chip stocks like Netflix, Berkshire Hathaway, and Visa during the same timeframe — a sign of excitement among investors that the president-elect will keep all his many promises to nurture the crypto industry, replace unpopular regulators and allow crypto entrepreneurs to introduce products without fear of lawsuits or Wells Notices from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Data from Farside reveals that IBIT has clocked more than $27 billion in net inflows since its debut, with a record-breaking $1.1 billion in new investor money flowing into the ETF on Thursday, an extraordinary demonstration of demand for the spot BTC product. Meanwhile, commentators believe Trump’s victory will open the door for over a half dozen proposed cryptocurrency ETFs waiting on approval from U.S. regulators. After the Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals, asset managers have submitted a slew of regulatory filings to list ETFs holding altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Litecoin (LTC).

Tesla shares spiked in the wake of Donald Trump’s election win this week–and so did a handful of other stocks, in industries ranging from crypto to coffee. Elon Musk is worth more than $300 billion for the first time in more than two years. It was a giddy week for U.S. stocks. Markets jumped in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential election win early Wednesday, briefly sending the S&P 500 over 6,000 for the first time ever on Friday. The Nasdaq index rose 5.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly as much. No billionaire’s fortune grew more in dollar terms than that of Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and principal owner of social media firm X. Tesla shares rose nearly 30% in the past week, increasing the company’s market value to more than $1 trillion, adding $41 billion to Musk’s net worth and lifting him above the $300 billion mark for the first time in two years. Musk ended Friday worth $304 billion, Forbes estimates. In addition to a runup in the price of Bitcoin–as of late Friday afternoon it was trading at $76,550, just off its all-time high–shares of crypto exchange Coinbase Global and crypto-friendly stock trading app Robinhood shined this week. Coinbase shares rocketed up 48% this week, boosting the fortunes of cofounders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, while Robinhood shares shot up 27%, lifting the net worths of cofounders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. Big tech stocks ticked up as well. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison got nearly $24 billion richer this week as shares of the software and cloud computing company he cofounded rose 11%. Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckeberg got $9 billion and about $7.5 billion richer, respectively, as shares of both their companies moved higher. It’s not just election enthusiasm driving up share prices. A few companies that reported strong quarterly earnings in the second half of the week had enormous runups. Nasdaq-listed AppLovin, which makes tools that help developers grow their apps, reported better-than-expected third quarter revenue and Ebitda late Wednesday, leading shares to jump on Thursday and continue rising Friday–a 77% rise for the week. That boosted CEO and cofounder Adam Foroughi’s fortune by some $3.8 billion to $8.7 billion. Doximity, a social network for doctors, had a “blowout quarter” per a report from analysts at Canaccord Genuity. Shares of the Nasdaq-listed company rocketed up nearly 38% this week, adding nearly $900 million to cofounder and CEO Jeff Tangney’s fortune. Coffee drink chain Dutch Bros also had reason to cheer. Shares of the Oregon-based company got a 41% boost this week. The company projects higher revenue for the year. Billionaire CEO Travis Boersma’s fortune got a $900 million lift. Here are some of the biggest billionaire gainers of the past week. (Net worths are as of market close Friday, November 8. Change is measured from market close on Friday, November 1.) Elon Musk Net worth: $304 billion Gain: $41 billion Musk, who formerly supported Democrats, donated nearly $119 million to a super PAC supporting Trump, showed up at Trump rallies and has vowed to cut $2 trillion from the U.S. budget as an advisor to the new president. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients after the election results came out that Tesla has several potential avenues from which it would benefit under Trump’s leadership, including a possible elimination of a federal tax credit on electric vehicles, which would make it harder for Tesla’s smaller competitors. Larry Ellison Net worth: $230.7 billion Gain: $23.7 billion Software and cloud computing firm Oracle, which Ellison cofounded and chairs, got a boost along with other big tech stocks in the wake of Trump’s win. Shares scooted up 11% for the week. Brian Armstrong Net worth: $11.7 billion Gain: $3.7 billion Fred Ehrsam Net worth: $3.3 billion Gain: $700 million Armstrong, who is CEO and chairman of crypto exchange Coinbase Global, cofounded the firm with Ehrsam, now a board member. Expectations of a crypto-welcoming Trump administration drove shares up markedly on Wednesday, November 6–a rally that extended on Thursday and Friday, as Bitcoin hit a new high, climbing just past $76,000. Vlad Tenev Net worth: $1.9 billion Gain: $400 million Baiju Bhatt Net worth: $2 billion Gain: $400 million Robinhood Networks, the pro-crypto trading app founded by Tenev and Bhatt, also rode the Bitcoin wave higher, with shares climbing 27% this past week. Tenev serves as CEO of the company; Bhatt stepped down from an executive role at Robinhood in March and has since founded a startup that plans to set up solar panels in space that will beam renewable energy back to earth. Jeff Tangney Net worth: $3.2 billion Gain: $900 million Doximity, the social network for doctors that Tangney cofounded and runs as CEO, reported better than expected quarterly earnings on Thursday after the market closed.

Kathleen Watkins at the InterContinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Photo by Steve Humphreys The funeral details for broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, have been announced following her death on Thursday at the age of 90. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. Ms Watkins’ funeral service will depart from Howth at 11am on Tuesday, arriving for Requiem Mass at 12pm at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, followed by a private burial. Her funeral notice said she died “peacefully on in the wonderful care of the team at the Blackrock Clinic”. "Beloved wife and best friend of the late Gay Byrne, loving mother to Crona and Suzy, adored Nana Kit to Cian, Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry, mother-in-law to Philip and Ronan and sister of Clare, Phil and the late Jim. Sadly missed by her family, relatives and a wide circle of treasured friends,” the notice read. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio last week that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. Tributes poured in for Ms Watkins from across the world of politics, media and beyond following the news of her death. President Michael D Higgins said it was with “great sorrow” that he and his wife Sabina learned of her passing. "We were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Jim Cramer Says Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Is ‘One Of The World’s Greatest Bargains’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day’s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency. He pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks Cramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said: “I want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who’s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they’re beneath notice or they’re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.” He also raised an important question for the viewers: “If you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?” According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don’t get enough attention. “In the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103 Cramer called Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) a great bargain and remarked that it will not take a hit in the coming days. “Netflix is one of the world's greatest bargains, and because they make programming for all sides of the aisle, you know that it's not gonna get hammered by whoever comes out ahead tonight or this week or next month, whatever. There's no percentage in going after Netflix.” Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a leading provider of entertainment services, offering a vast variety of streaming content to millions of subscribers around the world. In October, the company reported its financial results for the third quarter, showing a 15% increase in revenue compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was accompanied by the addition of over 5 million new subscribers. Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) Chief Financial Officer, highlighted that there are still "hundreds of millions of households that aren't members," suggesting significant untapped potential for future growth. A key factor driving this expansion has been its advertising-supported subscription tier. Management indicated that the membership for the ad-supported plan grew by 35% year-over-year in the third quarter, though there were some challenges. The company is projecting total revenue for the full year 2024 to exceed $38 billion. Its management also provided guidance for 2025, anticipating revenue to reach between $43 billion and $44 billion, which would represent an approximately 11% year-over-year increase. Overall NFLX ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Cava (CAVA) might move higher on growing optimism about its earnings prospects, which is reflected by its upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While there are strong investment cases for each of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, I see one as the clear winner for long-term investors. Billionaire Bill Ackman said on Friday he would seek to delist investment firm Pershing Square Holdings and move record label Universal Music Group away from Amsterdam, following attacks on Israeli soccer fans. In a statement on X, Ackman said Pershing Square's board had already been considering the move and "events in Amsterdam during the last 24 hours provide an appropriate tipping point" to follow through. In the attacks, supporters of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv were targeted after a match, by what Amsterdam's mayor described as "antisemitic hit and run squads". Lantronix (LTRX) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of -33.33% and 7.22%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 2024. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock?

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other trending AI stocks. The extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. This number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report. The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.

On November 6, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini lowered the price target on the stock to $15 from $32.50 and kept a Negative rating on the shares. The advisory updated estimates based on the preliminary results and the guide. In an investor note, the advisory noted that despite a lack of a detailed financial statement and inability to file with the SEC, the updated estimates should still help investors with margin trends, the company's earnings direction, and the implied downside risk to consensus. Overall SMCI ranks 9th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) set a new record for inflows, reaching $1.12 billion, topping its previous record of $872 million. The new record was noted on SoSoValue and comes when Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $76,677 across major exchanges on November 7. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin broke a new all-time high of $75,317 as voting results signalled a Donald Trump win for the White House. BlackRock’s IBIT net assets now account for $34.29 billion, significantly pushing it ahead of its competitors. In October, BlackRock set a new record when its total assets reached $30 billion in 293 days. Dary McGovern, COO of Bitcoin native Xapo Bank, said to CoinJournal that Bitcoin’s new record suggests a “broader shift in institutional confidence, with notable market movements such as BlackRock’s record net inflows into its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT),” adding: “The growing institutional interest underscores Bitcoin’s increasing recognition as a trusted asset class, driven by rising global demand and mainstream adoption. As more investors seek exposure to digital assets, Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation becomes ever clearer.” The 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily total net inflow of $1.38 billion, also a new record since listing in January. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted BlackRock’s new record in a post on X, saying: “Even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any BTC ETF ever.” Told y’all it was prob gonna be big, altho even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any btc etf ever. https://t.co/Q5MPDMrTYv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 Balchunas later added that the spot Bitcoin ETFs have taken in a combined $6.7 billion in the past month and $25.5 billion year to date, and are 93% of the way to passing Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million Bitcoin. HOOVER CITY: Bitcoin ETFs took in a record-smashing $1.4b yesterday (the Trump effect). $IBIT alone was +$1.1b. That's +$6.7b in past mo and $25.5b YTD. All told they feasted on about 18k btc in one day (vs 450 mined) and are now 93% of the way to passing Satoshi's 1.1mil btc. pic.twitter.com/dNLoENlDB3 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 “This confidence suggests that Bitcoin is now seen as a legitimate hedge and growth asset, particularly appealing amid traditional market uncertainties and as regulatory clarity improves,” said James Toledano, COO at Unity, a self-custody crypto wallet, to CoinJournal. “Just look at pension funds in both the UK and US investing in Bitcoin too. Sentiment has changed massively in such a short space of time.” Grayscale’s GBTC, the second-largest by net assets at $16.80 billion, saw a net inflow of $7.31 million. Fidelity’s FBTC reported $190.92 million and Ark and 21Shares saw $17.61 million.

November 08, 2024 17:34 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) TORONTO, Nov. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK) today announced that it has called a special meeting of unitholders (the “Meeting”) of the iShares Premium Money Market ETF (the “iShares Fund”), to be held on or about January 22, 2025 to approve a change to the investment objective of the iShares Fund to permit investments in asset-backed commercial paper (the “Proposal”). BlackRock Canada is holding the Meeting solely as a virtual (online) meeting by way of live audio webcast. The proposed change to the iShares Fund investment objective is as follows: Following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate in June 2024, the bankers’ acceptance (“BA”) based lending model has largely been discontinued in Canada. The discontinuation of BAs has materially reduced the iShares Fund’s access to credit exposure, which is an important source of yield. BlackRock Canada believes that Canadian dollar denominated asset-backed commercial paper is an appropriate investment opportunity for the iShares Fund in order to continue accessing investment-grade, short-term Canadian dollar credit instruments. Credit exposure is an important tool for maximizing income while maintaining liquidity. The asset-backed commercial paper market in Canada is limited to bank-sponsored issuers and has undergone significant reform since the 2007/2008 financial crisis, resulting in enhanced investor protections. The market has continued to grow in response to the discontinuation of BAs and bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper is one of the primary instruments used by Canadian money market funds to obtain credit exposure. In accordance with applicable securities laws, a joint management information circular relating to the Proposal (the “Circular”) will be made available to unitholders in advance of the Meeting. Notice of the Meeting and information outlining the procedures for accessing the Circular online (or requesting a copy thereof) will be mailed on or about December 20, 2024. Unitholders of record of the iShares Fund at the close of business on December 5, 2024, will be entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting. The Circular will also be made available on www.sedarplus.ca and www.blackrock.com/ca and will include additional details regarding the Proposal. BlackRock Canada believes that the proposed investment objective change is in the best interests of the iShares Fund. If the change to the investment objective is approved by unitholders of the iShares Fund, BlackRock Canada expects that the Proposal will be effective as of January 31, 2025. Implementation of the Proposal is subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Title: Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Market Cap—Musk Becomes $300 Billion Man After Trump Win

Friends Read Free Shares of Tesla Motors rallied 9 percent to end the trading week, pushing the company’s value to $1 trillion for the first time since April 2022. The electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock reached $325 on the Nasdaq Composite Index during the Nov. 8 trading session. Before Election Day, Tesla maintained a market cap of about $807 billion, and shares were up just 1 percent for the year. The company rejoins the growing club of trillion-dollar companies, including Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Tesla first ventured past the $1 trillion threshold in October 2021. Because of the stock’s significant gains, Elon Musk’s net worth surged to $300 billion for the first time in more than two years. Tesla’s stock rocketed by 33 percent this week, adding about $200 billion in value as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. Since billionaire Elon Musk was a critical ally for Trump during the 2024 campaign, traders are betting that a second term for the Republican could benefit the automaker. Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC received about $118 million from the billionaire. Musk appeared alongside the president-elect at several rallies in the final days of the presidential election, hosted a tour across the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, and was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on election night. Trump has provided mixed views on electric automobiles. “I’m for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in August at a rally in Atlanta. Trump later revealed that he may consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. In March, Trump stated that the U.S. automotive industry could suffer a “bloodbath” partly because of the current administration’s green energy policies. President Joe Biden’s administration has introduced EV incentives and EV-related grants to accelerate the transition from gas-powered automobiles to new energy vehicles. Still, Tesla could benefit under a Trump administration and provide the company with a competitive advantage, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled with likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players,” Ives said in a note. Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Research, said that any changes to EV subsidies could affect domestic sales of electric cars. The stock has trended upward in the second half following a lackluster first half. Shares soared last month after the company’s upbeat third-quarter earnings report. Tesla topped Wall Street forecasts in the third quarter and registered better-than-expected profits. In the earnings call, Musk said that his “best guess” is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 percent in 2025 amid “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Musk also said that he would help speed up the federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. Bank of America raised its target to “Buy” and forecasts a 17-percent upside to $350 from the previous estimate of $265. The first half of 2024, Goldstein said, was “likely the bottom” for the company. “In our view, the results signal that the first half of 2024 was likely the bottom for Tesla’s automotive gross profits, as we expect fourth-quarter results will also exceed 20 [percent],” Goldstein said in an Oct. 24 note.

Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of just over $77,000 on Friday, continuing its record-breaking streak following Donald Trump’s reelection as President of the United States. The strong support from the crypto community for Trump’s return to the White House is fueling Bitcoin’s upward momentum, making its rise appear unstoppable as of now. The leading cryptocurrency hit a record high of $77,239 at approximately 3:00 PM on Friday. According to crypto tracking website CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency has surged 113,011% since 2013. This means a $1000 investment in Bitcoin back then would now be worth over $1 million. Bitcoin’s price is expected to rise further, showing heightened optimism and enthusiasm among investors due to recent political developments. The momentum shows no signs of slowing — among seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Some even anticipate when the top cryptocurrency will cross the $100,000 level. Following Trump’s reelection, investors are pouring funds into the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds). On November 7th alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK+0.27%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with over $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time high has lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across various digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, hovered around $2,900, while Cardano reached $0.44—marking an impressive 10% increase in the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Chainlink and Polygon, also surged by over 7% and 13%, respectively. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The next monthly inflation read is scheduled for Wednesday before the market open. Economist expect the Consumer Price Index to have risen 2.6% on an annualized basis in September, with a rise of 0.2% from the prior month. Next week Wall Street will hear from more companies as they announce their quarterly results, including Live Nation (LYV), Spotify (SPOT), Home Depot (HD), and Hertz (HTZ). On Monday, Nov. 11, the stock market will be open but the bond market will be closed in observance of Veterans Day.

AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), now a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, briefly touched a new high earlier in the session but later slipped below the flatline. Other notable movers touching all-time highs include the S&P 500's Industrials Sector ETF (XLI) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks. Tesla's (TSLA) market cap rose above $1 trillion on Friday after shares of the EV maker touched 52-week highs.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched 6,000 for the first time ever on Friday as stocks head toward their best week in a year. The broad market index jumped more than 0.4% to new record highs after a monster rally this week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win. The move higher also follows the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed to new highs on Friday, surpassing the 44,000 level for the first time ever. Chip stocks initially soared on former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s win and the Fed’s latest rate cut. But they moved into the red Friday as analysts begin to contemplate uncertainty surrounding Trump’s approach to the chip sector as he returns to the White House in January. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell more than 1%, dragging the Nasdaq (^IXIC). Nvidia (NVDA) dropped 1.1%, Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 1.4%, Arm (ARM) sank 3.5% while AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron (MU) fell less than 1%. "Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding. The industry is broadly braced for another round of restrictions on the supply of chips and equipment to China,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts wrote Friday. "Trump's win was clearly the key event this week, and many semiconductor stocks, esp semicaps, are likely to trade sideways till there is clarity on further restrictions, tariffs, and Chips Act funding," Jefferies said. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $76,000 on Friday as the risk-on rally post Donald Trump's White House win was on pace to end the week on a high note. The cryptocurrency spiked to new highs on Wednesday following the presidential election results. Trump was a supporter of bitcoin during his campaign, advocating for the creation of a national crypto stockpile if elected to the White House. Chinese stocks fell on Friday, dragging on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which hovered near the flatline. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus sent shares of Chinese tech stocks lower. The recently announced $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur the economy. E-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (BABA) fell nearly 6% while PDD Holdings (PDD) also dropped 6%. Earlier this week the sector fell over concerns of potential tariffs after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Airbnb (ABNB) shares fell nearly 10% Friday after posting mixed third quarter results. Quarterly earnings per share of $2.13 missed Wall Street’s forecast of $2.15, and revenue of $3.73 billion came in ahead of the $3.72 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post maintained his Neutral rating on the stock, raising his near-term estimates for bookings over the next year but lowering his 2025 earnings growth outlook. “While Airbnb is expanding its geographic reach, and has a number of new growth initiatives to help to capitalize on its large bookings ecosystem, core nights growth is in line with peers and the margin growth seems less likely in 2025,” Post said. He expects shares to rise to $154 over the next 12 months. The stock stood at roughly $133 Friday morning. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth also has a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hitting $142 over the next year. Anmuth said in a note to investors Friday morning “Overall, we are encouraged by improving demand trends & ABNB’s early progress toward expanding beyond the core, but expect growth sustainability to remain the biggest pushback.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) soared to new intraday highs on Friday, crossing the 44,000 level. The blue-chip index was up nearly 0.7%, or about 290 points. Ironically, AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), which joined the Dow on Friday, was lower by about 1% during the session. The major average is up about 28% year to date. Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap on Friday as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared as much as 7%. The stock has been on fire this week following Donald Trump's White House victory. CEO Elon Musk bet big on Trump, with more than $130 million in political support. The question for investors is whether the financial commitments will benefit Tesla. On Friday, Tesla shares were trading at their highest level since March 22. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 10% and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $30 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.5 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $3.9 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day prior as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. But with Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is down just 2% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 60% in the past month. Read more here. Americans are feeling increasingly better about the short-term path for inflation. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed consumers expect inflation to sit at 2.6% in a year, a decrease from last month's expectation of 2.7%. November's reading is the lowest since December 2020 and is within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation did tick higher, though, rising to 3.1% from 3% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 73, up from 71 in October. Interviews for the survey concluded on Monday and therefore don't capture any reactions to election results.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. And on Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year to date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as a component of the major average.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks capped their best week of the year on Friday after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly hit 6,000 in a market rally spurred by Donald Trump's White House victory followed by the Federal Reserve's latest rate cut. The broad-based index rose 0.4% to a new record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6% after crossing 44,000 for the first time during the session. Stocks edged higher to end a stellar week of gains driven by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's policies will boost the economy. The initial "Trump trade" rush was volatile on Friday as the US dollar (DX=F) and Treasury yields gave up a good chunk of their post-election gains. Even so, Wall Street major gauges notched fresh milestones during the session after racking up more records on Thursday as the Federal Reserve delivered the expected interest rate cut. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus drew investor attention, putting pressure on Chinese stocks and oil prices. The $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur a faltering economy. In equities, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) officially entered the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared more than 9%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped more than 10% after Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of his social media platform, Truth Social. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks capped their best week in a year on Friday as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched the 6,000 mark and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) crossed 44,000 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed just above the flat line. Friday's gains were a continuation of the monster rally this week spurred by Donald Trump's White House win on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) held above $76,000 ,while Tesla (TSLA) shares rose roughly 8% on Friday to extend gains of 30% for the week. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 15% as Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. After a week of market highs on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win, investors can look forward to more economic data next week for clues on the health of the economy. The next monthly inflation read is scheduled for Wednesday before the market open. Economist expect the Consumer Price Index to have risen 2.6% on an annualized basis in September, with a rise of 0.2% from the prior month. Next week Wall Street will hear from more companies as they announce their quarterly results, including Live Nation (LYV), Spotify (SPOT), Home Depot (HD), and Hertz (HTZ). On Monday, Nov. 11, the stock market will be open but the bond market will be closed in observance of Veterans Day. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed out of negative territory to hit new intraday highs along with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Utilities (XLU) led the market gains along with Real Estate (XLRE) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) as Tesla (TSLA) shares gained more than 9% during the session. Tesla (TSLA) shares rose to a session high of 9% on Friday to hover near $325 each. The EV maker's market cap also climbed above $1 trillion. Tesla stock has soared more than 30% over the past week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory as the company's CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump's biggest supporters. Tesla shares have rallied more than 30% in the past week. Stocks were on track for their best weekly gain this year as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hit the 6,000 mark on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) crossed 44,000 on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win earlier this week, followed by Federal Reserve's latest rate cut. On Friday the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) wavered between positive and negative territory but if the tech-heavy index manages to close above the flatline, it will notch another record close. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), now a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, briefly touched a new high earlier in the session but later slipped below the flatline. Other notable movers touching all-time highs include the S&P 500's Industrials Sector ETF (XLI) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks. Tesla's (TSLA) market cap rose above $1 trillion on Friday after shares of the EV maker touched 52-week highs. The stock has soared 30% over the past week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched 6,000 for the first time ever on Friday as stocks head toward their best week in a year. The broad market index jumped more than 0.4% to new record highs after a monster rally this week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win. The move higher also follows the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed to new highs on Friday, surpassing the 44,000 level for the first time ever. Chip stocks initially soared on former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s win and the Fed’s latest rate cut. But they moved into the red Friday as analysts begin to contemplate uncertainty surrounding Trump’s approach to the chip sector as he returns to the White House in January. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell more than 1%, dragging the Nasdaq (^IXIC). Nvidia (NVDA) dropped 1.1%, Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 1.4%, Arm (ARM) sank 3.5% while AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron (MU) fell less than 1%. "Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding. The industry is broadly braced for another round of restrictions on the supply of chips and equipment to China,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts wrote Friday. "Trump's win was clearly the key event this week, and many semiconductor stocks, esp semicaps, are likely to trade sideways till there is clarity on further restrictions, tariffs, and Chips Act funding," Jefferies said. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $76,000 on Friday as the risk-on rally post Donald Trump's White House win was on pace to end the week on a high note. The cryptocurrency spiked to new highs on Wednesday following the presidential election results. Trump was a supporter of bitcoin during his campaign, advocating for the creation of a national crypto stockpile if elected to the White House. Chinese stocks fell on Friday, dragging on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which hovered near the flatline. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus sent shares of Chinese tech stocks lower. The recently announced $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur the economy. E-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (BABA) fell nearly 6% while PDD Holdings (PDD) also dropped 6%. Earlier this week the sector fell over concerns of potential tariffs after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Airbnb (ABNB) shares fell nearly 10% Friday after posting mixed third quarter results. Quarterly earnings per share of $2.13 missed Wall Street’s forecast of $2.15, and revenue of $3.73 billion came in ahead of the $3.72 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post maintained his Neutral rating on the stock, raising his near-term estimates for bookings over the next year but lowering his 2025 earnings growth outlook. “While Airbnb is expanding its geographic reach, and has a number of new growth initiatives to help to capitalize on its large bookings ecosystem, core nights growth is in line with peers and the margin growth seems less likely in 2025,” Post said. He expects shares to rise to $154 over the next 12 months. The stock stood at roughly $133 Friday morning. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth also has a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hitting $142 over the next year. Anmuth said in a note to investors Friday morning “Overall, we are encouraged by improving demand trends & ABNB’s early progress toward expanding beyond the core, but expect growth sustainability to remain the biggest pushback.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) soared to new intraday highs on Friday, crossing the 44,000 level. The blue-chip index was up nearly 0.7%, or about 290 points. Ironically, AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), which joined the Dow on Friday, was lower by about 1% during the session. The major average is up about 28% year to date. Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap on Friday as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared as much as 7%. The stock has been on fire this week following Donald Trump's White House victory. CEO Elon Musk bet big on Trump, with more than $130 million in political support. The question for investors is whether the financial commitments will benefit Tesla. On Friday, Tesla shares were trading at their highest level since March 22. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 10% and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $30 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.5 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $3.9 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day prior as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. But with Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is down just 2% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 60% in the past month. Read more here. Americans are feeling increasingly better about the short-term path for inflation. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed consumers expect inflation to sit at 2.6% in a year, a decrease from last month's expectation of 2.7%. November's reading is the lowest since December 2020 and is within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation did tick higher, though, rising to 3.1% from 3% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 73, up from 71 in October. Interviews for the survey concluded on Monday and therefore don't capture any reactions to election results. US stocks flirted with their record highs on Friday following the latest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve. Market euphoria following a Trump White House victory seemed to drift as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. And on Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year to date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as a component of the major average.

The "Badlans was slightly better, but still changed like a commercial with game-play... And no song... "Whizbang" have the same "commercial type" (&level) cinematic......The latest "The Great Dark Beyond"... (inhale, exhale, inhale...) Like even Warcraft Rumble had cool cinematic - no song, but at least cinematic as it's own had "magic" & "creative" feeling - but this, the latest, was just awful, pushing even there these "influencers"(?), making it cringe like "Warcraft Rumble developer overview clip"...

Well - for me they have only one chance to redeem themselves, or at least give me some hope - if they will release for this upcoming anniversary "Full versions" of past cinematic songs (you know - typical stanza, refrain, stanza.

Very "thrifty" on their rewards... 30 years boiled down to 2 packs, lol And the recent expansion release granted something like 6 packs from twitch drops lol? This is definitely a head scratcher. I think the reason is that you only need to watch for 20 minutes for these drops, whereas for the recent expansion’s drops, you had to watch for 2 hours to receive two expansion packs. bruw ... for 30 years of franchise those reawrds are very poor, especially for HS...

Title: Donald Trump won the election. What happens to Trump Media now?
URL: https://qz.com/trump-media-stock-djt-president-election-1851691644
Time Published: 2024-11-08T20:11:26Z
Full Content:
When Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+15.04%) debuted on the Nasdaq (NDAQ+0.70%) in late March, Donald Trump had long since announced plans to launch his third bid for the White House. His election win now begs the question: What will happen to the company that counts the now president-elect as its biggest shareholder? Trump helped found Trump Media in 2021 with the launch his own social media platform, Truth Social, after being banned from X (META-0.41%) (formerly Twitter) in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. X owner and staunch Trump ally Elon Musk reinstated Trump’s X account in November 2022, one month after buying the platform. Trump Media went public on March 26 under the ticker DJT, after completing its merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) (DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Now that Trump will be returning to the White House in January, his more than 100 million shares are a focal point. In a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said that rumors allegedly coming from “market manipulators or short sellers” suggesting that he’s considering selling his stake in the company are “fake, untrue, and probably illegal.” “Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it,” he said. Although he stands to gain from a sale, it would be difficult to carry out without tanking the value of the stock. Earlier this year, Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes repeatedly called on Congress to investigate manipulation and illegal short-selling of DJT stock. From an ethics standpoint, it’s a little muddy. While Trump, who is the primary shareholder of Trump Media with a 57.6% stake in the company, can legally hold onto his shares while in office, there is a conflict of interest. As president, Trump has direct oversight of government agencies that oversee the company, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “It’s a clear conflict of interest for the president of the United States to perform those executive functions while owning a substantial stake in a media company, whether it’s social media or any other,” Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, told Straight Arrow News. In practice, however, vice president of research at Morningstar (MORN+1.54%) John Rekenthaler said in an interview that he doesn’t think it will be an issue. “I don’t think with his presidency that voters or federal, national legislators will pursue that,” he said. The symbiotic relationship between Trump and Trump Media raises red flags for investors. The company itself has acknowledged in regulatory filings that its success depends in part on Trump’s popularity and reputation. In the six weeks leading up to Election Day, “pre-election euphoria” drove the stock nearly 200% higher as Trump’s odds of winning increased. Even before the election, DJT was what Rekenthaler calls an “affinity stock,” trading on emotions and fanaticism for the president elect rather than on actual business performance. The company reported yet another quarterly loss in its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday — also Election Day. In the three months ended Sept. 30, Trump Media lost $19.2 million, with revenue falling 5.6% to just $1.01 million from a year earlier. Given his outsized stake in the company, DJT stock performance also drives much of Trump’s own wealth. As of Friday, the company had a market capitalization of $6.53 billion. At a price per share of around $32, Trump’s net worth stemming from his holdings in the company is in the ballpark of almost $4 billion. Shares have been especially volatile around the election, with the stock closing down nearly 23% Thursday before popping back up 18% in Friday afternoon trading. Rekenthaler said that it’s possible the pre-election rally was an election trade, rather than a long-term investment. That might explain some of the volatility in recent days, particularly the losses on the day after Trump’s election victory. “There is the adage that you sell on the good news,” Rekenthaler said. “Maybe some people sold on the good news after the election.” When it comes to what the stock will do once Trump returns to the Oval Office, it’s anybody’s guess, according to Rekenthaler. “No idea,” he said. “To the extent that I had an idea, that idea disappeared the day after the election.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ethereum price prediction – Will rising leverage drive or weaken ETH’s rally?

Time Published: 2024-11-08T20:00:33Z

In the last two days, Ethereum’s open interest has increased by more than $3 billion. Ethereum [ETH] has gained by 20% in just two days, with the price oscillating between $2,400 and $2,950. At press time, ETH traded at $2,922, its highest level in over three months. The recent gains have been accompanied by rising volatility. In fact, the estimated leverage ratio has spiked significantly this week to a seven-day high. At press time, this metric stood at 0.42. This shows that 42% of the open positions on the derivatives market are backed by leverage. A build-up of leverage activity tends to heighten price volatility. Source: CryptoQuant However, the estimated leverage ratio has yet to hit extreme levels, giving Ethereum room to continue with the uptrend. The newly opened positions on the derivatives market appear to be longs. This is seen in the rising funding rates to a three-month high. When funding rates are rising, it shows an influx of long positions. It also indicates that long traders are willing to pay a higher fee to maintain their positions, further suggesting that there is a bullish bias in the market. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, Ethereum’s open interest continues to rise, and at press time, it was at a five-month high of $16.61 billion per Coinglass data. In the last two days, Ethereum’s open interest has increased by more than $3 billion, further showing that speculative interest in ETH is high. The spike in trading activity and open positions in the derivatives market increases the likelihood of high volatility. It could also indicate that ETH could be on the verge of an overheated market. However, technical indicators suggest that an ETH bull run could also be underway. Ethereum is currently testing crucial resistance at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on its one-day chart. If ETH manages to flip this price level at $2,955, it could lead to a sustained uptrend. Flipping this resistance could also pave the way for a 12% rally to the 1.618 Fibonacci level ($3,260). Source: Tradingview The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests that more gains lie ahead. This metric has flipped positive and has also made a sharp move north, which shows that the uptrend is gaining strength. However, traders should watch out for signs of profit-taking as selling pressure could see the price drop to test support at $2,700. A drop below this support could usher in a downtrend. On 7th November, the total inflows to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $79.74 million, their highest level since August according to SoSoValue. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) ETF had the highest inflows of $28 million, followed by the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust with $23 million inflows. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The VanEck Ethereum Trust also recorded $12 million inflows marking its first inflows in two weeks. If the demand for ETH ETFs continues, it could bode well for Ethereum’s price.

Title: Is Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Empire in Trouble?
URL: https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/is-gwyneth-paltrows-goop-empire-in-trouble.php
Time Published: 2024-11-08T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | November 8, 2024 | For the past 16 years, Goop has been one of the shining lights in the celebrity business sphere. Gwyneth Paltrow’s woo-woo wellness company has endured a lot of jokes (and extremely legitimate criticism about its suspect claims and the people it supports), but it’s remained a major hit. In 2018, the New York Times reported that Goop was worth an estimated $250 million, thanks to its unusual wellness offerings like psychic vampire repellent and jade vagina eggs. Not bad for what started out as a newsletter by a bored actress. But now, reports are suggesting that Goop is stumbling. Last year, Goop opened a store in London, which closed quickly due to lack of interest. RadarOnline is claiming that closure led to around a $2 million loss for the company. Last week, Business Insider reported that Goop had undergone a second round of layoffs in only two months. In 2021, they also reported that 140 employees left the company in just two years. Among the issues cited were low salaries, poor leadership, and favoritism among the higher ranks. Yes, the pandemic shutdown didn’t help but the bleeding doesn’t seem to have stopped for Goop. Over the past month, things have gotten bad enough that The Times suggested that Goop is undergoing an entire business reshuffle just to stay afloat. Puck also got in on the act, reporting that, while Goop’s food vertical is doing well, the fashion and beauty parts are suffering. This is bad news given that they only recently launched a skincare line, available via Target. Puck wrote: Yikes. Puck then had sources saying that Paltrow seemed to have ‘disdain’ for some of the products she was selling, although Goop denied this in a statement. Goop has always been a strange and unique presence in the world of celebrity branding. It’s so specifically Gwyneth and so deliberately inaccessible to the biggest markets and demographics that it shouldn’t have worked. Yet it became the benchmark for the celeb business model for years, with many a copycat (hello, Blake Lively) and wannabes following in its bare footsteps. Goop was widely derided for questionable science and promotion of straight-up quackery but there is also a known and monied audience who love that crap. Paltrow was savvy in commodifying all of this faux-wellness nonsense and selling it to her fellow rich white ladies. She was also extremely good at monetising those rage clicks and playing along with her own parodic image, as evidenced by that vagina candle that sadly exploded from time to time. So, what changed? The wellness industry certainly hasn’t died; it’s only grown more powerful and intimidating since lockdown, and my Instagram feed is full of ‘self-care’ routines that are merely extended ads for a lot of Temu and Amazon crap. Rich lady companies are doing fine too, because that’s a demographic that stays rich regardless of the changing political tides. I don’t think it’s that we’re suddenly aware that Goop was peddling bullsh*t either. Sadly, snake oil and anti-pharma-driven rhetoric is extremely popular right now, and on all sides of the political spectrum. To me, it seems like Goop has never been a hugely reliable profit maker for Paltrow. She herself admitted that at a business summit with Forbes, saying, ‘Some years, we’ve doubled in growth. Some years, we are flat. Some years, we’re down, then we’re back up.’ She wasn’t a businesswoman who jumped into a gap in the market. She was an actress whose side-project became a thing and she went along with it. Plus, while there is a niche for what she sells, it’s not as wide as would be needed to sustain a multi-pronged, Fenty-esque empire. Selling your makeup line in Target at an affordable price is a good idea, but nobody expects Goop to be affordable or for the masses, least of all people who go to Target and know what they want. If you’re looking for a moisturizer and one of the celebs shilling it to you has a dodgy history with pseudoscience and also radiates ‘eat the poors,’ why would you buy it? Both skincare and clothing are crowded markets, even without the celeb brands in the mix. Where once everyone chased Gwyneth, now they all follow after Rihanna, and Fenty Beauty and Skin are killing it. Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty is a billion-dollar brand too. Plenty of celebrities have tried and failed to make their brands in this field a hit. It’s an expensive gamble and even the biggest skincare addicts are hesitant to put all that money down for a new product just because a famous name is attached. At least with a booze line, you can still get drunk. If Goop is to survive, my guess is that it will be under someone else’s ownership. Puck certainly seemed to believe that a sale could happen in the future, which would make Paltrow even richer and probably result in more layoffs. Goop’s legacy is secure, but not in a great way. It was a landmark in modern celebrity branding, but it also further legitimized entire swaths of fake science, wellness nonsense, and quackery that was one step removed from anti-vax propaganda. As much as Paltrow tried to laugh off criticism and embrace her ‘white lady bullsh*t’ image, the reverberations of bad science and health-driven fearmongering are far mightier than a vagina candle.

It’s the story of a 16 year old girl who hosts a larger-than-life male Spanish exchange student who proceeds to hook up with most of the girls in her school while she falls in love with him,” reads the film’s logline. Directed by Michael Walker, “The Legend of Juan Jose Mundo” is written by Walker and Susan Gomes. Michael Goodin and Alfred Sapse serve as producers.

It’s been a while. Too long really. But seven seasons on from their last meeting in the Energia All-Ireland, the neighbouring Dublin 6 parishes of St Mary’s and Terenure renew acquaintances at Templeville Road again on Saturday afternoon.

To put it more precisely: The Wall Street giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has now surpassed its iShares Gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets—a remarkable feat given the fact that the former product has only existed since January. The iShares Gold ETF has been offered since 2005; BlackRock acquired the business and brand from Barclays in 2009. As of market close on Thursday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now accumulated an astonishing $33.17 billion in value, according to data self-reported by the firm. BlackRock’s gold ETF now trails that figure slightly, with $32.96 billion in net assets. Bitcoin and gold are often seen as comparable stores of value, with BTC long referred to as "digital gold" by many cryptocurrency advocates. BlackRock’s Bitcoin strength was unquestionably bolstered by Donald Trump’s re-election on Tuesday, a seismic event that has sent markets surging. The day after Trump retook the White House, the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw its highest-ever daily trading volume at $4.1 billion. That activity outpaced even daily volume on blue chip stocks like Netflix, Visa, and Berkshire Hathaway during the same period, according to Bloomberg Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas—a signal of enthusiasm among investors that Trump will indeed make good on his myriad promises to end the U.S. government’s crypto crackdown and champion the novel industry. On Thursday, BlackRock saw its largest ever net inflow for the iShares spot Bitcoin ETF with $1.12 billion. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust U.S. data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt at the time. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs currently on offer on Wall Street, BlackRock’s is handily the largest. The next closest in size, Grayscale’s, currently holds $16.79 billion worth of Bitcoin—roughly half as much as BlackRock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The S&P 500 index surged past the 6,000-point milestone, setting fresh record highs, and small-cap stocks are poised for their best weekly performance since April 2024 as investor optimism surrounding the “Trump trade” continued to fuel a strong risk-on sentiment by the end of a wild week in the market. All major U.S. indices posted modest gains in midday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading slightly, soaring beyond the 44,000-point mark. The blue-chip index is set for its best weekly performance in over a year. Friday's rise in the S&P 500 was powered by the utilities and real estate sectors, which had lagged post-election. Tech stocks took a breather following Thursday's rally. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 7%, pushing its weekly gains beyond 27% and propelling its market cap past $1 trillion. This move now places every "Magnificent Seven" tech stock in the trillion-dollar club, with the group's combined market cap topping $17 trillion. Treasury yields held steady, while the dollar strengthened in response to the Federal Reserve's Thursday 25-basis-point rate cut to 4.5%-4.75%. Gold softened, eyeing its worst week since late May, as both silver and oil dropped over 2% on the day.

Title: AXON’s Sci-Fi Reality Machine: Visionary Leadership In Action

Tony Stark lives in Scottsdale—or at least his doppelganger: Rick Smith, founder and CEO of AXON, a $30 billion market cap leader in public safety technology markets. Few entrepreneurs deserve the “visionary” moniker more than Smith. From AXON’s founding in a garage in 1993, the company has grown from its original Taser products to a multi-billion-dollar enterprise with the purpose to “Protect Lives.” AXON Founder Rick Smith plays up the moon landing theme at the company's TASERCON2023 conference. Over the past five years alone, their shares have returned nearly 700%. AXON joined the S&P 500 in 2023. (FYI, I’m a shareowner.) I recently visited AXON to interview Smith and AXON’s president Josh Isner. (Video of our conversation here.) Smith and Isner represent a rare combination: a visionary leadership dyad. Think, Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX, or Steve Jobs and Tim Cook at Apple. Smith brings the sci-fi. Isner and team create the reality. Arriving at AXON’s headquarters, you’ll enter through a peculiar portal—an oval-shaped stainless steel room managing access via facial recognition (or via their friendly receptionist, Laura Rodriquez). The lobby of AXON's headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, September 27, 2024, modeled after a similar ... [+] lobby in the film Men In Black— though the space suit is an AXON addition. AXON’s communications lead Alexandra Engel quipped with a smile, “Rick wanted an entrance like the one in Men In Black, so that’s what we got.” Catwalks crisscross the complex. That’s due to Smith’s observation that, “every great lightsaber fight happens on a catwalk.” It’s all part of AXON’s dynamic, discerning what customers might desire in the future and making it so. During its first decade, AXON (originally known as Taser) experienced exponential growth and significant growing pains. Smith recalls, “Early in my career I had Steve Jobs syndrome,” so he didn’t listen well to customers. After market-defining initial successes, “we had 2 or 3 contemporaneous failures.” AXON Founder Rick Smith and President Josh Isner join Professor Rob Wolcott at AXON's headquarters ... [+] for a conversation, September 27, 2024. Smith and Isner represent a "visionary leadership dyad," where complementary capabilities, vision and high trust combine to generate long-term outperformance. Smith realized he was part of the problem. "I’m really not good at hiring people [or] having hard conversations.” After Smith’s management epiphany, he started trusting others to run operations, freeing himself to live in the future. As Isner rose to lead sales and eventually to the chief operating role, Smith increasingly relied on him not only to manage the business, but also to challenge him. Isner “pushes back” when the superhero founder goes too far. “There’s this dynamic tension between the two of us, which is good.” Smith connects the dots between customers and AXON’s product development team, while Isner runs the business. Smith muses, “If he weren’t doing this, Josh would probably be Bill Belichick,” referencing one of the greatest NFL coaches of all time. AXON President Josh Isner (center foreground) rallies colleagues at AXON Fest 2024, the company's ... [+] annual leadership confab. Other visionary entrepreneurs faced similar journeys. After founding Dell in his dorm room, Michael Dell eventually learned to rely on exceptional managers like Kevin Rollins to transform the company from a scrappy challenger to industry-leading enterprise. Visionary leadership dyads work when two individuals combine complementary capabilities, vision and high trust to generate long-term outperformance. No matter how compelling the ideas emanating from the C-suite, Smith asserts, “creativity is a team sport.” One of the ways AXON inspires and focuses its teams’ creativity is an approach I call reframing: reframing challenges and asking better questions. Early on, the company focused on making better tasers. That’s great, but not enough to lead the future. Smith admonished, “Our job is not just to sell the next version of taser. How do we make the bullet obsolete? I challenge you guys to give me a weapon that outperforms a bullet in stopping power.” As a result, they started discovering far more innovative answers and offerings. AXON Founder Rick Smith makes a point during an interview with the author and AXON's President Josh ... [+] Isner. Unlike most companies, AXON doesn’t allow its current capabilities and products to define its boundaries. AXON’s vision is bounded by possible future customer needs, rather than by AXON’s current businesses, or even by what customers say they want. AXON’s team listens intently, but also scans horizons. Customers rarely ask for breakthroughs. AXON Skydio drone control and monitoring systems. After partnering with Skydio in the marketplace, ... [+] AXON acquired the company in 2024. In a 2017 future concept video, AXON envisioned a rapid-responsive future of policing. For instance, the video proposed AI-powered completion of police reports from bodycam data—not possible at the time. In April 2024, AXON made it real with the launch of Draft One. Imagine the hours officers can now reallocate to achieving their missions. Starting in the 2010s, AXON closely monitored advancements in drones. In 2018 they launched AXON Air with external partners. Later in 2024, the company acquired two of those drone company partners, Sky-Hero and Dedrone. AXON cultivated partnerships and expertise, building optionality and offerings before the competition. An officer operates an AXON-enabled drone in the field. AXON’s strategy reflects the essence of what my co-author Kaihan Krippendorff and I term Proximity in our recent book by the same name. Proximity observes that digital technologies compel value creation ever closer to the moment of demand. I first started sharing Proximity on Forbes in 2017. AXON brings more and more capabilities closer to the moment of need for public safety professionals. Drones for situational awareness and rapid response, AI-completed police reports, virtual reality for training—anything, anywhere, anytime. That’s quintessential Proximity, and it’s winning. Smith offers a provocative perspective on the ethics of technology and public safety. Reflecting on the 2002 film Minority Report, he challenges conventional wisdom. Many people interpret the film as posing a dystopic future. “They had a technology that took murders to zero in a violent country, took false convictions to zero.” Smith counters that logic. One person gets framed and that invalidates the entire system? “To me, that is an unimaginably crazy good system.” Tom Cruise runs in a scene from the film 'Minority Report', 2002. (Photo by 20th Century-Fox/Getty ... [+] Images) The AXON team engages across the public safety community in rigorous ethical dialogues, which evolve as technologies and threats change. Technologies like predictive AI must operate within accountable systems designed to minimize bias and uphold individual rights. Advancing public safety while maintaining public trust will be essential to ensure communities feel both protected and respected. AXON’s commitment to public safety and technological innovation finds its most ambitious expression in “Moonshot 2032.” AXON’s initiative endeavors to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% over a decade. AXON’s moonshot motivates continuous exploration of public safety challenges, addressed with the latest technologies, equipping public safety agencies to respond faster and more effectively while simultaneously protecting lives. Smith at AXON's Moonshot 2032 launch event in 2022. Smith’s vision for AXON’s future remains bold and cinematic. The company’s stunning new headquarters under development amps the sci-fi theme: more catwalks and a platform reminiscent of the scene from The Empire Strikes Back, where Luke Skywalker discovers his father. Rather than becoming the Evil Empire, Smith aspires for AXON to remain the rebel force. “I’m terrified. I want to continue to be the disruptor—and not the disrupted. Meanwhile, life is better with lightsabers. AXON's 2022 launch event for their Moonshot 2032: Cut gun-related deaths between police and the ... [+] public by 50% in 10 years. The Moonshot manifests AXON's purpose and inspires AXON team members and partners to pursue meaningful positive change. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why Bank Of America Represents An Opportunity In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/08/why-bank-of-america-represents-an-opportunity-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T17:10:32Z

By Daniel Urbina Summary Over the recent months, Bank of America (BAC, Financial) has been in the headlines as legendary investor Warren Buffett sold many of his shares in the North Carolinian bank. With this, Buffett owns less than 10% of the company, allowing him to refrain from reporting his stock transactions from now on. Should retail investors blindly follow Buffett's actions and avoid initiating a position or trimming positions in Bank of America's stock? The answer is no. First, Buffett has many potential reasons to sell the stock, and multiple bearish transactions do not constitute a pessimistic outlook on the stock alone. For example, the sale could be attributed to a portfolio rebalancing. Second, when observing Berkshire's positions, Bank of America represents the second largest holding, and one can't be bearish on a company while holding more than $40 billion in it. Setting Buffett aside, let me explain why Bank of America's current landscape represents an opportunity for investors to be bullish on the stock. The primary source of income for money center banks is usually net interest income from consumer banking, which is what banks earn from lending products after paying depositors and wholesale funders. In Q1 of 2022, a hawkish Fed allowed banks to increase their net interest income as loan demand was still high, and the yields earned were generally higher. Nonetheless, this only lasted for part of the rate hike period as higher interest rates began to make loan originations less appealing. In addition, depositors found money market yields attractive and shifted sight deposits towards term deposits, which are a more expensive funding source for banks. This condition ultimately translated into lower gains from net interest income, and Bank of America wasn't the exception. As illustrated above, the net interest income from the Bank of America Consumer Banking segment began to fall sequentially from Q1 of 2023. Yet, after the Fed's first rate cut, the most recent quarter finally saw a net interest income gain after multiple consecutive drops. With a dovish monetary policy, Bank of America is in an excellent spot to call Q2 of 2024 the net interest income trough and substantially gain from these tailwinds in 2025. Let me explain why. In addition, since the FED's first rate cut in September, the yield curve has steepened as longer-term yields have gained roughly 105 bps. This bull steepener is the best macro scenario for a bank as there are more opportunities for maturity transformation as banks can borrow cheaper on short maturities and lend at higher rates in longer maturities. It is worth mentioning that management had been expecting a net interest income recovery in Q3 of 2024 for over a year. Surprisingly, they hit the estimate at the exact time they expected it. Regarding that, Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan had this to say in the most recent earnings call. "Four quarters ago, we called that a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter of 2024. Even with a rate environment that has bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right. As we expected then, NII indeed troughed in the quarter two. NII grew 2% this quarter and Alastair will note later, we expect NII to grow again in quarter four, even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four." Brian Moynihan, Bank of America CEO. Furthermore, during the conference call, management remained optimistic about the bank's net interest income trajectory and called for a sequential rise once again in Q4 of 2024. "With regard to a forward view of NII, there are obviously several variables at play in the Q4, and we still expect Q4 NII to grow" Alastair Borthwick, CFO. Money center banks such as Bank of America are heavily diversified. Although net interest income tends to be their main source of revenue, other non-interest income, such as investment banking, trading, wealth and asset management, are also factors for top-line growth. The bank has been doing well within these categories, particularly with trading and asset management, due to markets at an all-time high and significant corporate volume in trading activity. Despite investment banking having strongly recovered from 2022 lows, deal activity remains below historical averages, and rate cuts induce more volume within these areas of the bank. For example, with cheaper interest rates, banks are more likely to increase their leverage and conduct buyouts due to higher expected internal rates of return. Nevertheless, the initial 50 bps rate cut from the FED has yet to improve the landscape as long-term rates haven't fallen, and this activity is dependent on longer-term rates. Yet, the outlook for M&A and other investment banking activity is for volumes to increase to historical levels after a prolonged time of high interest rates. The most appalling part of a bullish investment thesis on Bank of America is its valuation. As commented, the bank sits at a potential turning point on its net interest income, and the outlook from the company's side is for the backdrop to improve. Nonetheless, the stock wouldn't be attractive if the bank traded at 3.00x price-to-tangible book value while exhibiting a return on average tangible common shareholders' equity of 12.8%. Luckily for investors, this is not the case. Based on the most recent price-to-tangible book value per share of $26.25 and a closing price of $42.62, Bank of America's stock trades at 1.62x price-to-tangible book, which is unarguably a decent valuation, considering that the 5-year average of the price-to-tangible book multiple is around the corner at 1.60x. Simultaneously, competitor JPMorgan (JPM) trades considerably higher at over 2.3x price-to-tangible book value. In addition, the dividend yield, at 2.30%, is also at its five-year average. With a dividend increase momentum, the current prices set an excellent opportunity for income investors who are seeking a safe and growing dividend despite the moderate value of the dividend yield. Bank of America Provision for Credit Losses Over the past quarters, the provisions for Bank of America's credit losses have increased slightly. Considering that the loan portfolio has stayed basically flat over the year, the bank's cost of risk has risen. Although the bank's asset quality remains resilient, things in the economy could always unfold. If a soft landing does not materialize, the bullish thesis on Bank of America is nullified due to a bank's dependence on economic and credit cycles. In addition, although the valuation remains high, the truth is like the sun; you can't hide it with just one finger. In this case, the stock has risen more than 60% over the past year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 and boosting optimism among investors. Usually, when market sentiment is high, reactions to negative news amplify, and the stock tends to drop more than it should. Yet, positive financials and high market sentiment are the formula for a stock to gain excess returns. To conclude, due to the net interest income recovery outlook, Bank of America's stock is well positioned to continue gaining solid market performances that appeal to investors. A fair valuation allows the stock to continue being attractive to investors despite the enormous price gain of the past year.

Title: Why Bank Of America Represents An Opportunity In 2025

By Daniel Urbina Summary Over the recent months, Bank of America (BAC, Financial) has been in the headlines as legendary investor Warren Buffett sold many of his shares in the North Carolinian bank. With this, Buffett owns less than 10% of the company, allowing him to refrain from reporting his stock transactions from now on. Should retail investors blindly follow Buffett's actions and avoid initiating a position or trimming positions in Bank of America's stock? The answer is no. First, Buffett has many potential reasons to sell the stock, and multiple bearish transactions do not constitute a pessimistic outlook on the stock alone. For example, the sale could be attributed to a portfolio rebalancing. Second, when observing Berkshire's positions, Bank of America represents the second largest holding, and one can't be bearish on a company while holding more than $40 billion in it. Setting Buffett aside, let me explain why Bank of America's current landscape represents an opportunity for investors to be bullish on the stock. The primary source of income for money center banks is usually net interest income from consumer banking, which is what banks earn from lending products after paying depositors and wholesale funders. In Q1 of 2022, a hawkish Fed allowed banks to increase their net interest income as loan demand was still high, and the yields earned were generally higher. Nonetheless, this only lasted for part of the rate hike period as higher interest rates began to make loan originations less appealing. In addition, depositors found money market yields attractive and shifted sight deposits towards term deposits, which are a more expensive funding source for banks. This condition ultimately translated into lower gains from net interest income, and Bank of America wasn't the exception. As illustrated above, the net interest income from the Bank of America Consumer Banking segment began to fall sequentially from Q1 of 2023. Yet, after the Fed's first rate cut, the most recent quarter finally saw a net interest income gain after multiple consecutive drops. With a dovish monetary policy, Bank of America is in an excellent spot to call Q2 of 2024 the net interest income trough and substantially gain from these tailwinds in 2025. Let me explain why. In addition, since the FED's first rate cut in September, the yield curve has steepened as longer-term yields have gained roughly 105 bps. This bull steepener is the best macro scenario for a bank as there are more opportunities for maturity transformation as banks can borrow cheaper on short maturities and lend at higher rates in longer maturities. It is worth mentioning that management had been expecting a net interest income recovery in Q3 of 2024 for over a year. Surprisingly, they hit the estimate at the exact time they expected it. Regarding that, Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan had this to say in the most recent earnings call. "Four quarters ago, we called that a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter of 2024. Even with a rate environment that has bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right. As we expected then, NII indeed troughed in the quarter two. NII grew 2% this quarter and Alastair will note later, we expect NII to grow again in quarter four, even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four." Brian Moynihan, Bank of America CEO. Furthermore, during the conference call, management remained optimistic about the bank's net interest income trajectory and called for a sequential rise once again in Q4 of 2024. "With regard to a forward view of NII, there are obviously several variables at play in the Q4, and we still expect Q4 NII to grow" Alastair Borthwick, CFO. Money center banks such as Bank of America are heavily diversified. Although net interest income tends to be their main source of revenue, other non-interest income, such as investment banking, trading, wealth and asset management, are also factors for top-line growth. The bank has been doing well within these categories, particularly with trading and asset management, due to markets at an all-time high and significant corporate volume in trading activity. Despite investment banking having strongly recovered from 2022 lows, deal activity remains below historical averages, and rate cuts induce more volume within these areas of the bank. For example, with cheaper interest rates, banks are more likely to increase their leverage and conduct buyouts due to higher expected internal rates of return. Nevertheless, the initial 50 bps rate cut from the FED has yet to improve the landscape as long-term rates haven't fallen, and this activity is dependent on longer-term rates. Yet, the outlook for M&A and other investment banking activity is for volumes to increase to historical levels after a prolonged time of high interest rates. The most appalling part of a bullish investment thesis on Bank of America is its valuation. As commented, the bank sits at a potential turning point on its net interest income, and the outlook from the company's side is for the backdrop to improve. Nonetheless, the stock wouldn't be attractive if the bank traded at 3.00x price-to-tangible book value while exhibiting a return on average tangible common shareholders' equity of 12.8%. Luckily for investors, this is not the case. Based on the most recent price-to-tangible book value per share of $26.25 and a closing price of $42.62, Bank of America's stock trades at 1.62x price-to-tangible book, which is unarguably a decent valuation, considering that the 5-year average of the price-to-tangible book multiple is around the corner at 1.60x. Simultaneously, competitor JPMorgan (JPM) trades considerably higher at over 2.3x price-to-tangible book value. In addition, the dividend yield, at 2.30%, is also at its five-year average. With a dividend increase momentum, the current prices set an excellent opportunity for income investors who are seeking a safe and growing dividend despite the moderate value of the dividend yield. Bank of America Provision for Credit Losses Over the past quarters, the provisions for Bank of America's credit losses have increased slightly. Considering that the loan portfolio has stayed basically flat over the year, the bank's cost of risk has risen. Although the bank's asset quality remains resilient, things in the economy could always unfold. If a soft landing does not materialize, the bullish thesis on Bank of America is nullified due to a bank's dependence on economic and credit cycles. In addition, although the valuation remains high, the truth is like the sun; you can't hide it with just one finger. In this case, the stock has risen more than 60% over the past year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 and boosting optimism among investors. Usually, when market sentiment is high, reactions to negative news amplify, and the stock tends to drop more than it should. Yet, positive financials and high market sentiment are the formula for a stock to gain excess returns. To conclude, due to the net interest income recovery outlook, Bank of America's stock is well positioned to continue gaining solid market performances that appeal to investors. A fair valuation allows the stock to continue being attractive to investors despite the enormous price gain of the past year.

Title: Tesla just hit a $1 trillion market cap as Trump's win powers a stock surge

Tesla’s (TSLA+8.11%) market capitalization hit $1 trillion Friday morning, as Donald Trump’s election win has helped the EV maker’s stock surge this week. The company’s share price rose more than 6% to about $313 during intraday trading on Friday. It marks the first time Tesla stock has risen above $300 per share since September 2022. The EV giant is now the ninth largest company in the world by market cap. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s alliance with Trump appears to be paying off, potentially giving Tesla a significant advantage under the new administration — including some influence on the regulation of driverless vehicles, while at the same time putting its competitors at a disadvantage. This includes possible influence over regulations covering self-driving vehicles. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, highlighted that Tesla stock surged 44% over the past 12 trading days, far outpacing the Nasdaq’s 4% gain during the same period. “This is more than just a meme stock,” Munster wrote in a post Friday on X, the social media company owned by Musk. “The accelerating delivery growth next year (flat-ish in 2024 and up +20% in 2025) and the long-term opportunity around autonomy will power the fundamentals that should lead to further price appreciation.” In a post earlier this week, Munster wrote that Tesla’s surge in recent days is broadly “based on emotion, that emotion is Elon made a big bet and was right. This gives investors confidence that his next big bet has a greater potential to succeed. His next big bet is autonomy.” Musk has become a close ally of Trump’s over the past several months, even spending election night with him at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Earlier this year, Musk founded and donated at least $80 million to a super PAC that supported Trump’s campaign. And Musk, who also leads several other firms including SpaceX, is now poised to have some level of role or influence in the upcoming Trump administration. Musk has agreed to lead what he and Trump call a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a commission that would conduct a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government” and recommend reforms. Musk has said he would cut “at least” $2 trillion from federal spending, which is likely a difficult task given that the federal government has spent $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. As part of that job, Musk said he would advocate for a national approach to regulating driverless vehicles — a key market for Tesla — and cut overregulation, which he has repeatedly criticized as holding his companies back. SpaceX, Neuralink, X (META-0.41%), and Tesla are collectively the subject of at least 20 recent investigations or reviews. But whatever his exact role might be in the administration remains unclear. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who is helping lead Trump’s transition team, said before Election Day that Musk would work “adjacent” to the government and be “writing software” to help the government cut back spending. That would likely allow Musk to continue leading his companies without divesting, as he would have to do if he took an official role. While Trump’s victory is good for Tesla, it’s expected to be less friendly to other automakers with EV plans. He’s expected to freeze provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which provided $7,500 tax credits for American-made EVs. Musk has supported ending the tax credit, believing it would help Tesla sales while slamming rivals. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tesla returned to the $1 trillion club Friday, after its stock surged in the days following Donald Trump's presidential election victory. Shares in the electric automaker have soared approximately 23% since Wednesday — a sharp turnaround from a year in which its stock price had otherwise been moving sideways. The new valuation also increases Tesla CEO Elon Musk's net worth to some $300 billion, according to Forbes — increasing his net worth as the world's richest person by more than $30 billion. Musk campaigned aggressively for Trump, who has signaled he intends to appoint the Tesla chief to a role tasked with increasing government "efficiency" that would cut programs deemed wasteful. Through his rocket company SpaceX, Musk has been the beneficiary of billions in government contracts over the past decade. While Tesla has fewer direct contracts, it has been embroiled in multiple federal investigations and regulatory actions that could be dialed back once Trump takes office. Tesla's 13-figure valuation puts it among the ranks of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta. Tesla previously hit $1 trillion in 2021. Demand for Tesla's electric vehicles has shown some signs of weakness in recent quarters, but Musk has said he is staking the automaker's future not on environmentally conscious drivers but rather on a future fleet of autonomous vehicles. On that front, the company now faces competition from Alphabet-owned Waymo, which has already been steadily rolling out "robotaxi" services in several markets.

Title: TSMC is cutting China off from its advanced AI chips

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.02%) is following U.S. efforts to curb China’s artificial intelligence ambitions, reportedly telling chip design firms in the country it will stop producing their most advanced AI chips. The Taiwanese chipmaker told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7 nanometer process or smaller starting on Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the people said. Chinese media site ijiwei first reported the news, according to the Financial Times. While TSMC is targeting advanced AI chips, people told the Financial Times they are unsure if the rules will affect other chips that China’s leading chip firms are designing. The rules will reportedly have a minimal impact on TSMC’s revenue. TSMC said it is a “law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls,” in a statement shared with Quartz, but declined to comment further. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls, and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. “We want to start mitigating before there are solid, structured regulations,” a person told the Financial Times. Another person said TSMC’s decision is “not a show for Trump but definitely designed to underscore that we are the good guys and not acting against US interests.” TSMC’s new rules come as the chipmaker faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. Meanwhile, TSMC’s production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — at its Phoenix, Arizona site are about four percentage points higher than those of comparable fabrication sites in Taiwan, Bloomberg reported. It has also reportedly started making its first chips for Apple at the Phoenix-based fab. This story has been updated to include a statement from TSMC.

Title: Is generative AI hitting a ceiling? Maybe, but investors don’t care

UPDATED 10:37 EST / NOVEMBER 08 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Of course the presidential election looms over everything, and I’ll just say one thing: Any executives or investors counting on President-elect Donald Trump keeping the vast majority of promises he has made are not as smart as they think they are. Maybe they just want their taxes and regulations cut, and they may well get those. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who believe we will now be entering a wonderland of building under a Trump administration, wonder if generative AI models are hitting their limits. A few other people have been baying at the moon about this for a while, so it’s worth pondering what that means for the current boom. Nonetheless, even if the current approach by some to create AGI isn’t the right way to go, that doesn’t mean there isn’t utility for users today, so investors keep pouring the money into AI companies such as Anthropic, Perplexity and Physical Intelligence. Speaking of big spending, those plans by Amazon, Meta and Google to jumpstart nuclear plants to power all that AI? They could take a while. An open letter by Blue Duck Capital Partners to Amazon management this week calls for stock buybacks, more explanation of AI spending, and better management of its original-content ambitions — few of which seem all that compelling ways to spur innovation. It’s still not entirely clear what’s going on with Supermicro’s books, but investors don’t like the signs one bit as its stock tanked again this week as its revenue missed estimates as well. Other earnings reports came in decidedly mixed. Arm and Qualcomm did pretty well partly on AI momentum, and so did GlobalFoundries, but NXP not so much. Cloudflare and Akamai also provided disappointing guidance. Broadcom expanded its VMware private-cloud options, which could prove good timing for the special edge needs of AI. Next week is KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Salt Lake City. TheCUBE will be there and SiliconANGLE will have the news and analysis. I’ll be at BoxWorks in San Francisco too. Earnings reports slow down, but next week we’ll be looking at Cisco Systems and Applied Materials, among a few others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend, for some lean-back reading. Here’s what happened this week around the enterprise: Breaking Analysis: Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s biggest competitor Are generative AI models topping out in their capabilities?

Perhaps some of those are good ideas in concept, but it’s not that convincing to me, especially the stock buybacks front and center. One would hope Andy Jassy and Matt Garman have better ideas.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows

Yesterday, Bitcoin had one of its most bullish days in history, skyrocketing past its all-time high to reach $76,990. This new milestone has ignited widespread excitement and confidence among investors, who now see the potential for further gains. Key data from Carl Runefelt reveals that Bitcoin ETFs experienced a historic surge, with $1.38 billion in net daily inflows. This record-breaking figure highlights institutional demand for Bitcoin, as major players like BlackRock are buying BTC in anticipation of long-term growth. The influx into Bitcoin ETFs underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption, with increasing interest from financial giants as they recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and hedge against economic uncertainty. Runefelt’s analysis suggests that this level of demand is unprecedented, marking a turning point that could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The recent surge is not just a technical breakout but also a fundamental shift driven by institutional confidence, setting Bitcoin up for potential further highs as large-scale investors continue to enter the market. Bitcoin has surged into uncharted territory, breaking its previous all-time highs once again to reach a new peak that has captivated the crypto community. This historic rally comes on the heels of the U.S. election, which saw Donald Trump emerge victorious. Market sentiment suggests that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could have played a role in driving renewed confidence among U.S. investors, who are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge amid changing economic policies. Adding to this momentum, traditional investors increasingly pour into Bitcoin through ETFs, marking a significant shift in institutional interest. According to key data from SoSo Value, shared by prominent analyst Carl Runefelt on X, Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-breaking daily inflows yesterday, totaling an astounding $1.38 billion. This historic inflow underscores the growing appetite from institutional players who are viewing Bitcoin as a critical asset for their portfolios. The recent bullish shift among institutions follows a prolonged 7-month accumulation phase that had cast shadows of doubt over Bitcoin’s potential to break new highs this year. Many investors remained cautious, with market volatility and uncertainty testing their confidence. With institutional backing at record levels, Bitcoin’s recent rally could signify the beginning of an extended bullish phase. As big players like BlackRock buy-in through ETFs, the market sees this as a signal of renewed strength. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next moves, with analysts suggesting the recent price action may only be the beginning of a larger bull run for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is trading at $76,000 after reaching new all-time highs. BTC is entering a strong consolidation phase above the previous record level of $73,800. This price zone is crucial for bulls, as holding above it could provide stability for Bitcoin’s rally to continue. Analysts are closely watching this level; if BTC can respect it, the bullish momentum may persist, encouraging further gains. However, the recent euphoria could lead to a consolidation phase just below $77,000—a level some experts identify as a short-term local top. This resistance could take time to overcome as the market digests recent gains and awaits fresh catalysts for another breakout. Despite potential consolidation, demand remains robust, and on-chain data reflects strong buying pressure that could continue driving the price upward. The technical outlook suggests further upside potential if Bitcoin can stay above $73,800 over the coming days. Bulls are optimistic, as it could establish a solid foundation for the next leg up in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks hovered near record highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq lagging as post-election euphoria ebbed and China's latest stimulus plan fell flat. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Stocks drifted higher to end to a stellar week of gains driven by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's policies will boost the economy. But the initial "Trump trade" rush appears to be fizzling out as Wall Street questions whether Trump will be able to push through his ambitions policies. The dollar (DX=F) and Treasury yields, for instance, have given up many of their post-election gains. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus also dampened market spirits, putting pressure on oil prices, the yuan and local stocks. The $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur a faltering economy. Even so, Wall Street major gauges are still on track for strong weekly wins after racking up more records on Thursday as the Federal Reserve delivered the expected interest-rate cut. The S&P 500 is closing in on crossing the 6,000 level for the first time. On the corporate front, Sony (SONY) shares popped in premarket trading after the PlayStation maker posted a 73% jump in quarterly profit. Meanwhile Paramount Global (PARA) reported third quarter earnings on Friday that showed further improvement in its streaming business it gets ready to combine with Skydance Media. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks flirted around their record highs on Friday as Nvidia (NVDA) following the latest rate cut announced by Federal Reserve. Market euphoria following a Trump White House victory seemed to drift as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. On Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year-to-date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as one of the components of the major average. Here’s a look at the key market themes as you wake up today: China’s stimulus falls short, Paramount misses earnings despite streaming growth, and Nvidia hits a $3.6T market cap. Meanwhile, investors have pulled back on Trump trades, uncertain about his tariff plans. Economic data: University of Michigan consumer sentiment, (November preliminary) Earnings: Canopy Growth (CGC), Icahn Enterprises (IEP), Sony (SONY), Paramount Global (PARA) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia sets record with $3.6T market value after Trump win Paramount revenue falls short as streaming boosts profit Investors dial back 'Trump trades' as policy questions persist Trump win drives $20B surge into US stocks China green-lights $1.4T debt plan to boost economy TSMC to halt advanced AI chip production for China, FT reports How one couple crowdfunded their restaurant dream Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF surpassed YTD flows of 3,000 US ETFs in a single day, becomes top 3 ETF

IBIT now third highest fund flow of all US ETFs in 2024 with $26 billion inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has secured the third-highest year-to-date inflows among US ETFs in 2024, attracting $26.174 billion. With a year-to-date return of 48.52% and assets under management reaching $30.1 billion, IBIT has outperformed many traditional ETFs in both inflows and performance. Further, IBIT’s YTD return is almost double the next highest from any of the other top 10 ETFs by fund flow. However, IBIT’s total AUM is more than ten times smaller than the other top four funds. Top US ETFs Fund Flows (Source: Trading View) Yesterday, Nov. 7, in a single day, IBIT experienced an inflow of $1.1 billion, surpassing the annual flows of all but the top 150 ETFs in the United States. This significant influx exceeds the total year-to-date flows of the majority of the approximately 3,300 ETFs available in the US market. US ETF YTD inflows matching IBIT daily inflow (Source: Trading View) The substantial inflows into IBIT emphasize the outsized investor interest in Bitcoin-based financial products. The ETF’s performance reflects a broader trend of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets within mainstream investment portfolios. Other top ETFs by inflows include Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) with $88.168 billion and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $57.539 billion in year-to-date flows. These funds have year-to-date returns of 25.69%, highlighting the strong performance of equity markets alongside the remarkable gains in digital assets. IBIT’s ascent in the ETF rankings indicates a shift in investor sentiment, signaling potential long-term implications for the asset management industry. The ETF’s success may encourage more firms to launch Bitcoin-focused products, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets.

Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on By BL Bengaluru Bureau Comments READ LATER Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. At the upper price band, Swiggy’s valuation is estimated at around ₹95,000 crore. In comparison, rival Zomato, which went public in July 2021, currently holds a market valuation of ₹2.25 lakh crore. Swiggy IPO GMP is indicating a muted listing gain as the shares of the company are commanding a GMP in the price range of ₹1-2, according to IPO Watch and Investor gain which track the grey market activities. “Swiggy’s growth relies heavily on its ability to expand offerings while retaining and attracting users in a cost-effective way. However, the company faces intense competition from Zomato, which enjoys a broad customer base and strong brand loyalty, particularly in the food delivery sector. This competitive landscape puts pressure on Swiggy’s market share, challenging its ability to maintain and grow its customer base. If Swiggy is unable to retain existing customers or attract new users affordably, it risks negative impacts on its business performance, financial stability, and operational results. Effectively managing these challenges is critical for Swiggy’s sustained growth in the highly competitive food delivery industry,” said Samco Securities “The company is an emerging e-commerce and food delivery technology service provider. It has shown steady growth in revenue over the reported periods but has consistently reported losses. Based on its financial performance, the IPO has a negative P/E ratio and is considered aggressively priced according to other metrics. The management is confident in turning operations profitable within the next few years by implementing their strategy and utilizing the IPO funds to scale up their offerings. Well-informed investors with cash surplus and a higher risk tolerance may consider investing moderate funds for the long term,” according to Bajaj Broking Research. Swiggy has a 34 per cent market share in food delivery compared to Zomato’s 58 per cent, while in quick commerce Swiggy’s Instamart has 20-25 per cent share, and Zomato’s Blinkit has an estimated 40-45 per cent share, according to brokerage estimates. The company is betting big on enhancing quick commerce segment as it plans to allocate nearly ₹1,179 crore to its Instamart business. The company will invest ₹755.4 crore in expanding its dark store network, while lease and licence payments for dark stores would amount to ₹423.3 crore. At the end of the June quarter, Swiggy Instamart had 557 dark stores. The fresh investment will take this number to 741. Swiggy reported an operating revenue of ₹3,222 crore in the June quarter, with its net loss up at ₹611 crore from ₹564 crore a year ago. During the same period, Instamart clocked a gross order value (GOV) of ₹2,724 crore and revenue of ₹403 crore. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Examining the e-cigarette scenario based on distribution, availability, marketing, and banning: A GIS-Based qualitative study in Bangladesh

Globally, over 81 million people use e-cigarettes, and the majority of them are young adults. Using e-cigarettes causes different types of adverse health effects both in adults and elderly people. Over time, using e-cigarettes has detrimental consequences on lung function, brain development and numerous other illnesses. This study employed a mixed-methods conducted between June and September 2023, comprising two phases: Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of available e-cigarette point-of-sale (POS) locations and conducting 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers, along with 5 key informant interviews (KIIs) involving tobacco control activists and policy experts. ArcGIS was employed for spatial analysis, creating distribution and type maps, and buffer and multi-buffer ring analyses were conducted to assess proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics for GIS mapping and qualitative analysis for interview transcripts, utilizing a priori codebook and thematic analysis. A total of 276 POS were mapped in the entire Dhaka city. About 55 POS were found within 100m distance from academic institutions in Dhaka city, which offers the easy accessibility of young generations to e-cigarettes. The younger generation is becoming the major target for e-cigarettes because of their alluring flavors, appealing looks, and variation in flavors. Sellers have been using different marketing tactics such as postering, offering discounts and using internet marketing on social media. Moreover, they try to convince the customers by saying that e-cigarettes are ‘not harmful’ or ‘less harmful’. However, retailers were mostly taking e-cigarettes from local wholesalers or distributors. Customers buy these products both from in-store and online services. Due to the absence of laws and regulations on e-cigarettes in Bangladesh, the availability, marketing, and selling of e-cigarettes are increasing alarmingly. E-cigarette retail shops are mostly surrounded by academic institutions, and it is expanding. Besides, frequent exposure, easy accessibility, and tactful promotion encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. The government should take necessary control measures on manufacturing, storage, advertising, promotion, sponsorship, marketing, distribution, sale, import, and export in order to safeguard the health and safety of young and future generations.

These battery-powered devices operate by heating a mixture of propylene glycol, glycerin, and water with a variety of flavors [2]. From 2011 to 2018, there was a significant increase in the number of e-cigarette users, rising from approximately 7 million to 41 million. This shift made a great impact on consumption pattern and brought about a new era of tobacco consumption [3]. However, despite becoming increasingly popular, e-cigarettes pose serious threats to public health. Initially hailed as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes introduce a novel source of nicotine, a highly addictive substance with so many adverse health effects [4–6]. Additionally, the World Health Organization has reported that e-cigarettes are harmful to health [7]. The heated liquid in the e-cigarette produces an aerosol of small particles that are absorbed by the lungs, quickly passing through the heart, and providing nicotine to the brain [8]. Even the regular use of e-cigarettes has been associated with deaths [9]. Notably, most e-cigarette users are former smokers or dual users, consuming traditional tobacco products, while a smaller group of people who have never smoked [10]. Although e-cigarettes have become increasingly popular among youth and young adults, but its consumption remained low among older adults. The jobless and manual laborers have the highest prevalence of e-cigarette usage, and men are more likely than women to use them [11]. It has found that about 700,000 middle and high school students are vaping every single day [12].Several research papers have depicted the reason why people are more likely to consume e-cigarettes. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),teens who vape may become addicted to nicotine faster than teens who smoke cigarettes, leading to increased vaping frequency and duration, putting them at risk for nicotine addiction [13]. As a result, most of the customers (91%) reported enjoying vaping more than smoking, with 80% preferring non-tobacco e-cigarette flavors. In total, there were nearly 270 different e-cigarette brands available as of December 2022, an increase of 46.2% from January 2020 [14]. A more recent analysis found that these brands offer over 9,000 different devices, which has tripled since 2020 [15]. Researchers also identified more than 15,500 unique e-cigarette flavors available online in 2007 [16]. Among youth users of flavored e-cigarettes, the most commonly used flavor types were fruit (69.1%), candy/desserts/other sweets (38.3%), mint (29.4%) and menthol (26.6%) [12]. An experimental study found that adolescents who were exposed to displays predominantly comprising tobacco products were more willing to use e-cigarettes in the future, compared with those were not exposed to the displays [17]. Moreover, the effects of both e-cigarette retail display visibility, and the availability (both relative and absolute) of products such as food and alcohol and, by extension their visibility, is one of the key factor to change behaviors [18, 19]. According to a another study, the convincing pitches in advertisements greatly influence customer reactions to e-cigarette marketing and their behaviors and actions [20]. E-cigarette advertisements differ from traditional cigarette ads because they often portray their products as healthier alternatives to cigarettes, which can be used as solutions to help people quit smoking [20–23]. A review of various research articles shows that young people in developed countries like Europe and America are more attracted towards online exposure to e-cigarette retail displays on [24, 25]. According to a study, More than 40% of online e-cigarette vendors use loyalty programs, special discounts, and promotional coupons to attract new clients [26]. They also frequently utilize social media to distribute promotional deals, with an average of 2.6 different social media platforms used per seller website [26]. In the U.S., a large proportion of e-cigarettes in the market are imported, with nearly 100% coming from China between 2016 and 2018 [27]. In Australia, there are two possible ways to obtain an e-cigarette: the first is through a pharmacy, and the second is by using the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) personal importation system to import up to three months’ worth of stock [28]. The legal status of e-cigarettes is currently pending in many countries [29]. Many countries such as Brazil, Singapore, Uruguay [30] and India have banned e-cigarettes [31]. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued some regulations for e-cigarettes, including supervision, a minimum buying age of 18 years, premarket approval applications, warning signs, and displaying the list of harmful ingredients [32]. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has now banned conventional smoking in specific public places and on public transport. There are also implemented some regulations for packaging and advertising of these tobacco products [33]. This law significantly reduces the prevalence of smoking and tobacco use among the population. In contrast, there has no laws and regulations regarding the prohibition of the use, selling, promotion, or advertising of e-cigarettes in Bangladesh [34, 35]. To achieve good health and wellbeing (SDG goal 3), we have to strengthen the effort on Tobacco Control by 2030 [36]. Bangladesh government has targeted to achieve tobacco free Bangladesh by 2040. As a developing country, However, Bangladesh currently lack of evidence regarding distribution, marketing, and policy initiatives of e-cigarettes. Additionally, the regulation of e-cigarettes in Dhaka and Bangladesh remains relatively underdeveloped, emphasizing a critical gap in the country’s approach to tobacco control. Thus, this study helps to bridge these gaps by exploring the perception, distribution, availability, planning and banning scenario of e-cigarettes in the retail market of Dhaka, the center of Bangladesh. The aim of this study to provide scientific evidence that can inform future regulatory efforts and enforcing law. This was a qualitative study conducted between June and September 2023. Moreover, this study has been divided into two phases regarding data collection. The first phase generated data concerning Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of the point of sale (POS) of e-cigarettes, and the second phase included in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers as well as key informant interviews (KIIs) with anti-tobacco activists and policymakers at both Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) in Bangladesh, which is also one of the world’s largest and most densely populated cities [37]. In this study, the participants for in-depth interviews (IDIs) were such as e-cigarette vendors who were directly or indirectly involved in e-cigarette distribution, and the participants for the key informant interview (KII) were such as anti-tobacco activists of Dhaka city. Most of the literature advises measuring purposeful sample sizes inductively and keeping sampling until saturation. A total of 20 people were invited to participate in the interview including fifteen participants for IDI and five anti-tobacco activists for KII. However, we got our saturation level before finishing the 20 interviews. The inclusion criteria of the participants were being Bangladeshi citizens and residents, handling e-cigarettes, and ability to talk. On the contrary, the exclusion criteria were including not living in Bangladesh, being a resident without Bangladeshi, do not handling e-cigarette, not willing to participate in the study. Before each of the interviews, the participants were informed about the aim and objectives of the study, if they gave permission then interviews were conducted by the moderators. This study used purposive sampling techniques to the interviewees. The current study purposefully collected data from various participant settings (e.g., street e-cigarette shops, residential e-cigarette shops, hybrid e-cigarette shops, dedicated e-cigarette shops etc.) to ensure the strength of the data. For GIS mapping, all e-cigarette outlets in the study area and their GPS coordinates were recorded. Stores that sold any kind of e-cigarette were considered as point of sales (POS). E-cigarette outlet coordinates were collected by six pairs of trained enumerators after attending 3 days of training session. The enumerators determined the e-cigarette outlet by looking for e-cigarette displays, seeing the purchase of e-cigarettes, or approaching the retailer personally in cases when none of these were apparent. The enumerators completed an electronic checklist on Kobo Toolbox embedded in their mobile phone. It included POS ID, name of POS, type of POS, GPS coordinates of e-cigarette shops and selling points, advertisements placed in the shop, and any institutions located near 100m and 500m within the shop. In this section, this study analyzed the distribution of e-cigarette shops, and types of shops, and assessed their proximity to academic institutions and hospitals. The collected GPS points are extracted from Kobo Toolbox and imported into GIS software, specifically ArcGIS for spatial analysis. For GIS mapping, this study used ArcGIS Pro software by ESRI (licensed version) and the scale is 1:100000. The POS location points collected from fields are plotted in the GIS attribute for mapping and showing the distribution of those POS. All the GIS maps are solely developed by the author. The output maps are produced using projected coordinate system of UTM (Zone 45N). In the GIS environment, firstly a distribution map of e-cigarette shops across Dhaka City was formed, encompassing both the North and South City Corporation areas. This map visually represents the spatial dispersion of e-cigarette shops. Additionally, a secondary map is generated to categorize the several types of e-cigarette shops. This provides essential information on the specific classifications or categories of e-cigarette shops present within the study area. Moving forward, a buffer analysis is undertaken to ascertain the distribution of e-cigarette shops within a defined radius of hospitals. In this case, a buffer zone of 100 meters is established around hospital locations to identify which e-cigarette shops fall within this designated zone. To further assess the proximity of academic institutions to e-cigarette shops, a multi-buffer ring analysis was conducted to determine the presence of academic institutions within specified distances, such as 100 meters and 500 meters, from e-cigarette shops. Multiple buffer zones were created around the e-cigarette shop locations to facilitate this evaluation. The qualitative interview guideline was formed through the analysis of pertinent and significant literature, and pre-testing was carried out before of the data collection. Through the use of an open-ended questionnaire, data were gathered based on the respondents’ convenience. Before of the interview, brief descriptions of the study’s background, objectives, eligibility requirements, confidentiality, anonymity, and informed consent of each responder were provided and explained pleasantly to the interviewees and attached also in the first page of the guideline. The IDI guideline was formed, including questions such as perceptions regarding e-cigarettes, the e-cigarette distribution process, marketing strategies concerning e-cigarette distribution, and so on. In addition, the KII guideline was also formed based on perceptions about e-cigarettes, the import mechanism of e-cigarettes and how to reduce the importation of e-cigarettes, the concept of distribution and marketing strategy of e-cigarettes, if there is any support for reducing/banning e-cigarette use in Bangladesh, and so on. Prior to the interview, each respondent was provided full informed consent and made sure that the participants understood the reasons for inviting, the risks, privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality, as well as their right to withdraw and not participate. In the interview, we also ensured that they were under no obligation to continue and might end at any time. Interviewers made an effort to find a location with the fewest disruptions. Most of the interviews were around 45 min, and the audio was recorded to ensure validity. Additionally, we got their permission to record the interview on audio. The field notes were also taken to address any extra essential information. To facilitate the exploration of the inner meaning and uncover the phenomenon under investigation, data were gathered in the native language of the respondents. To maintain the anonymity of each respondent, we assigned ID numbers to them. The interviews had to be transcribed verbatim, coded, and summarized by the proficient native Bengali data enumerators. Finally, no incentives were provided to study participants to encourage their participation. This study created geographical maps with ArcGIS Pro software by ESRI. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were computed to find out the proportion of POS in each city corporation and the percentage of POS types. On the other hand, transcripts of the interviews were read and reviewed carefully, coded under different themes, and finally were analyzed by narrative review method. To ensure accuracy, the transcripts and audio recordings were cross-checked for any inconsistencies. A priori codebook was used, which was developed through reviewing relevant literature and the thematic analysis was performed following the themes identifying techniques [38], where texts were extracted and summarized through manual coding. Finally, to explain the results, the data were methodically indexed, synthesized, and evaluated. The interviews were conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration, and the highest ethical standards were maintained throughout the study. Ethical permission was obtained from the institutional review board (IRB), ‘Biosafety, Biosecurity & Ethical Committee’ (Ref No: BBEC, JU/M 2023/05 (30)) of the Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Dhaka. Furthermore, individual informed consent was taken from all participants who read/understood the purpose of the study before data collection. We found a total of 276 e-cigarette shops in Dhaka City, among them the majority (56.5%) were in Dhaka North City Corporation followed by Dhaka South City Corporation (43.5%). Among the POS in both South and North city corporations, the highest POS type was watch or sunglass shops (26.8%) followed by dedicated vape shops (26.4%), cigarette shops (17.4%), and cosmetics shops (12.7%), electronics shops (4%) etc. (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.t001 The bar graph illustrates the percentage of POS distribution based on City Corporation. In DSCC, the highest percentage POS type was watches and sunglasses shops (40%) followed by dedicated vape shops (20.8%), cigarette shops (18.3%). On the other hand, in DNCC majority was dedicated vape shops (30.8%), while the same proportion of watch/sunglass and cigarettes shops were noticed at 16.7% (Fig 1). The distribution of several institutions is presented in Table 2. The bar graph illustrates the percentage of POS distribution based on City Corporation.

It is observed that most of the POS located at shopping malls in both city corporations, whereas 55.0% in DSCC and 37.8% in DNCC followed by 5.1% (DNCC) and 2.5% (DSCC) in residential house, 3.8% (DNCC) and 0.8% (DSCC) in super shop (Fig 2). Moreover, advertisements related information has been depicted in Fig 3. In Table 2 presents the diverse types of institutions found within 100 meters of different POSs according to observation. Highest 39 (48.1%) colleges, 36 (44.4%) high schools and 15 (18.5%) hospitals were found within 100 meters of different POS locations. We got only one kindergarten within 100 meters of one of our POS locations. The diagram shows the percentage of different institutions within 100 meters of POSs according to observation. In Dhaka North City Corporation, the highest number of institutions that were found in front or within 100 meters of POS location were colleges (59.2%) and high schools (53.1%) respectively followed by coaching center (20.4%), primary schools (18.4%) etc. The lowest percentage of kindergartens (2%) was found near different POS locations. On the other hand, in Dhaka South City Corporation, maximum percentage of institutions was found within 100 meters of POSs were colleges (31.3%), high schools (31.3%) and hospitals (31.3%) followed by banks (25%), Clinics (18.8%) etc. while the lowest percentage was for coaching centers (6.3%) (Fig 4).

It can be observed that the majority of advertisements were displayed as posters (64.1%). Additionally, 23.1% of the advertisements were displayed as billboards, while the remaining 20.5% were shown as banners.

The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of e-shops in both Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation (Figs 5 and 6) respectively. For instance, within Dhaka North City Corporation, it is identified that 16 e-cigarette shops are situated within 100 meters of academic institutions. Similarly, within Dhaka South City Corporation, there are 39 e-cigarette shops within 100 meters of academic institutions (Figs 7 and 8) respectively. The e-cigarette shops located within the 100-meter buffer zone of hospitals are visually represented on the map (Fig 9). This visualization allows for a comprehensive understanding of the spatial relationship between e-cigarette shops, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. Finally, the maps generated from the spatial analysis are carefully interpreted and analyzed to identify the patterns of e-cigarette shop distribution and their proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. This analysis has significant implications for understanding potential health risks associated with e-cigarette usage in close proximity to healthcare facilities and educational settings. The results of the buffer and multi-buffer ring analysis are graphically represented on the map. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of e-shops in Dhaka North City Corporation. From the map, it is evident that Uttara, Mirpur, Gulshan, Banani, and Adabor are the areas with the highest concentration of e-shops in DNCC.

E-cigarettes do not contain tar. It uses synthetic nicotine. Since it is vaporizing, it does not seem to be a big deal. It may have featured a coil system and was installable with a liquid that has a sticky appearance. Four components, Propylene glycol (PG), Vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and nicotine must all be present in a juice to be used. Propylene glycol, sometimes known as PG, is a colorless, odorless liquid. Vegetable glycerin, on the other hand, referred to as VG has a little sweet flavor and a slightly thicker consistency. According to the responses of retailers: The electronic cigarettes were rechargeable and looked like long pens. It was compatible with liquid installations and included maybe coil system.” [R03.001] “Regarding devices, the crucial elements are the battery, the Power IC for control, and the coils for activation. These coils are crucial for the process of converting the e-liquid into vapor. When it comes to e-liquids, there are four essential components that you need: propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and nicotine. All four elements are essential for an enjoyable and satisfying vaping experience.” [R01.001] E-cigarette retailers believe that these products pose fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes due to their adjustable nicotine levels and lower nicotine content. However, they also mentioned some negative aspects- such as water can lodge in the lungs causing blockages and leading to abdominal gas. However, if nicotine is consumed in excess, several issues may arise. For example, stomach issues, one also has headaches, sinusitis, and migraines. Additionally, it has a nicotine tobacco flavor, which increases the risk of heart attack, certain flavors are ice flavor, which causes a cold, and occasionally it affects the throat and causes cancer when used frequently. Regarding all of these issues, retailers have confessed that: “Everything has side effects. ome chemicals are safe to breath, while others are harmful to human health. Consuming fruit-flavored juice will not affect your health. Fruit-flavored juice will not harm your body if you take it. When you consume that clone juice you will be harmed. Because they do not maintain food grade. Burning anything produces a tar that is inhaled and causes bacterial infections, as well as cancer due to chemicals.” [R03.007] “Blueberry drink is often unsuitable for a large number of people, who often choose not to consume it. However, few people complain of gastrointestinal discomfort from its use. Besides, I have not seen any trouble so far. If you smoke cigarettes for 90 to 100 years, then the risk of cancer is 100%. E-cigarettes are not carcinogenic. Cancer cells remain dormant in our body until they are triggered into activity by our unhealthy lifestyle choices. Subsequently, the cigarette is regarded as a medium that individuals believe is responsible for certain outcomes.” [R03.001] The key informants of our study talked about the health hazards associated with e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes contain non-natural substances, such as chemicals and juices, which can lead to various forms of cancer and affect the organs when burned. Other illnesses, such as asthma, may also manifest as well and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur. In addition, e-cigarette use by children can hinder brain development and, with prolonged use, may lead to a decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ). Furthermore, long-term nicotine use is likely to raise our risk of heart attack or stroke due to the atherosclerotic disease process that nicotine causes. “E-Cigarette contains nicotine means e-cigarettes are harmful to health and I say e-cigarette is never a substitute for a conventional cigarette I say it is not safe. Formaldehyde and acetate are very harmful to the body. As I have said before, even in our developed countries, there is a lot of research on e-cigarettes. The Japanese say that this cigarette is 10 times more harmful than normal cigarettes, because of its use which may lead to the development of various diseases including stroke, heart attack, or cardiac attack. E-cigarettes are in no way less harmful than traditional cigarettes.” [KII-05] “Long-term use of nicotine may lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition that increases the likelihood of heart attack or stroke. In addition, the presence of additional compounds in the substance might occasionally provide a danger of pneumonitis or lung infection. Furthermore, it is seen with many impurities due to which people have died. Nicotine is the cause of our addiction. It harms brain development when used by children. It may gradually decrease the level of intelligence if it is used extensively.” [KII-04] People between the ages of 20 and 35 are the most common users, and the younger generation tends to smoke it more frequently. The age range of female consumers is 18 to 40 years old, while that of male customers is 18 to 60 years old. Although children utilize it now, but the sellers do not support them in doing so. Since there are no rules there, children purchase from the sidewalk. Street vendors would profit more if they could sell more goods. “A mother of an intermediate student once came into the store complaining that her son was unable to concentrate on his studies without vaping. Another time, a 15-year-old boy arrived, and we advised him to start vaping after a few days. Later, the mother of the youngster arrived and said, "I’ll buy it for my son, so why should you have any problems?" [R03.007] All types of customers come here but the sellers do not sell to kids. People their 25 years and 30 years old make up the largest attendance group. The younger generation makes the most use of it. Although people of other ages visit as well, teenagers appear to come mostly to purchase vape. Older individuals, including those in their 40s and beyond, also frequent the place. Both lone individuals and groups make up the bulk. Middle-aged individuals typically smoke a large quantity of cigarettes throughout the day. They then encourage their friends who smoke to transition to e-cigarettes rather than continuing to smoke. Thus, friends influence friends. More boys come, while the number of girls is very limited. School-age students now visit during tiffin breaks and smoke cigarettes in tea stalls. “The majority of my customers are younger buyers, particularly those under 15 years old. Most of them are students, with boys from well-off families above 20 years old also making up a significant portion of my customer base. Around 70% of my customers are boys, while the remaining 30% are girls. Many of the girls are regular customers, with 5–6 of them coming to buy regularly. They usually come alone rather than in a group, except for the 7/8-year-old school children who come in groups. Additionally, it is common for one friend to bring another friend to buy on different days.” [R12.012] “The target audience is typically 18 to 24 years old. It’s becoming popular online, especially with active internet users who post cloud photos on Facebook. It’s a trending topic and can go viral” [RA12.001] “Small children also come but we have fewer here, go to the shop in Kurmitola and many school and college students come to buy e-cigarettes. Kids get interested in e-cigarettes by seeing others using them or seeing e-cigarette devices. And the boys and girls of Dhaka are a little more updated.” [R04.016] Everyone knows that cigarettes are bad for people in this day, particularly in the age of social media. However, users of e-cigarettes prefer to consume them to stop smoking. They believe that e-cigarettes are a safer option. E-cigarettes are less dangerous when compared to traditional cigarettes as they do not produce Bad odors. Here, there is more flavor addiction than nicotine addiction. In addition, it has become a direct fashion, so everyone wants to try it. There is a growing trend among the younger generation to associate vaping with being trendy and cool. Unlike traditional cigarettes, which emit strong odors and are often not tolerated in many places, e-cigarettes can be used almost anywhere. But people can use vape everywhere. Due to having these kinds of advantages people like to use e-cigarettes. “The reason is flavor addiction. Nicotine addiction is less here, flavor addiction is more. When you have a mango flavor in your mouth all day long, when you have an apple flavor, it feels a little soothing. So, there are the main things, flavors. They come back for the flavor.” [RA08.001] “Those who are over 30 years old are mostly smokers. They use vaping to abstain from smoking. People of this type mostly come to me. Some people come and tell me I want to quit smoking and suggest some flavorful vape. Some come here to buy vape due to the scent and flavor. I think most importantly people are using vaping as a substitute for smoking. If you light a cigarette near anyone, they think badly about them. If you do vape people do not think it is bad. It is seen that many have quit smoking due to vaping” [RA12.002] “The first reason behind this is that the customers consider this thing to be safe by using it by them. They did not have any problems. In addition, as the way we told them to use it, they follow that. By doing so they enjoyed vaping” [R01.001] In Bangladesh, e-cigarettes are not manufactured by any company. Instead, e-cigarette importers bring in various vaping devices and juices from other countries. These products are then supplied to wholesalers, distributors, and retailers in Bangladesh. Retailers from dedicated vape shops, other physical stores, and online stores sell e-cigarette products directly to consumers. “I brought all kinds of devices from China. Although the original brands are from the USA and UK, the products are manufactured in China. In addition, some Swiss ones are made in Switzerland that are very expensive. But they do not come to Bangladesh now, they used to come earlier” (R03.001) “All my juices here are from America and all devices are from China” (RO4.013) “…These companies are foreign companies. In our country no vape is produced, vapes come from outside countries. We have no authority over this matter” (RA12.002) “USA and China. I order the devices from China and liquid from the UK and USA. Liquid is also available in China, but we do not import” (R03.005) Our study respondents have shared that Mirpur, Gulistan, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Baridhara, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, etc. are the major hotspot of e-cigarettes. One of our responses mentioned that there is a factory in Chakbazar, from which they get the e-cigarettes. “In terms of availability, I would say Dhanmondi. In addition, if you say in the case of use, then in that case I will say Gulshan or Banani” (R01.001) “You will find it mostly in the Chalkbazar. If you want to see new types of vapes, you can visit Chalkbazar. They go wholesale there. Friendship market, 10 no. Lane. You can find more information regarding vaping there. They buy thousands of pieces” (RA12.002) Respondents also stated that e-cigarette marketing is expanding in places where more wealthy people stay. According to them, many people are already accustomed to these types of cigarettes and these are becoming available in every shopping complex. “You can find them in New Supermarket, Mirpur, Elephant Road, and Bashundhara City. Vapes are now sold in every shopping complex as an essential item, just like rice and fish. Sometimes using vapes makes everyone look smart” (RA12.001) “There are many shops in Gulistan. The residents of that area have more money, while the people in our area have less. It’s important to understand that there is a strong connection between the e-cigarette business and its location.” (R04.016) Long-term vaping has been shown to have negative health impacts; its replicas may even be more detrimental. In the case of inquiry regarding the availability of replicas, retailers emphasized that they are selling the original product imported from abroad, but there are many sellers of e-cigarettes in Chawkbazar, Newmarket, and Old Dhaka engaged in selling replica products. “I do not know if it is in Bangladesh or not but maybe in China. Dhaka New Market and Street Shop sell clones/replicas; they seem to sell Chinese juice. I am selling American Juice” (RO4.013) “I do not know that brother. It may happen. Nothing is impossible here, everything is possible…If you want to see them, then you will have to walk around the streets of Chawkbazar, Jinjira” (R04.016) “Replica means disposable devices; there are some clones of disposables in Bangladesh. There are several clone products available in Newmarket, they import them from China” (R05.001) Retailers’ comments indicate that e-cigarette duplicates are produced nearby, notably at Chawkbazar. Although it is challenging to replicate the device, fake juice may be made cheaply and sold for a lesser price. Since many people cannot afford the original e-cigarette and its fluids, these could boost marketing among the general public. One person described the procedure for creating replica juices, which he had heard from people he knew. “However, apart from the authentic products, clone products are available in the Round Square under the foot over the bridge and in the new market with budget money. We sell 100 ml in 1800 to 2400 taka. They sell 30 ml for 300 taka, which we cannot imagine. Replica juice does not come from another country; they are made in our own Bangladesh. Made in Jinjira and sold in Chawkbazar. The whole thing is distributed from Chawkbazar. Pod devices are not usually cloned. They are difficult to clone. Mod devices are often cloned” (R03.007) Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, etc. are being used extensively as a way of buying and selling different kinds of products. Online marketing of e-cigarettes is also growing in Bangladesh. These also allow the sharing of necessary information regarding e-cigarettes, like their flavors, prices, promotional messages, delivery process, etc. Our study respondent stated that online media have made the e-cigarette business and delivery process easier as well. Online media, apps, and websites related to shopping, such as Daraz are also involved in e-cigarette marketing. “…Yes, Facebook, and Instagram. The page is mainly for online delivery of parcels. We don’t post videos on YouTube. Customers can place orders via WhatsApp and receive home delivery. We only deliver through Instagram if someone comments on the product’s picture or sends a personal message.” (R03.007) “Through online, we do business through our Facebook page. We also have a website. However, if it is in the case of wholesale, then it is normal to talk on the phone. So roughly, you can catch these dealings through WhatsApp or over the phone” (R01.001) “No, I do not give Ads. Daraz gives an ad… Yes, everything is available in Daraz. Over 90% of goods are sold in Daraz” (RA08.003) Moreover, some retailers also shared that in-store selling of e-cigarettes is more feasible for them. According to them, the promotion of this specific product in social media may become the reason for governmental sanction. Retailers have to keep themselves busy by selling different kinds of products at once in their stores. According to them, e-cigarette sales are more in their store than the online platform. Online business for e-cigarettes has become tougher for them, except for the dedicated e-cigarette shops. “Online promotion of tobacco products is prohibited by the government, and this also extends to social media.I do not know if it goes to foreign countries. Online sales for tobacco products are generally poor, as most transactions occur in physical stores” (R03.001) “Long ago, I had a Facebook page called "Gazette King" where I posted pictures. Now I do not run it. My shop sells more than the page. Those who have free time can browse the page. I do not have that time” (R12.012) A few retailers acknowledged that they offer electronic cigarettes offline as well as online. “Both online order and direct selling… Since home delivery is an option, many people also want to visit the shop… I would say 20% is online. We have many in-shop customers” (RA08.001) To promote products retailers rarely use postering or other offline marketing. Dedicated shops for e-cigarette marketing use online marketing strategies more than that of physical stores that sell these devices as a side business. They depend on online marketing strategies more and advise customers to see or give reviews on Facebook and other business apps. Discounts are offered occasionally, but it is not maintained according to any specific product or occasion. First-time customers are given some benefits. To generate interest in their products, they have a range of eye-catching e-cigarettes featured on their website (also, their Facebook page features numerous images of e-cigarettes) for their eyes to perceive the attraction. In addition, they just say they will sell it at a low price, even if the customers take the flavor they will sell it also at a low price. The people who see the product know the value, and that is why they buy it. Therefore, there is nothing to make lucrative here. They try to give advertisements, but there is a risk of banning the page. Customer satisfaction and taste addiction are also factors. There has been observed an alluring representation of different types of devices in the store. Retailers also use verbal explanations and motivation, which convince them to buy e-cigarettes. Some statements of respondents are given below: “I always ask customers about their vaping needs, whether it’s for creating big clouds or to help quit smoking. Based on their response, I introduce them to different products. I had mentioned earlier that e-cigarettes can be harmful, although less than traditional cigarettes. We tell people that it is also harmful to those who do not know. Keep a few interesting e-cigarettes now and then. We do not show. We put a variety of interesting e-cigarettes on the online page (Facebook page) just to make people interested that we have some interesting vapes in our store. So that the attraction works in their eyes” [R03.001] “I will sell it also at a low price. There was a separate display case for vaping on one side of the shop. A customer was shown an interesting vape device that looked like a pistol” [R12.012] “It is more or less, everyone involved in marketing. Anyone who has any stock is taking pictures and just sharing them. Just this. Because of the way our vaping thing is, we do not need to make it lucrative here. Many people recognize the value of our product and that’s why they buy it” [R01.001] During the pandemic, companies have provided e-cigarettes to households via social media. Therefore, since there is no law, they take advantage of every tactic at their disposal to attract customers. They have chosen to target a specific age group, especially the young generation, so that is where they will draw it out and brand it to sustain the business for a long period. After conducting research, the tobacco businesses discovered that lowering the price is necessary to reach more individuals. They are using a technique to lower the price because of this. They might be strategizing ways to reduce the cost of the products. The market will grow as more people become dependent on it. In addition, in the drama industry, the producers and directors receive financial support to maintain scenes featuring smoking electronic cigarettes for promotional purposes. “The marketing strategy seems to involve targeted social media campaigns. Users who are in the young group are sent targeted messages with information and in terms of marketing they use online marketing mostly and now it is available in different stores and different markets” [KII-04] “I have seen that they have targeted an age group, meaning the target group is where, even under the grave, they will pull it out and then brand it. Therefore, not only an educational institution but also the age group, that age group is their target. They grab a group between the ages of twelve and twenty. So, if they can make them addicted, I said they will do business for up to 75 years. They will not show much interest in an old 55–60-year-old person like me. Since I could pass away before I turn eight or ten years old. There is no profit in investing in this business. So, they target the place where that age group is available [KII-01] “The tobacco companies have researched and found that if it is to reach people, they have to bring down the price. That is why they are bringing down the price by strategy. They may be planning how to make the devices cheaper. They have a plan. Nothing happens to them without planning. When he becomes dependent, the market will expand. It may be, now their sales are maybe 10,000 per year. So, if the price is reduced it may increase the sales to 20000 per year” [KII-02] “It seems to me that the promotion is an increase in dramas, which was not before. Coca-Cola spent a lot of money to feature the brand in an Aamir Khan movie. So now, if they show smoking, maybe they take at least a few cores to show a smoking scene for only 10 seconds to 20 seconds. These are industry promotions. In drama, it is the producers and directors who are given money to keep this scene in our drama industry promotion. And especially if there is a popular actor-actress, and in our OTT platform, I do not see that much, but I have heard from people who study that the hero is in a bad mood, takes e-cigarettes, drinks, takes cigarettes, even when he is in a good mood. The matter is like that” [KII-03] The sellers emphasized promoting e-cigarettes by expressing that, these e-cigarettes can cause some harm, but they are still less than traditional cigarettes, which is yet unproven. The customers unaware of those statements become well-informed, while the aware do not need an explanation beforehand to buy e-cigarettes. They offer options to customers and give them a polite explanation when they arrive. When a consumer visits, the sellers first try to understand their preferences and reasons for vaping. Customers who were trying to give up smoking were assisted in selecting juice. “Normal cigarettes have bad smells. Maybe that causes them problems. Their wives may scold them for smoking. If they use vape, they will not have any problems. At home, they can use vape too.” [RA12.002] “When a customer comes to us, we first try to understand his preferences and why he wants to vape. If he comes to quit smoking, we help him choose juice.” [R05.001] “In my opinion, if you like it, then go ahead and take it. When you take it, the smoke will come out, but if you don’t take it, the smoke won’t come out. This is just the approach. I do not tell someone to buy it. I do not tell them it is good, take it.” [RA08.003] E-cigarette sales are largely dependent on liquid and device quality. Only those who are aware of e-cigarettes purchase the devices; others do not. On Facebook, the sellers do only post. The vast majority of the sellers do not write sales-oriented statements outside the shop. Their clients handle the majority of their marketing. Because a satisfied customer will refer five more customers to purchase the product. Therefore, the sellers do not need that type of marketing that much. “It has to be said that the customer will not understand which is good and which is bad. Flavor, device, price, and quality are different. It is better than smoked cigarettes, I usually say. If the smoke is more, the quality will be better. If the coil is damaged, you can change it here. You will get liquid of many flavors, I will keep less money, its quality will be better—this is what I say” [R12.012] “I will not say any such slogans or statements. Slogan base statement we will give when we protest it. We do not need to protest. We are doing something good. If you want to join us, you can join. There are many anti-alcohol protests, but there are a few people here who are anti-alcohol. So, we do not have slogans for these things. We are providing safer options if you can join you can join. See how you like it. If you like the culture, then you can live with it” [R01.001] Retailers stated that they do not offer any advertisements about the marketing of e-cigarettes, although they have been noticed on Facebook sites, YouTube, and Instagram. Facebook features advertisements, and users have the option to see reviews and watch videos on vaping. Sometimes, Daraz occasionally runs advertisements. “No, brother, currently YouTube is your platform for giving reviews. We mainly operate through reviews. For example, we recently reviewed Jellybox, and we set the Google price at 2600, but we sold it for 2400. We offer discounts on each product” [RA12.001] “Every shop has signage outside. Like we have the ‘Vape in’ (shop name) logo outside in large form. So, we keep all branding up to the shop. Yes, there is a review system. However, this culture has not yet developed in Bangladesh” [R01.001] Among them, one of the people shared his experience in another way as if he had seen an ad regarding this: “I have seen an ad for another shop. Like a few days ago, “BARBIE” came out. Like this they took a picture which has “TANBIE” with the picture of the vape” [RA08.001] The majority of the sellers do not give any written advertisement. People do not post product details that much now unless it is a second-hand selling post. Maximum people know about vape, in that case, sellers give the name of the product and the flavor of the juice. If customers want to know the rest, they can search on Google. “No (Smiling). I have never seen an advertisement for e-cigarettes.” [RO4.013] Some of them shared that some written statements they use for marketing like- It is less harmful than smoky cigarettes, waking up and smelling vape, and so on. “Coil it, wick it, juice it, vape it; Eat, sleep, vape; It’s glamorous on film but it’s not glamorous, waking up and smelling vape like an ashtray; Keep calm and vape like an ashtray; More stronger, more tasty; Under age 18 is prohibited” [R03.007] Regarding giveaways for retailers to promote e-cigarettes, the majority of the sellers shared that they do not get anything regarding this, if a device breaks, it is the vendors’ fault, and they are not even eligible for a refund. However, gifts are provided when something is sold in the market as well and those who import it may get it. “The thing is that vape is now sold at large. No need for them to give discounts. The wholesalers buy them from foreign countries. If they buy them at a cheap price, they can give some discount. Getting a discount from the company is not possible. These are for limited profit” [RA12.002] “I used to get it, but now I do not get it. When a new design or model of a product comes, they would give a new model along with the previous product model. They said that a new one has come and please check the device without cost.” [R03.001] Regarding sales, there is a single computation. Sellers might increase sales by lowering their prices. Because not everyone can afford to purchase vaping items at all. The internet pages must be visited, posts must be created, and they must be promoted to enhance sales. Opening more locations in well-located retail centers will be necessary to boost e-cigarette sales. The difference is in how things work offline and online. Selling products online has the potential to boost sales. People prefer to purchase more things when they watch the advertisement. Additionally, there are cash-back incentives, which is a wonderful addition. “In order to boost sales, we need to open online pages, create posts, and promote them. While there are some complications, they are manageable, and the main challenge is the time commitment. The sale of any item depends on marketing, if the marketing is good, the sales will increase.” [R04.016] Despite the high costs, they wish to open a new branch. If the system for cash back is implemented, it will benefit them. But if it is all governed by the established guidelines and oversight, they will also help to promote it. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s recent declaration regarding e-cigarettes is a cause for alarm, though. “First we have to create the market, we have to expand the business, and then we have to do the promotion. Now it is too late to bring the product. However, when everything is regulated by an official organization, everything will be under supervision, and then there will be demand. I will get the product quickly. Then the market will be created.” [R03.007] Regarding the views of the sellers, rather than prohibiting it, the government should promote it. The sellers have no control over it. If the government bans it, they will do other business. Alcohol and cigarettes are legal. Even if the government forbids them, they are powerless to challenge its decisions because their decisions are final. After that, they will stop selling it. Apart from banning e-cigarettes, smoking should be outlawed at the same time. Again, British Tobacco has been pressuring the government for several years to ban e-cigarettes. Because e-cigarettes have caused a decline in their sales in the market. However, the seller plans to tell the government, that if e-cigarettes are less harmful than normal cigarettes, then they should not stop them. “if the government closes it, I will do another business. If it closes, there is no problem; there is no lack of business. And I am a small one and those who have big businesspeople will think about them.” [RO4.013] “If they ban it, we will be at a loss. It will be better if they do not ban it. People of all ages can use it. And cigarettes cannot be used everywhere. E-cigarettes can be used everywhere, and smokers of all ages can use them. There is no obstacle. If you stop it, the bad people, the drunk party people, will get more addicted to other substances. If they vape, the risk will not be so much.” [R12.012] One of them also shared regarding governments’ approach to forever banning e-cigarettes in the future in another way like “They (government) have tried. But we have powerful people. We will fight to continue it. Because I know cigarettes are bad. Now if the government of Bangladesh wants people to die by smoking cigarettes that is fine. We will try our best.” [RA08.001] In response to inquiries, key informants of our study have shared some challenging issues for E-cigarette banning in Bangladesh. One of the main obstacles to limiting the marketing of e-cigarettes is their addictive nature, which stems from their thousands of flavors and appealing designs. Some of the respondents claim that those connected to the e-cigarette wholesale industry could obstruct the enactment and maintenance of e-cigarette control legislation. Furthermore, a few massive tobacco industries may have influenced legislators. Nevertheless, to expedite the e-cigarette ban, the health ministries must work harmoniously with other ministries in an integrative manner. “The business of addictive products is enormous. As a result, consumers who purchase these products often behave irrationally. Their behavior is not rational when it comes to buying these products. Even when they know that addiction is a risk, the price does not deter them. Their addiction is driven by the product’s flavor. Despite being aware of the negative consequences, they continue to support the business. These consumers are so heavily influenced that they cannot grasp the logic behind their actions. It all boils down to the money going into the pockets of those behind the business, which the consumers willingly spend.” [KII 1] “Regarding the challenge of the ban, I said that those who are very normal, those who are associated with this business, those who are planning this business, and those who will produce it in this country, want this law not to be passed, maybe they will delay this law. They will do two things, first not to pass. Compromise will come in the second stage, weakening it a bit. What do you mean weak? They will say that it is not a ban, they will talk about control. As we call the Tobacco Control Law, so is the E-Cigarette Control Law. That is how to control it”. [KII-1] “The first is that tobacco companies are giant companies. They influence everything from the policy level. Therefore, this is a big challenge. And their tactics are bad, they create influence where there are policymakers to motivate them in different ways. So that is a challenge for us. Another big challenge that we face is that we policymakers need to look at these issues from a public health perspective; as this is a public health issue” [KII2] “It seems that there are significant challenges related to industry restrictions. The Ministry of Health has tried to initiate changes to the law in order to protect public health. However, there is a lack of support from other ministries such as the Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, and NBR. It appears that these ministries prioritize financial gain over public health, making it difficult to enact the necessary changes. This lack of support has ultimately prevented the correction from taking place. It seems that there are internal barriers preventing the progress of these crucial amendments. [KII 3] For Bangladesh’s e-cigarette ban to be successful, it is crucial to implement specific measures to oppose the extensive marketing and promotion of these items. Currently, there is no law in Bangladesh regarding e-cigarettes. Based on the responses from our key informants, we know that campaigns against e-cigarette banning have been going on for more than three years. Furthermore, the government of Bangladesh has already drafted a bill that will shortly be approved by the parliament. Additionally, there is a variety of non-governmental organizations and anti-tobacco organizations working on awareness campaigns about these problems. “There is no law, there is nothing. We tried to say, it should be banned. And the campaign is going on for 2–3 years… and the government has decided in principle, a draft has been prepared. Now it was supposed to be raised before this election in the cabinet, no, after the election we hope, if there is no major interference, it will be passed here and then it will be passed in the parliament. Therefore, this has been a movement from civil society for a long time. The Government is also motivated, the Ministry of Health of the Government has made a regulation” [KII 1] “There are different foundations they create front groups to bring these things, create business groups like we all know “Smoke-Free Foundation” they promote this e-cigarette all over the world as harm reduction” [KII- 4] “Not only NGOs, all the anti-tobacco organizations in Bangladesh are working on it, that it is harmful to the body and health, that it should be banned, all the anti-tobacco organizations in Bangladesh, not only a particular NGO, BCCP, who give you these grants, also work on it”. [KII 1] “We held press conferences, rallies, discussion meetings, and wrote different articles…Our organization has a Facebook page called Tobacco Free Bangladesh. If you go there, you will see that we posted about this cigarette. We also have a YouTube channel called DAM-Health. There we made a video about e-cigarettes and gave a message to make people aware. We re-share those videos on Facebook. In this way, we are making people aware… At the national level, not only us but many organizations, and some other anti-tobacco organizations have conducted programs on e-cigarettes. However, at the local level, I do not think anyone is doing it at the district level or upazila level. Because till now it remains a national issue because there is no law.” [KII -2] “No, there is no finalized law and policy in Bangladesh so far. The Tobacco Control Act of 2005 has been amended once in 2013 having some loopholes. The revision work is still ongoing. This has been proposed in this amendment of the Act… Organizations working in the tobacco control community. As I work for people many other foundations work for people. Like the National Heart Foundation and Ahsania Mission, we have some alliances with doctors and the media. E.g., Bangladesh Anti-Tobacco Alliance, and Anti-Tobacco Media Alliance. Some such alliances and some individual organizations and individuals are doing the work regularly” [KII-5] We can incorporate certain important steps to regulate or restrict e-cigarettes in Bangladesh based on the key informant’s responses. Its importation must be halted under the particular HS code. Strict regulations should be in place surrounding the marketing of e-cigarettes, and those who sell these products without a license must be compensated. The purchase of electronic cigarette devices should be restricted based on age and information about the harmful health effects of e-cigarettes. Since children and adolescents grow up in monitored environments, we can make sure that their use of e-cigarettes is strictly prohibited. The sale of e-cigarettes in the stores next to various educational institutions ought to be prohibited. Since e-cigarettes are portrayed as a healthy substitute for regular cigarettes, we can raise consciousness about the negative health impacts of e-cigarettes and encourage smokers to pursue other nicotine replacement therapies. “The first thing is that importation with HS code should be stopped. Imports should be stopped and then other routes that come in should slowly tried to be stopped. Apart from that, to stop the distribution, if you give the facility to import with HS code, then to distribute it—it is a legitimate product, anyone can distribute & sell it as they can. We did not arrange the license or anything like that.” [KII 4] “Already e-cigarette has been banned in India… It is prescribed as a prescription drug in the UK. Those who wish to quit at once and it is not being given to anyone under 18 years of age… meaning there is an age limit. In America, they have made a rule that no flavor can be given. It is only given to those who want to quit tobacco, but they have banded off the flavors that would have been given to attract children. Besides, many other countries have completely banned it. At the local level, it should strictly ensure that children do not come to school with this item…Now the average initiation age for e-cigarette sage in Bangladesh is 15–16 years old… Doctors also are prescribing because it is available in the market. If it becomes illegal then there is no chance to prescribe…We have nicotine replacement therapy for nicotine, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges…” [KII 4] “I have no idea about reducing distribution. I have no idea about the distribution mechanism. It has to be Law/Policy Implementation. The sale of e-cigarettes under the age of 18 cannot be implemented in our country. We have to ban it…import, export, production, marketing everything is prohibited…All types of production, marketing, sale, purchase, and marketing should be banned. Besides, we cannot give a healthy Bangladesh to the next generation. Our present people who are in policy-making, will not be alive anymore, they are supporting such activities and misdeeds for their benefit. Those who come after that will be victims of it. And many people will get sick, the young generation will suffer, and it will drive them to other addictions.” [KII-3] This study provides insights regarding the availability, distribution, marketing strategy, and possible ways to reduce e-cigarettes in Bangladesh. First of all, the participants of the study perceived e-cigarettes as long, pen-shaped rechargeable devices that may have included a coil system and installable liquid with a sticky appearance that uses synthetic nicotine and does not include tar, which supports earlier research showing that e-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat and aerosolize "e-liquid." [39], and which requires inhaling vaporized nicotine during consumption [40], and the dangerous ingredients found in regular cigarettes, such as tar and carcinogens, were absent in e-cigarettes [40]. This study also shows that there are two main differences between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes: conventional cigarettes contain more nicotine than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes do not contain tar, which can lead to cancer. According to a previous study, it was found that many people believed e-cigarettes to be healthier than traditional cigarettes because they do not contain tar, smoke, or carcinogens [40]. Some participants also noted that e-cigarettes have lesser side effects than conventional cigarettes and help to normal cigarettes cessation. These findings are consistent with a previous study [41]. Regarding e-cigarette health impacts, our research found that besides serious issues like blockages, water can lodge in the lungs and produce abdominal gas. Additionally, using e-cigarettes may result in headaches, migraines, sinusitis, and gastrointestinal problems. It also contains nicotine tobacco flavor, which raises the risk of a heart attack; some varieties, like ice flavor, give you a cold. Sometimes, if you use it repeatedly, it causes cancer in the throat. The majority of the results are consistent with other researches showing that e-smoking can increase the risk of lung cancer and induce symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, choking, burn injuries, irritation of the upper respiratory tract, dry cough, and dry eyes and mucous membranes [42, 43]. Some of the participants in our study stated that e-cigarettes are more frequently smoked by younger individuals and their age range is between 20 to 35. Girls are extremely rare, while boys are more prevalent. Prior studies also showed consistent results, younger age groups are more likely to have ever used or are now using e-cigarettes [44]. Use of e-cigarettes is higher among boys but girls are increasingly at risk [45]. Some participants of this study also reported that children buy from the sidewalk because there are no restrictions there. However, there are few studies to compare these findings with therefore more extensive research is needed to bolster these conclusions. To guide future research on e-cigarette, use among teenagers and young adults and to inform policymakers and consumers about making evidence-based decisions, a thorough grasp of this literature is necessary [46]. Young individuals who use e-cigarettes run the danger of using cigarettes in the future. Since banning tobacco products has been shown to lower youth smoking rates, strict regulations pertaining to e-cigarettes are necessary for prevention [47]. Our findings revealed that e-cigarette importers usually import different types of vaping devices and juices from abroad. Similar findings were found, most of their e-cigarettes device and liquid come from abroad in Norway [48]. Our study respondents shared that Mirpur, Gulistan, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Baridhara, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, etc. are the major hotspot of e-cigarettes and some retailers’ sale replica of e-cigarettes in some place. To compare our findings there has not been found any previous study regarding this result. Our study revealed that e-cigarette distribution mostly occurs on online platforms such as Facebook and You Tube, this finding aligns with previous studies conducted in the United States. The majority of consumers had bought tobacco or e-cigarettes through online platforms, and both online and offline buyers noted that price and convenience had influenced their decision to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes from the online sites [49]. Furthermore, social media platforms serve as the main channel for e-cigarette distribution in Thailand [50]. Some participants in this study also highlighted that sometimes discounts are available, and many of the individuals who see the goods are aware of their value, which is why they purchase them. Moreover, addictive flavor and customer satisfaction are always in demand among customers, and if they can offer an outstanding flavor, it will work better to promote the e-cigarette brands. These findings are also consistent with a study [49] which found that there are four main reasons why people buy e-cigarettes online: price (cheaper online, discounts, buying in bulk); product characteristics (quality, availability); buying experience (time, convenience, reading reviews); and curiosity. In this study, regarding motivating the buyer’s approach to selling e-cigarettes, the retailers provide options to clients and greet them with courtesy upon arrival with a polite explanation, and customers attempting to quit smoking receive assistance in choosing juice. It also aligns with another study that found that individuals preferred to make purchases in person due to the opportunity to visually see, physically experience, and handle the goods, as well as receive guidance from store in person [49]. However, the quality of the liquid and device has a major impact on e-cigarette sales. The devices are only available to people who are aware of e-cigarettes; others who are not or do not buy them. The customers they serve do most of their marketing. The retail channel is the primary means of marketing cigarettes, as evidenced by a prior study that showed the bulk of cigarette companies’ advertising and promotional budgets were allocated for its distribution [51]. However, further extensive research is needed to address the lack of available literature on promotional statements regarding e-cigarette sales. Moreover, the majority of sellers, according to the report, do not provide written advertisements. When merchants disclose the product name and juice flavor, the majority of individuals who are aware of vaping use Google to find out more information regarding this and they also find reviews and videos on vaping on Facebook or YouTube. At the same time, vendors give some promotional speeches pleasantly related to the marketing of e-cigarettes. An earlier study showed that e-cigarette businesses’ marketing tactics have been linked to the rise in young users and video advertisements on digital platforms were found to be the most prevalent approach [52]. A previous study [53] also revealed that, using terms associated with the promotion of e-cigarettes, YouTube has been utilizing for this and consistent with this study. This study also found that retailers may boost e-cigarette sales by reducing their prices. When customers see advertisements, people tend to buy more products. This finding is in line with an earlier study that also found that sponsored events and social media advertising might be crucial parts of an effective e-cigarette marketing plan to boost e-cigarette sales [54]. Additionally, the offering of cash back incentives might serve as an effective strategy to enhance the sales of e-cigarettes. This study also made clear that every individual has a unique profit and sales volume, which vary based on where their stores are located In our study the majority of interviewees disclosed that they did not receive anything from the wholesalers or merchandizers; even if a device malfunctions, it is the vendors’ responsibility, and they are not even qualified for reimbursement. Since this was not included in the earlier research, a large-scale mixed-method study ought to be carried out to make this finding more generalizable. Nonetheless, the majority of vendors are happy with their businesses, and they want to launch new branches despite the high startup costs. They will also aid in its promotion if everything is in their favors. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s recent declaration regarding e-cigarettes is a cause for alarm, though. A previous survey also showed that a large number of states and towns have changed their smoke-free legislation to restrict public usage and ban the sale of e-cigarettes [55]. For instance, it appears that while they are happy with the sales of e-cigarettes, the prospect of a ban is a significant obstacle to their ability to operate their business sustainably. This study analyzed the potential future scenario of governments completely prohibiting e-cigarettes and found that sellers have no influence or control over this decision. They will conduct business elsewhere if the government outlaws it and they cannot contest the government’s judgments since they are final, even if it forbids them. Previous research indicated that electronic cigarettes (ECs) might pose a significant public health risk in the future for India, which is the world’s second-largest tobacco consumer with over 65% of its population under 35 years old. For now, it appears that outlawing ECs in India is the most practical course of action [56], and following example set by Punjab’s lead, other Indian states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala also banned e-cigarettes. Additionally, countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam have already banned e-cigarettes [32]. Thus, resilient regulatory measures and an outright ban on e-cigarettes are required to avert future health concerns. The use of very effective marketing and promotion tactics has significantly increased the popularity of vaping and e-cigarettes. These efforts have attracted new consumers by offering innovative vaping products, causing substantial damage to the tobacco industry [57]. According to our study findings, there is a necessity of actionable laws and regulations regarding e-cigarettes in Bangladesh. In August 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a formal regulation asserting its jurisdiction over e-cigarettes. This regulation established a minimum age of 18 for purchasing e-cigarettes and introduced standardized requirements, including premarket approval applications, disclosure of harmful and potentially harmful ingredients, and the use of cautionary labels [32]. All web-based sellers of e-cigarettes have to be obliged to inform customers with clear precautionary information, at the very least in the form of wording that is visibly shown on the homepage. It ought to be against the law for them to use marketing strategies, such as complimentary samples, incentive schemes, and sales campaigns, etc. [26]. Additionally, we also found out that, our experts recommended strengthening licensing requirements, imposing age restrictions on purchases, stepping up awareness campaigns about the negative health consequences of e-cigarettes, and continuous license verification for e-cigarettes selling etc., in the perspective of Bangladesh. Similar findings was found to regulate e-cigarettes, its sale is prohibited in some number of nations and in some country there need license to sale those product [58]. Many nations have implemented rules regarding the import of e-cigarettes [58]. However, one of the biggest controversies about e-cigarettes is whether these gadgets are used for medicinal purposes or as recreational substances [59]. The biggest obstacle we confront is that many young people mistakenly believe that these products are healthier substitutes for traditional, smoke-filled cigarettes. For this reason, outlawing e-cigarettes is far more important than controlling them. Therefore, enacting laws that expedite the approval process, developing robust rules about the usage of e-cigarettes, and developing future regulatory mechanisms to solve obstacles to minimize the marketing of e-cigarettes could be several good approaches regarding this issue. Our study had some limitations. First of all, presenting compelling statistical data was difficult when employing the qualitative approach. Second, the interviewer occasionally felt uncomfortable responding to the questions since they were unaccustomed to delivering information using the qualitative approach, which occasionally made it difficult to determine the meaning in detail. In order to provide a universal appeal, large-scale researches that take into account the mixed-method design should be carried out to investigate this topic further. This study offers a comprehensive exploration of the e-cigarette landscape in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. It uncovers significant insights into production, distribution, marketing strategies, and health perceptions. The findings undergo the urgent need for regulatory interventions and create public awareness initiatives to address the complex challenges arising from the widespread availability and marketing of e-cigarettes, particularly among the youth population. E-cigarettes are being sold in various shops where people usually go for their necessary belongings like cosmetics, watches, sunglasses, confectionary items etc. and most alarmingly surrounded by academic institutions that are expanding. Moreover, these vaping devices are being imported into Bangladesh under different codes as well as other unrecognized ways from abroad. This exposure and accessibility encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. Customers purchase e-cigarettes through online and offline means and the sellers motivate them that these are less harmful options compared to the traditional ones. The study contributes valuable knowledge for informed policymaking and public health strategies to mitigate the potential long-term consequences of e-cigarette use in the context of Dhaka City. It emphasizes the importance of a coordinated and proactive approach to safeguard public health. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.s001 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.s002 (XLSX) All those who participated actively in this study are gratefully acknowledged by the authors.

U.Today - In an extraordinary demonstration of demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. funds saw a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion as Bitcoin itself hit new all-time highs. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s IBIT fund dominated the inflows, attracting a record $1.12 billion of the total, reflecting the hype of recent events and a growing appetite for regulated BTC exposure among traditional investors. Most definitely, more and more people are weighing in on Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which shows that investors are beginning to prefer safe, regulated Bitcoin-based financial products over direct exposure. This increased interest is a sign that the retail side of the market is moving toward digital assets, especially as institutions like BlackRock offer access to the cryptocurrency through structured and compliant investment vehicles. Meanwhile, this ETF-driven activity parallels Bitcoin's upward momentum, with the cryptocurrency hitting all-time highs for three consecutive days. Ethereum-based ETFs have also caught the attention of investors, recording the third-highest single-day inflow in history, bringing in $79 million during the last trading session. This development suggests that interest in crypto-backed financial products may extend beyond Bitcoin, suggesting a more diversified approach by investors looking to tap into a wider range of digital assets or trying to catch up through beta, as Ethereum lags significantly behind BTC in terms of price action.

Investing.com -- It's no secret that stock investors have been bagging juicy gains in November, pushed mainly by the market pricing in a second Trump mandate, the end of election uncertainty, and a persistently dovish Fed. But while virtually all bulls are getting their fair share of profits, the magnitude of these gains will vary wildly. That's where ProPicks AI users are leading the pack. In fact, only in the first week of November, they garnished an eye-popping 35%+ gain on three stocks. To wit: Now, honestly, what was the last time you bagged results like that without the help of advanced machine-learning-powered stock-picking models? I sure haven't. But there's no need to worry; there's still time to get all our picks for November with up to 55% using this link, as part of our exclusive Early Bird Black Friday sale. Already a Pro user? Make sure you've seen this month's list! On top of these rallies, our users are also getting big bucks on several earnings season winners. In fact, just to talk about today, they are already up 15.2% on Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), which has just crushed earnings and forward guidance. But how do we do it? Is it some sort of 'AI magic?' Of course not. ProPicks AI works because it offers a simple, industry-recognized approach to fundamental analysis by using extensive sets of data big data modeling. By comparing all stocks in the market at a glance, it manages to surface several hidden gems with investment-grade precision, thus improving returns and helping lower risks.

Title: Trump’s return could herald a ‘crypto golden age’ says CEO of stablecoin firm Paxos

Cryptocurrencies surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, as crypto investors hope for a more friendly regulatory regime under a Republican president. Flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin briefly surpassed $75,000; other tokens like Ether and Dogecoin saw significant gains. Trump’s election creates “a real opportunity for a crypto golden age,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, a New York-based blockchain platform, on Friday at the Singapore Fintech Festival. “The Trump campaign had a real crypto theme around it, and there’s a sense all this pent-up demand could be unleashed by the U.S. and turn the U.S. into a leader from kind of a laggard,” he explained. The Republican campaign promoted Trump as a crypto-friendly candidate, accepting donations in cryptocurrency. Trump said at a bitcoin conference in July in Nashville that he would ensure the U.S. never sells off its Bitcoin holdings if he returned to the White House, and that it would be a policy in his administration to keep 100% of the Bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires in future. He also said he would establish a crypto presidential advisory council and create a national “stockpile” of bitcoin. A Reuters report in August, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, claimed the U.S. holds about $11.1 billion in crypto, which includes 203,239 bitcoin tokens. Washington’s stash of cryptocurrencies come from criminal seizures from government agencies like the FBI and IRS. Trump also launched World Liberty Financial, a “decentralised finance” initiative centred around a crypto token called WLFI in September. In October, World Liberty Financial revealed it was slashing its fundraising goal in a regulatory filing. The company now plans to raise up to $30 million from investors, a 90% reduction from its initial target of $300 million. Other speakers on Friday suggested that the U.S. was already moving towards a more crypto-friendly stance. Eric Anziani, president of Crypto.com, said “a clear direction was set” when Bitcoins and Ethereum ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. The approved ETFs included funds from well-known investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco. Global regulators are also starting to treat crypto as a more mainstream asset. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, pointed to new Bitcoin ETFs in markets like Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. Yet “the election [marks] the beginning of a new era,” Anziani said. A new Trump election could give more clarity on cryptocurrency regulations. The size of the U.S. market could then jumpstart the crypto industry, Cascarilla argued. Billionaires with ties to the cryptocurrency industry, including Elon Musk and the Winklevoss twins, had endorsed or donated to Trump’s campaign Crypto firms have blasted Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, for cracking down on U.S.-based cryptocurrency firms. Investors now hope that a new Trump administration will replace Gensler with someone more friendly to the crypto sector. “The SEC for the past few years has been waging a war on [the crypto] industry,” Monica Long, president of Ripple, said on Friday. “It’s really hard to navigate an environment like that.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Good morning. Jay-Z has 99 problems, but Block ain’t one…for now, anyway. Executives at the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey—or is it Rick Rubin? I can barely tell their beards apart these days—have ordered staff not to mention the board member and Beyoncé spouse on internal channels, according to Fortune colleague Kali Hays. No one’s quite sure why, but successive layoffs at music streaming service Tidal—which Block quixotically bought from Jay-Z—haven’t helped. Perhaps Dorsey should channel zenmaster-megaproducer Rubin after all: “Do what you can with what you have. Nothing more is needed.” —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. Airbnb said Thursday it wants to accelerate its growth and prepare for the company’s next chapter “beyond accommodations.” In a letter to shareholders, the lodging marketplace said it made headway making it easier for people to host, making its namesake app more helpful (including clearing out low-quality listings), and expanding beyond its core markets. The last point is most interesting. Airbnb operates in a number of countries and regions it considers “under-penetrated.” In Q3, the company said it was able to boost the average growth rate of nights booked in those markets to more than double its core set. Airbnb reported $2.73 billion in third-quarter revenue, barely beating Wall Street’s estimates. It also reported earnings per share of $2.13, just missing expectations. As for its future beyond lodging? We’ll see “next year,” the company says. Speculation runs rampant for what that means, but rest assured the company will leverage its strength in building a “moat,” as CEO Brian Chesky put it last year, around its existing customer base. —AN Baidu is reportedly preparing to unveil a pair of smart glasses with a built-in AI assistant. A new Bloomberg report says the company, which is to China what Google is to the U.S., plans to showcase the product at its annual company event in Shanghai next week. The specs will have all the usual trappings: built-in cameras for photos and videos, a built-in microphone for voice interactions, and Baidu’s Ernie large language model underpinning it all. Hopefully the product will look as good as Meta’s Ray-Bans, which were released more than a year ago in partnership with global eyewear juggernaut EssilorLuxottica. The combination of tech and style has proven unbeatable—who doesn’t look good in a pair of Blues Brothers-esque Wayfarers?—even if the underlying tech is getting long in the tooth. Baidu will reportedly charge less than Meta’s $300 for its eyewear, which is expected early next year. But like Meta’s specs, the real question is how well it accelerates use of its various Internet-connected, ad-based services where the revenue is really made. —AN Remember the days when people were having conversations about armies theoretically using AI? Now AI has been used in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza (for drone piloting and target identification respectively) and AI companies are jostling for space at the Defense Department’s table. Days after Meta announced a bouquet of partnerships with military contractors, Anthropic, Palantir and Amazon Web Services have revealed a three-headed competitor. Anthropic’s Claude LLM will be integrated into Palantir’s intelligence-analysis system, with the whole thing running on AWS. Amazon is Anthropic’s biggest investor, and the pair already offer their joint services to the U.S. government. OpenAI, which quietly changed its terms earlier in the year to allow this, is also now looking for DOD business. It’s now the military-AI-industrial complex. —David Meyer Shares of Pinterest took a double-digit-percentage dive, to about $29, in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company offered fourth-quarter guidance below Wall Street’s expectations. The social media company said it expects Q4 revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. The midpoint of that range trails analyst estimates of $1.143 billion. Pinterest’s CFO, Julia Donnelly, said on a conference call that the company saw softer demand from food and beverage advertisers in Q3, dragging down its $898 million in quarterly revenue (which was otherwise up 18% from the same period last year). That will continue in Q4, she said—which aligns with the outlook of other ad-based businesses during the recent spate of corporate earnings reports. Another thing to note? Pinterest’s expenses. They were up 17% year over year, to $904 million, from R&D investment and spending on employees with AI expertise. —AN Tech’s biggest executives pretty much ignored Donald Trump after he won the White House in the shocking presidential election in 2016. This time around? Not so much. According to various reports over the last few months, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg privately reached out to Trump before voting began for the recent election. “They flattered him,” a New York Times summary reads. “They shared their troubles. They criticized his opposition. They emphasized common enemies.” And they hoped for better business. Trump went out of his way during his first term to criticize—or outright punish—the tech companies who opposed him. After Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in 2016 that Trump’s stated refusal to concede the election if he lost (he didn’t) “erodes our democracy around the edges,” among other things, Trump allegedly pushed the Pentagon to deny Amazon’s cloud computing unit a $10 billion defense contract. (A lawsuit was later dismissed.) Fast forward to today. The Washington Post owner published on X just two days ago: “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella all had similar things to say. And the remaining Magnificent Seven tech CEOs, you ask? Tesla’s Elon Musk has hardly slowed in posting support for Trump on X, which he owns; meanwhile Nvidia’s Jensen Huang manages to escape with a nearly nonexistent social media presence. —AN —Binance billionaire “CZ” speaks after four months in prison. —Cloudflare expects softer sales in the wake of stiffer cybersecurity competition. —Toast has a blowout quarter. Shares of the restaurant app were up 15%. (Yes, chef.) —CFPB told workers not to use phones because of hack. Living life in a Salt Typhoon. —France regulator sniffing around Polymarket gambler.

Title: Mozilla Foundation cuts staff and eliminates advocacy division, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff”

Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Plus, Amazon CEO denies RTO mandate is ’backdoor layoff’ Greetings, comms pros! Let’s look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% of staff while also cutting its advocacy function The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit wing of the company that makes the Firefox internet browser, is cutting jobs and getting rid of its advocacy function amid “a relentless onslaught of change”. Mozilla Foundation CCO Brandon Borman affirmed the layoffs in a memo to staff. According to Tech Crunch : “The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward,” read the statement shared with TechCrunch. After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that “advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundation’s work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas,” without providing specifics. Mozilla is known for advocating for privacy and inclusion on the internet. This move brings some of that ethos into question going forward. For comms pros, it’s worth asking — what do you do when your company cuts a big part of your identity as a way of remaining stable? There’s no right answer, but one of the solutions is to dive headfirst into employee experience as it ties into brand identity. Show your employees they matter and hedge that in messaging that proves you’re still the great place to work they were onboarded with originally. Organizational identities change — that’s part of business. But you can remind people that the cultural positives they relate to are the same — that’s how you communicate your way through these types of major shifts. 2 . Amazon CEO says RTO process isn’t a pretext for layoffs Amazon chief Andy Jassy denied that the company’s RTO mandate wasn’t intended as a method of covertly cutting jobs, but instead as a method of making the company’s culture stronger by having employees in the office five days a week. According to Reuters: “A number of people I’ve seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it’s a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities,” said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said. It’s interesting to see the head of a company as big as Amazon address the speculation around an RTO process head-on. RTO programs should always consider culture as a guidepost for both the rollout and communication of the initiative. Any well-done RTO process needs to follow a checklist of sorts to find success. Earlier this year, we outlined RTO success points. The best RTOs can get off on the right foot by doing the following: It’s not enough to just say that culture matters — you need to show it in action. Once you call your people back, give them reasons to appreciate their time in the office, like more upskilling initiatives with colleagues and face time with leaders. There are benefits to working in the office — comms pros should highlight them, allow leaders to talk about them, and make them a central part of company culture beyond lip service. 3. NLRB files complaint against Apple for threatening employees who talked about compensation and work-from-home benefits The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against tech giant Apple, alleging that the organization threatened repercussions against employees who talked about their pay or working from home. MSN reported that according to accounts from former workers at the company, Apple employees were allegedly threatened when talking about bonuses, ordered to delete a social media post about how other employees could continue working remotely, and forced to stop mentioning their pay on internal comms platforms. Another, software engineer Cher Scarlett claimed that she was forced out of her role for creating an internal survey for employee compensation. Apple has yet to comment on the allegations. When employees feel they’re in a more open environment, they’re able to be their authentic selves and more likely to stay. In 2023, we covered the topic of job-hopping and how to combat it. In that piece, we cited a Flexjobs survey that stated 62% of employees cited toxic work environments as one of their top reasons to leaving a company, followed by pay at 59%. If your employees can’t talk about things they want to improve or their pay, there’s a good chance they won’t stick around, and those numbers prove it. Sure, Apple is one of the biggest-name corporations on the planet. But that doesn’t mean that the same rules don’t apply to employee satisfaction. Outreach via surveys and other touchpoints can help communicators gather information from employees about how they feel on topics like compensation, benefits and more. Running that info up the ladder to leaders can then affect change. Encourage your people to share their views. If you stifle them, you’re sowing the seeds for discontent and poor culture. 4.

By Martin Pengelly in Washington, A new book by the chief architect of Project 2025, a hugely controversial policy plan for a second Trump term, repeatedly employs imagery of fire and burning, including calling for rightwingers to “burn away the rot” of American institutions and organizations deemed opposed to conservative aims. The news comes after a White House address on Thursday, two days after Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, when Joe Biden called on Americans to “bring down the temperature” after months of heated political battle. Mixing classical quotes with cliche (“it is time to fight fire with fire”) and metaphors about forest fires and Smokey Bear , Kevin Roberts, president of the far-right Heritage Foundation, advocates “a long, controlled burn” of targets including the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the New York Times, “every Ivy League college” and even the Boy Scouts of America. Related: ‘This victory is a mandate’: rightwing groups ready with policy proposals for new Trump administration Roberts’s book, Dawn’s Early Light : Taking Back Washington to Save America, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy, but the book has proved controversial already. This summer, news outlets used review copies to report violent imagery in an introduction by the Ohio senator JD Vance , Trump’s vice-presidential pick, and to highlight both Roberts’s own violent language and his work on Project 2025 . Roberts’s original subtitle – Burning Down Washington to Save America – also attracted attention, as did incendiary language in promotional materials. As Trump sought to distance himself from the book and Project 2025, including by lying about not knowing Roberts, publication was postponed until after election day. Now, with Trump victorious, Roberts’s heated rhetoric seems likely to alarm progressives all over again. Beginning with a quote from Virgil’s Aeneid – “My spirit kindles to fire, and rises in wrath to avenge my dying land” – Roberts writes: “In 2020, our country went up in flames. “Some of those conflagrations were intentional arson, such as the ‘mostly peaceful’ protests [for racial justice after the police murder of George Floyd] that caused more than a billion dollars in damage [a controversial claim ] in some of America’s greatest cities: Others were more unintentional, such as the record-setting California wildfires that torched more than 4 million acres of our most beautiful forests. “In fact, all those fires were connected. They spring from a conspiracy against nature – against ordered, civilized societies, against common sense and normal people – orchestrated by a network of political, corporate, and cultural elites who share a set of interests quite apart from those of ordinary Americans. “… Be it Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the cities or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the countryside, the … playbook is the same: destroy the embodied institutions that define the American way of life and replace them with ideological commitments and bureaucratic imperatives. “It is time to fight fire with fire.” Alluding to prominent Project 2025 aims – including political purges of the federal government and legal attacks on groups including women and LGBTQ+ Americans – Roberts continues: “Fire has the potential to destroy … To escape our current darkness, restore America’s civic life and take back our country for good, conservatives can’t merely continue putting out fires; we must be brave enough to go on the offense, strike the match and start a long, controlled burn. “There’s plenty of fuel. Like deadwood in a forest, many of America’s institutions have been completely hollowed out … Decadent and rootless, these institutions serve only as shelter for our corrupt elite. Meanwhile, they block out the light and suck up the nutrients necessary for new American institutions to grow. For America to flourish again, they don’t need to be reformed; they need to be burned. A nice start would include: “Every Ivy League college, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, 80% of ‘Catholic’ higher education, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, the Boy Scouts of America, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, the Chinese Communist Party, and the National Endowment for Democracy.” Roberts does not elaborate on qualifications for his list. But it does contain one name that may jar with rightwing readers: BlackRock, a major financial firm, has been a key investor in Trump Media & Technology Group, the president-elect’s social media company. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s billionaire co-founder, has been linked to an appointment as treasury secretary under Trump. Turning from Virgil – and the composer Gustav Mahler – to Smokey Bear, Roberts says the US Forest Service mascot might not approve of his aims. But, he insists, “any good conservationist can tell you that fire is an intrinsic part of the cycle of life … without regular controlled burns, a conflagration eventually occurs that wrecks the forest rather than renews it.” Saying his aim is “to inspire the New Conservative Movement to rekindle the fire of the American tradition, and to empower real Americans to take back our country”, Roberts says that despite advocating burning down the FBI, he represents “the Party of Creation” against “the Party of Destruction – those who seek to abolish the existing order in the name of emancipation, freedom, and progress”. Related: The force behind Project 2025: Kevin Roberts has the roadmap for a second Trump term Roberts’s fiery imagery and rhetoric does not end there. Elsewhere, he compares progressive policies to Dutch elm disease, with affected bodies needing to be “promptly burned”; says “the only way to revive” institutions “haggard with age, decay, and bloat, is to burn away the rot”; and even meditates on the nature of fire itself. “Man’s taming of fire is the cornerstone of human culture,” Roberts muses. “That’s the funny thing about fire. It is so fleeting, a flame flickering from moment to moment, yet in its evanescence, it is eternal. Of all the elements, fire is most associated with transformation, renewal, and change. You can’t have a blaze without some kind of sacrificial transformation of fuel into fire. Yet precisely for this reason, fire demands an attention to continuity. Unlike any of the other elements, fire dies … a fire must be continually tended.” Particularly, it seems, if it is set under the Boy Scouts of America.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs set new record with $1.36 billion combined daily inflow. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a historic inflow of $1.12 billion on Nov. 7, surpassing previous combined totals for all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This significant capital movement marks the largest single-day inflow in the history of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other major asset managers also reported notable inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC received $190.9 million, while Bitwise’s BITB increased by $13.4 million. Ark’s ARKB gained $17.6 million on the same day, according to data compiled on Nov. 7. The combined inflow hit $1.37 billion, marking the best day in spot Bitcoin ETF history since they launched in January. These inflows coincide with Bitcoin breaking the all-time high several times to a peak of $76,900, breaking previous records twice since the US presidential election on Nov. 5. The surge in Bitcoin’s price and ETF inflows suggests increased institutional interest following the election results. The ETF’s unprecedented inflow outpaced the previous combined total for all similar funds, signaling a potential shift in institutional investment strategies following Trump’s win.

Title: What Trump’s Election Really Means For Crypto?

Donald Trump pledges to make U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the Planet” at 2024 Bitcoin Conference in ... [+] Nashville. Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo. With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the crypto landscape could be on the cusp of a major transformation. Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, commitment to reforming crypto regulations, and vocal opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies suggest that U.S. crypto leadership may strengthen significantly in the coming years. Throughout his campaign, Trump has openly supported Bitcoin, aiming to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” He even proposed integrating Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy by creating a national Bitcoin reserve. This pro-Bitcoin stance aligns with Trump’s view that the U.S. should lead in digital finance. Despite years of political and regulatory challenges, the U.S. remains a powerhouse for crypto-focused businesses, driving significant economic impact. Leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pioneering tokenized funds, while VISA and Mastercard offer credit cards linked to crypto wallets, demonstrating mainstream adoption. The U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, with $4.3 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, underscores the industry’s scale. In Q2 2024 alone, stablecoins transacted $8.5 trillion—outpacing Visa’s $3.9 trillion—lead partly by U.S.-based issuers like Circle, Paxos, and PayPal. This leadership highlights the high stakes for regulatory clarity. Some major U.S. companies drive global crypto innovation despite regulatory hurdles, including ... [+] Coinbase, BlackRock, Fidelity, Mastercard, PayPal, Circle and more. Photo by Smith Collection. Under Trump, the regulatory landscape could undergo significant changes. Trump has pledged to dismantle what he views as restrictive regulations, beginning with the dismissal of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whom he blames for the “regulation by enforcement” approach. Trump could establish more straightforward, growth-oriented policies by appointing a more crypto-friendly SEC leader. Christopher Perkins, President of the New York-based crypto investment firm CoinFund, highlights the momentum, noting, “The elections in the U.S. were wildly positive for the crypto industry. While Trump has indicated he will be a crypto President, it’s important to note that 261 pro-crypto candidates were elected to Congress. This is the first ‘crypto’ Congress.” Perkins emphasizes, “We expect regulatory clarity, but not overly prescriptive regulation,” describing the outlook as “very bullish for the crypto industry—full stop.” U.S. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler at a 2023 House Financial Services Committee hearing on the lawsuits ... [+] against Binance and Coinbase. With Trump’s vow “to fire” Gensler, the focus of crypto regulation may be poised for change. Photo by Jacquelyn Martin. Trump’s opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is clearly rooted in privacy and individual freedom concerns. He supported the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC without congressional approval—a stance echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump’s anti-CBDC position could also influence global trends significantly as central banks like the European Central Bank move forward with their digital currencies. The ECB’s planned CBDC designed to provide accessible, standardized payments across the eurozone, has thus far received limited political attention in Europe, despite concerns over its potential to crowd out the private sector. However, Jonas Gross, Chairman of the Digital Euro Association, believes Trump’s vocal stance could shift this: “If Trump is outspoken against CBDCs, we may see more discussions within the European Parliament,” he suggests, indicating that Trump’s influence may prompt increased scrutiny of the ECB’s approach. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is developing a CBDC for the eurozone—a form of digital money ... [+] issued by a central bank, an approach Trump has firmly rejected. Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds. Europe has led the way in crypto regulation, with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) set to take effect by year’s end. Joachim Schwerin, Principal Economist at the European Commission, notes that Europe’s regulatory path reflects its commitment to “balanced, sustainable growth for crypto,” a stance that has already attracted leading U.S. crypto firms seeking European MiCAR licenses. While Trump’s re-election may create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S., Schwerin believes Europe’s approach will remain steady. However, he acknowledges that global competition is heating up, with nations like the Emirates and Switzerland establishing robust frameworks to attract crypto innovation. Crypto enables global transactions across borders and fosters international competition for human ... [+] capital and resources. Regulatory clarity is essential for crypto to allow innovation to flourish. Despite past regulatory challenges, the U.S. has built a strong crypto sector, with major U.S. players driving growth and innovation. Trump’s election could unlock even greater potential by establishing supportive crypto regulation. With a pro-crypto Congress and supportive regulators, the U.S. could strengthen its lead and emerge as the world’s primary hub for decentralized finance. Trump’s anti-CBDC stance may also shape global discussions, prompting central banks to reconsider centralized models. Together, these shifts could position America as a leader in digital finance, navigating a competitive landscape where Europe has already laid significant regulatory groundwork. Yet, as Rhys Bidder, Deputy Director at the Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance, observes, “There have been false dawns for crypto before... the hope must be that the industry builds in a sustainable manner.” With this new U.S. administration, crypto has a unique opportunity to prove itself as a mature and credible sector, dispelling doubts and moving beyond its volatile past.

Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 4.50%-4.75%. At the Fed's news conference, chair Jerome Powell told reporters he would not resign if requested by Donald Trump, and that Trump does not have the power to fire or demote him. Momentum behind markets U.S. markets continued advancing on Thursday, propelled by postelection momentum. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.62%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed gains to drop around 0.8% after the island's central bank reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points, in lockstep with the Fed's move. New fiscal stimulus expected from China China is expected to announce a new fiscal stimulus package when its parliament ends a five-day meeting on Friday. Analysts think the scale of support might be higher than initially planned because of Trump's threats of tariffs – that might go as high as 60% – on Chinese imports. Nissan's bad quarter Japanese automaker Nissan reported on Thursday that it made a net loss of 9.3 billion yen (around $62 million) during its fiscal second quarter. Operating profit, which is how much a company makes before taxes and other charges, plunged almost 85% year on year. Nissan also lowered its full-year outlook. Shares fell as much as 10% before recovering slightly. [PRO] Bitcoin might hit $100,000 Bitcoin surged to its highest price of more than $76,000 after Trump won the U.S election. Analysts think the cryptocurrency can climb further to reach the $100,000 milestone by the end of the year. Wednesday's postelection rally, during which the S&P popped 2.53%, was the best postelection move in the index's history, according to Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid, head of global economics and thematic research. Some of that momentum carried over to Thursday. The S&P continued its advance and gained 0.74%. Tech stocks, such as Apple, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, rose, helping the Nasdaq Composite climb 1.51% to close above 19,000 for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, petered out. The 30-stock index traded around the flatline, weighed down by losses in financial stocks. "The market is signaling that a Trump administration would be good for growth and risk assets," said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X ETFs, "but the combination of faster growth with new tariffs would be inflationary." If inflation resurfaces, the Fed's likely to stay its hand in lowering rates. That concern might be dampening investors' excitement in the stock market for now. Powell, in yesterday's press conference, maintained that "the election will have no effect on our policy decisions." Still, the Fed would be impacted by the decisions of the next administration. "Just in principle, it's possible that any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time," he said. "Forecasts of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy." Data from the CME FedWatch Tool suggests some prudence is filtering into the market. According to the futures market, just 30.4% of traders think the Fed will cut rates again in January. By contrast, 53% expect the Fed to keep rates steady. Those percentages are contingent on the central bank lowering rates to 4.25%-4.50% in December. Of course, that's all prognostication, and we know how inaccurate polls and bets can be. "By December, we'll have more data, I guess one more employer report, two more inflation reports and lots of other data," Powell said. The Fed prefers hard numbers. In markets, as in other aspects of our lives, that's probably good advice. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Lisa Kailai Han, Hakyung Kim, Jesse Pound and Alex Harring contributed to this report. This story has been updated to clarify 53% of traders expect the Fed to keep interest rates steady in January, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Got a confidential news tip?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin posted a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the digital-asset industry and promise of supportive regulations. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for about 81% of Thursday’s deluge, which came a day after the ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $1.1 billion of net subscriptions for the fund — also known as IBIT — was also unprecedented. The surging investor demand helped to push Bitcoin to another all-time high, with the original cryptocurrency rising as much as 1.7% to $77,272 on Friday. It has set fresh record highs every day since Tuesday. The demand for the world’s biggest Bitcoin fund is another sign of how Trump’s pledge to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry is reshaping the crypto market. Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of crypto exchange BTC Markets Pty, said there is a “significant risk of a feedback loop, where rising ETF inflows push Bitcoin prices higher, attracting more capital.” Much depends now on Trump following through on campaign vows, such as creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. Some technical indicators suggest a two-month rally driven by optimism about Trump’s reelection is now due for a pause. Bitcoin’s roughly 80% advance so far in 2024, partly fueled by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, exceeds the returns from traditional investments such as global stocks and gold.

IBIT pulled in a total of $1.12 billion on Thursday, beating out its prior October 30 record of $872 million, data from SoSoValue shows. The fund, which has emerged as a dominant force among its 10 other rivals, has a net asset value of $34.2 billion, bolstered by Bitcoin’s heightened value. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust US data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Investor interest in the world's largest crypto is at an all-time high, which has driven record-setting heights for the asset, above $76,870, amid surging activity among altcoins and meme coins. “The ETFs are accumulating Bitcoin faster than it can be created by a factor of two to one,” Hundal added. “Sooner or later, this will tip across into a broad-based crypto rally. Probably sooner.” It comes as IBIT posted a record $4 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, vastly exceeding its nearest rival, Fidelity, after President-elect Donald Trump secured a second term as the 47th president of the United States. Trump’s Whitehouse win is viewed by many in the industry as a boon for digital assets. He has promised to protect crypto mining interests, establish a Bitcoin reserve, and usher in favorable policy. The ascent of IBIT as a top Bitcoin ETF comes amid shifting sentiment over investments in institutionalized crypto. The fund has maintained steady inflows since inception, while competitor Grayscale's GBTC—the second largest by net assets at $16.8 billion—has faced negative outflows due to its high fees. BlackRock charges a 0.25% fee, waived until January, while GBTC charges significantly higher at 1.5%. Fidelity’s FBTC, meanwhile, also charges 0.25%, though its waiver ended in July.

Title: Róisín Ingle on Kathleen Watkins: ‘We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman’

Full Content:
It’s a blustery Dublin day and I’m cycling northside, thinking of Kathleen Watkins. I’m thinking about her elegance and sense of fun and the conversation that flowed from her like music. She died on Thursday having turned 90 last month. She was let out of the hospital especially for that celebration which, I have it on good authority, included afternoon tea and champagne. Our paths had crossed over the years through her late husband, the legendary broadcaster Gay Byrne, and at children’s concerts around town. Her beloved grandchildren and my daughters attended the same music school. I used to look forward to watching her in the audience, wearing a brightly coloured scarf and even brighter lipstick, the proudest, most besotted of grandmothers, lost in the music. But I knew her by reputation long before any of that. Kathleen Watkins, a woman who kept her own surname after marriage back when that was an eyebrow-raising decision, was something of a star past-pupil of my secondary school. She played the harp at Sion Hill in Blackrock, Co Dublin, and later went on to become the first continuity announcer at RTÉ. I’m sad but I’m smiling as I cycle home having just heard the news that she’s gone. There was always fun to be had with Kathleen. Things were “marvellous”, people were “darling”, food was “just divine” and memorable happenings were “the greatest times of my life”. She was one of the most enthusiastic people I’ve ever met. Arranging a lunch a couple of years ago, she texted a string of red wine emojis in anticipation. A mutual friend was celebrating her 70th birthday. “Oh, to be so young,” she texted. She was about to turn 88 herself by that stage. At lunch she was full of stories and plans and endless, fascinating conversation that covered art and music and theatre and family. There were stories of holidays in Donegal where she and Gay palled around with Brian and Anne Friel. My daughters arrived towards the end of the lunch and under pressure from their pushy mother one of them reluctantly recited a poem she’d written. (Well, you try reading your teenage rhymes to a table of adults that included poetry curator Kathleen Watkins and author Marie Heaney, wife of Nobel laureate Seamus.) One of the many great things about Kathleen was that she knew she’d had a wonderful life and she appreciated it deeply. As wife of the host of The Late Late Show she was Gay’s plus-one to glittering events and first-nights, many of which were arts-related, which suited both their interests. Neither of them were party people but they loved cultural goings-on of all kinds. It was “a charmed life”, she would say. “God is too good to me”. It was a more challenging life after losing Gay, who died almost exactly five years ago. They would have been 60 years married last June. She was full of the memories of their partnership. She loved “his sense of humour, the unexpected off-the-cuff quip, he was so smart”. She told me about the way he’d compliment her, noticing a well-tailored new suit she’d bought, saying “well done, Kaysie”. (He called her Kay or Kaysie, never Kathleen and she called him Gabsie. She was Nana Kit to her grandchildren and she answered to nothing else). She told me she missed Gay dreadfully. “But then I’m very spoiled,” she said of having her two daughters Suzy and Crona close by. As well as being endlessly interested in the arts, in music and in poetry, Kathleen was also a massive reader and rugby fan; she finished reading Johnny Sexton’s autobiography Obsessed last week. She’d often watch Sky Arts at 6am in the morning, entranced by ballet productions or concerts live from the Sydney Opera House. A mutual friend remembers going to annual lunches in her and Gay’s apartment in Sandymount, where they’d host his old Late Late Show production team. There were several sketches of Kathleen by Seán Keating hung in the hall, he remembers. Keating was a struggling artist when they were made. Kathleen would sit for him in his lodgings, which had a single bar electric heater, and pay for the drawings, a way of supporting the artist financially without making him feel embarrassed. It’s astonishing to think she began a career as a children’s author in her eighties, with the Pigín books. She was also involved in a number of poetry podcasts. I interviewed her four years ago around the publication of her book One For Everyone, a collection of her favourite poems. I admired how she was never “high falutin’” about poetry. “I’m not a bit like that. I feel poetry is for everybody.” She was particularly fond of a poem called Love After Love by Derek Walcott, she said it spoke to everyone. What did it say to her? “Well, sometimes you put yourself on the back burner. So take time, be at peace, be calm, look and see who you are. Who you were. Things are good aren’t they? They could be worse. Feast on your life, the poem says. That’s important. I was always a glass pretty full person.” There were three poems by the late Derek Mahon in the book, which was dedicated to her late husband with a simple “For Gay”. The final poem in the book, Everything Is Going to be Alright, was the one she believed Byrne would have liked the best and one that gave her comfort as she navigated life without him. “There will be dying, there will be dying, but there is no need to get into that ... Everything is going to be all right.” We’d been texting regularly in recent months, trying to make plans to meet up “for a chat and a cuppa” – we didn’t get around to it and I am now very sad and sorry about that. Still, we were in touch as she managed visits and stays in the Blackrock Clinic where she told me she watched the racing in Cheltenham – “it helps to pass the time”. [ Kathleen Watkins: ‘Occasionally I find myself talking to Gay in my head’Opens in new window ] We exchanged war stories, she was always putting a positive spin on even the worst events. She had suffered a few ailments and she texted one day: “a hip problem and two mini-strokes. Never knew they happened. Feeling good”. I told her some of my own troubles. “Lotsa love, K,” she wrote in reply, with some encouraging words that lifted my spirits at a dark time. She was a great one for prayers, “not a holy joe” she clarified to me once, but she was a woman who loved a good Mass. She credited her longevity to “genes and the luck of the draw”. Kathleen had so many poems in her head right until the end, her memory sharp, recalling the words she held dear. She once told me that Gay loved her to recite Beannacht by John O’Donohoe. That poem contains these lines: “When the canvas frays/ In the currach of thought/ And a stain of ocean/ Blackens beneath you,/ May there come across the waters,/ A path of yellow moonlight,/ To bring you safely home.” Lotsa love to you, Kathleen. We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman. Safe home. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Poulet Bonne Femme takeaway review: Delicious and succulent roast chicken with all the trimmings

Husband and wife team Gavin McCarthy and Sara Mitchell launched Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire’s farmers’ market in 2009. Laid off in the 2008 recession, with a newborn son and no interest in emigrating, they gambled Gavin’s redundancy on a rotisserie trailer. At first, they sold roast dinners; the sandwiches came later. With a commitment to high-quality Irish food, Poulet Bonne Femme sources free-range chickens from local farms and makes everything in-store daily. The focus is on family meals – rotisserie chicken, honey roast ham, pork with crackling, and roast Irish beef. Sides are all home-made, from roast potatoes to coleslaw, designed for easy midweek meals and the ultimate Sunday roast. Worth noting is the fact that they are also doing pre-prepared dinners for Christmas, which come with the full works: boned and rolled turkey, honey ham, and every side you’d expect. There are six concessions in Avoca stores around Ireland and there are two stand-alone stores – Blackrock and most recently, Dún Laoghaire, where there is also an area for sit-in. Rotisserie roast chicken, roast potatoes, roast root vegetables, stuffing and gravy. Very pleasant. I rang the Dún Laoghaire shop to check on availability and placed my order on the phone. I picked it up that evening. The rotisserie chicken was absolutely delicious. The skin was crisp and golden with a tasty savoury flavour. The wings were crispy and the leg and breast meat was succulent. The roast potatoes are baby potatoes with skins on, so not quite the crunchy delight you get with conventional roast potatoes. The root vegetables – mainly parsnip and carrots – were very good. The bread stuffing was loose, so needed to be moistened with melted butter, but there was a good taste of herbs running through it. The gravy was a bit muted and was improved by punching up the seasoning and adding a splash of wine and squeeze of lemon juice. Everything except the gravy (plastic container) was packed in paper or those round cardboard cartons we now associate with lockdown meal kits. So crushable and recyclable. €39.05 for dinner for four people: Rotisserie roast chicken, €15.95; roast potatoes, €6.95; roast root vegetables, €6.95; stuffing, €5.25; and gravy, €3.95. Open 9am-6pm in Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock. Sundays are a busy day so call ahead to order. Concessions serve from 10am to 5pm or 6pm. Email catering@poueltbonnefemme.com Yes, this is really good chicken and I love the fact that it’s free-range. Ordering the sides means you have a night off cooking.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $52.3M Inflows as U.S. Election Sparks Crypto Market Gains

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. The U.S. spot Ether ETFs experienced a significant boost in inflows just after the U.S. presidential election. The Total inflows for the nine Ethereum ETFs hit $52.3 million. According to data from Farside Investors, this was the largest inflow the Ether-based ETFs had seen in six weeks. The recent inflow is Ethereum’s best performance since late September. The inflow coincided with a 10% price increase in Ethereum, pushing the price of ETH to an intraday high of $2,872, the highest since early August. While $52.3 million may seem small compared to inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, it was a big win for Ethereum investors. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw a whopping $622 million in inflows on the same day. According to the data, the inflows were primarily driven by the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust. Fidelity’s fund attracted the largest share, pulling in $26.9 million. Grayscale followed closely behind with $25.4 million. However, the remaining seven spot Ether ETFs reported zero inflows, leaving a mixed picture for the overall Ether ETF market. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, a leading Ethereum ETF, reported no daily net flows. This stood out as BlackRock is one of the biggest names in the market, and its lack of inflows surprised many. Despite no new funds entering BlackRock’s ETF, investor interest in Ether ETFs remained strong. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has faced significant challenges since its conversion to spot Ether ETF in July. The fund has witnessed more outflows than inflows, with large chunks of capital exiting it daily. Some believe its high fee could be the reason for such occurrence. Since July, Grayscale has seen its assets under management shrink by $3.1 billion. This has contributed to a net outflow of $490 million across all Ethereum ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs maintain dominance over the crypto ETF market, with daily flows significantly exceeding that of Ether ETFs. According to Farside Investor, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive inflow of $621.9 million. This marked a reversal in the trend, as the ETFs had seen three consecutive days of outflows before the election. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led the inflows, recording $308.8 million, its largest inflow since June. Several other Bitcoin ETFs also performed well, with Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, and Grayscale all seeing inflows exceeding $100 million each. However, not every Bitcoin ETF had a positive day. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reported outflows for the second consecutive day. IBIT lost $69.1 million in net outflows, according to preliminary data. Despite this, November 6 was BlackRock’s highest volume day, with $4.1 billion traded. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips. Subscribe now!

Title: RICHARD PORTER: Trump Was A Better President Than Biden And A Better Candidate Than Harris

Time Published: 2024-11-08T03:11:49Z
Full Content:
It’s a comeback story for the ages: Despite two impeachments, two assassination attempts, four criminal indictments, 34 felony convictions, and coverage from the big three networks that was 85% negative (as opposed to 78% positive for his opponent), former President Donald Trump triumphed over all the hate and the haters to win his second term in the Oval Office. Why? Trump was a better president than President Joe Biden and a better candidate than Vice President Kamala Harris. Ordinary Americans enjoyed measurably more fruitful lives under Trump than Biden. And Trump is noticeably more authentic, relatable, charming, clever, convincing, insightful, intuitive and fun than Harris. Trump won on both policy and personality. Democracy prevailed; the people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America — media, academia, and big business, too — not just opposing him but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. Oh, and the movie and rock stars, too. Harrison Ford movingly told us over the weekend that he voted for Harris and Tim Walz. The core of his pitch was that “these two people believe in the rule of law; they believe in science; they believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans. They believe that we are in this together… Look, I’m frustrated about a lot of things in this country, I’m sure you are, too. But the other guy? He spent four years turning us against each other, while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.” It is a passionate pitch, but it fell flat because most of us didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. For those of us who are frustrated about what the government has been doing, it’s merely a beautifully narrated lie. It was a call to trust the prosecutors and the judges who cynically used the courts as a partisan weapon while braying about their fealty to the “rule of law.” To believe government bureaucrats who silenced those who dared to question the origins and effects of COVID-19 — and were later proven right. To ignore the dishonesty of national security officials who claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake even though they knew it wasn’t. To forget that they ran for office claiming that they wanted to unite the country while working full-time to divide it — solely for the purpose of winning elections. We didn’t go along. So, Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story, it’s a vote of “no-confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core mission. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. During his first trip overseas as president, Biden addressed the U.S. troops stationed in England. It wasn’t an auspicious beginning. “When I first was elected vice president with President Obama, the military sat us down to let us know what the greatest threats facing America were,” he said. “This is not a joke: you know what the Joint Chiefs told us the greatest threat facing America was? Global warming.” Despite the disclaimer, a “joke” was exactly what this sounded like. Or, rather, a spoof of liberal excess. Biden was addressing men and women who had signed up to risk their lives on the battlefield to protect their fellow Americans. And he was giving them Democratic Party talking points. The obvious inference to be drawn is that the new commander in chief was in over his head and that the Pentagon is run by suck-ups or idiots. Both perceptions were reinforced soon thereafter, a few months later, by the United States’ disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. When a military focuses on something other than fighting wars, it is on the road to failure. Similarly, nearly all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. The Securities and Exchange Commission is tasked with facilitating capital formation and discouraging fraud, not suppressing carbon emissions. FEMA’s core mission is to swiftly respond to and remediate disasters, not to find taxpayer-funded housing for illegal immigrants. The FBI’s core mission is to protect citizens from crime and terrorism, not from conservative Catholics. And it is not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. If the information being conveyed does not reflect observable reality, then the press has failed in its core mission. Think of the memorable scenes of 2020 when cable news reporters would describe “mostly peaceful protests” while fires ravaged buildings behind them. The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated on campus today? Nor are once venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into C-Suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers. Just as government, media, and business institutions have been degraded by being politicized, so, too, have public “experts.” Socrates, perhaps the greatest-ever expert on knowledge, observed that the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. He refused to use his expertise authoritatively, but instead, he used his expertise to empower others to think through problems. While few voters read Socrates today, almost everyone knows that experts don’t always agree. That is why when we encounter difficult or expensive problems, we shop for second opinions. Whether it is auto repair or brain surgery, we know it makes sense to get a second and sometimes a third opinion. Why? Experts have different perspectives and different motivations. Often, there is not one answer. We may ultimately rely on an expert’s judgment, but not without using their expertise to understand the problem in order to make a better decision ourselves. Public experts tend to be more authoritative and less advisory, which undermines faith in experts generally. For example, during the COVID pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the team of government experts used their “expert” status authoritatively and politically. This lack of Socratic modesty caused millions to lose faith in all public experts who behave in a similar manner. So, in a world in which so much is going wrong, electing the guy who drives all those pontificators nuts just makes sense. A working majority of the American people were convinced that, despite (or perhaps because of) all the hate they attract, Trump and his merry band of bold critics — including former Democrats Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard — are the best bet for purging the system in order to make America great again.

Bengaluru-headquartered United Breweries Limited (UBL), part of the HEINEKEN company, has announced the launch of its premium beer brand, Amstel Grande in India, starting with the Maharashtra market. We view this change of leadership as pro USA but not that positive for rest of world. Based on policies that Donald Trump has communicated like corporate and individual tax cuts, import restriction and action against illegal immigrants, if implemented, will definitely be pro growth and employment for US. For India, IT and other export oriented sectors like textiles, auto ancillary etc will tend to benefit. However sanctions and tafiffs on imports from rest of the world may hurt global growth and eventually lead to higher inflation on back of shortage of good and services. Also to combat the same China may announce large stimulus further fuelling inflation restricting FED from cutting rates. So broadly, we believe policies are self-offsetting to some extent and needs to be seen what gets implemented.

Swiggy remained optimistic of growth in quick commerce amid growing competition from deep pocket players and said it has grown amid intense competition over the past decade, an official said on Thursday. In an interview to PTI, CEO Food of Swiggy, Rohit Kapoor, acknowledged the possibility of the entry of Jio into the hyperlocal delivery market as a competitor, but underscored that building a successful business in this sector requires more than just capital. Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with. Beyond talent, a deep understanding of the Indian consumer – something we’ve developed over a decade of experience in kitchens across the country – is essential,” Kapoor said. Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent. Swiggy has hit the Rs 11,327 crore IPO comprising fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,499 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 6,828 crore. The shares will be available for subscription in the price range of Rs 371 to Rs 390 apiece. The company plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue for investing in technology and cloud infrastructure; brand marketing and business promotion; debt payment; and funds will also be allocated for inorganic growth and general corporate purposes.

Read more Gold price rally to continue as we advance into a low-rate era “Gold prices in the international market rallied over 1% to trade over the $2710 level. The move is primarily due to the 25 bps rate cut announced by the US Fed last night. The rate cut led to a cooloff in DXY and subsequently a rally in gold. The yellow has recovered much of the fall witnessed earlier this week. Gold prices normally tend to rise in a low-interest regime. We are currently in a low-interest regime, post two straight cuts announced by the US Fed, and the RBI is expected to cut rates next month. Thereby fuelling the rally in gold further. As we are expected to be in a lower for longer interest rate regime, gold prices are expected to stay elevated. The geopolitical tensions are expected to support the yellow metal further. We reiterate our view on the gold price trajectory. In the long term, gold prices will touch $3000 globally, and Rs 86,000 in the domestic markets.” Track live updates here Sensex opened at 79,611.90, up from its previous close of 79,541.79, and is currently at 79,577.86, reflecting a slight increase of 36.07 points or 0.05 per cent.

Gold prices edged higher, rebounding after the previous session’s steep losses amidst rate cut expectations from the Fed and reassessed the potential for geopolitical tensions during Donald Trump presidency. Bullions had notched up a series of record highs in the run-up to the elections, but tumbled more than 3% after Trump’s victory, on the back of dollar rally to four-month highs. Quick conclusion to a hotly contested presidential election also cleared a key point of uncertainty for global financial markets, triggering a risk-on rally across the board, while pressuring safe-haven assets such as gold. Trump ran a campaign vowing to increase trade tariffs on China, which could trigger a renewed trade war between the world’s biggest economies. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point as its chair Jay Powell hailed the strength of the US economy and said he would not resign if incoming president Donald Trump asked him to. Focus now shifts to Michigan consumer sentiment and updates regarding China legislative congress meet. Domestic markets are expected to open on a flat note despite the US Fed rate cut. The US Federal Reserve has reduced the interest rate by another 25 bps to 4.50-4.75 per cent, triggering a sharp rally in the already surcharged S&P 500 and Nasdaq that lifted them to new all-time highs.

FOMC cut its target rate by 25 bps, as expected, to 4.5-4.75% 2. The decision to cut rates was unanimous 3. The post-meeting statement had no real meaningful changes. 4. FOMC statement continues to note that the risks to inflation & employment are roughly in balance, and most importantly continues to provide the same noncommittal guidance that “in considering additional adjustments” to the funds rate the FOMC will be data dependent 5. Chair Powell’s comments at today’s FOMC meeting were on balance dovish: he expressed confidence that inflation & inflationary drivers were well-behaved, saw further cooling in the labor market as unwelcome, and endorsed a plan to gradually ease back toward neutral 6. Chair Powell said a pick-up in inflation could cause the Fed to slow rate cuts as policy rates approach neutral. But that is not the scenario that Powell sees as likely. Instead, he rhetorically asked “Where is the inflation coming from?” and stated ‘the economy is not tight’ 7. Chair Powell was asked multiple times about his interpretation of the rise in treasury yields & whether it might affect Fed policy. He responded that the move has not been sustained long enough for officials to react to 8. When questioned if he would resign if asked by Trump, he said ‘No’ 9. When asked if he’d be legally required to leave, he had another simple one-word answer ‘No’ 10. In addition to being asked whether he would leave, Powell fielded several questions about the election and potential policies of the incoming administration, all of which he avoided giving direct answers Shyam Metalics and Energy Ltd (SMEL), a leading multi-metal conglomerate with footprints in carbon steel, stainless steel, speciality alloys and aluminium foil along with a captive power plant announced its Financial Results for the quarter ended 30th September 2024.

These stocks have been meticulously filtered through our proprietary “AQCG” model, ensuring a rigorous analysis. Investment thesis: ~ We initiate coverage on Polyplex Corporation (PPC) with a BUY rating and TP of Rs 2,464 (valued at 12.0x FY27E EPS). We believe that this less known and under-owned business has all the right ingredients for re-rating and is poised for accelerated growth on the back of: i) increasing share of margin accretive value-added/D-PAC sales, ii) Rising commodity spreads, iii) Strategic acquisition by Al Ghurair group bringing in synergy gains. ~ PPC is the only global packaging company having resin plants at all manufacturing locations. This integration optimizes the supply chain, reduces costs, and accelerates time to market new products. The company focuses on creating an innovative, highly customized, and differentiated products, forming a portfolio of value-added offerings, and differentiated products, applications, and customers (D-PAC) that preserves profitability. ~ The demand-supply mismatch has started to narrow given the robust demand in domestic and global markets. This coupled with limited capacity addition, we believe will aid in spreads bottoming out. We expect the BOPET commodity spread to normalize at Rs 40-45 per kg over H2FY25-26E. ~ With Al Ghurair group capacity of over 500k metric tons per annum (MTPA) mirroring PPC’s capacity, the combined entity is set to set to become one of the largest players in the entire packaging space (BOPP and BOPET combined), offering immense growth potential. ~ Comfortable balance sheet positioning, robust CUF, synergies via a strategic promoter, we see revenue / earnings be on an upward trajectory. We value the business at 12.0x its FY27E estimates, to arrive at a TP of Rs 2,464 and initiate with a BUY . Our BULL/BEAR case scenario suggests a TP of Rs 3,288/1,020.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI.

Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story.

But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move.

Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond.

There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry.

Title: Justices skeptical about Facebook’s data breach disclosure to investors
URL: https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/11/justices-skeptical-about-facebooks-data-breach-disclosure-to-investors/
Time Published: 2024-11-07T17:12:07Z
Full Content:
The justices heard arguments Wednesday in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, their first securities case of the year. The case involves the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach, and considers whether Facebook’s disclosures to investors before the breach was public improperly downplayed the risks that data breaches posed to the company and its stock price. Shareholders sued Facebook in 2018 after they learned that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the personal data of 30 million Facebook users. The shareholders conted that Facebook misled them about the risks to their investment. Although some justices seemed more receptive to the argument of Kannon Shanmugam (representing Facebook), the dominant tone was skepticism. The headwinds started in the first minutes of the argument, with Justice Clarence Thomas offering an off-hand assessment that “a reasonable person” would assume from a statement like Facebook’s that nothing bad of this sort ever had happened to it. Shanmugam quickly faced similar perspectives from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who compared Facebook’s disclosures to a homeowner suggesting that crime might be a risk to values in the future without mentioning a string of recent burglaries in the neighborhood. To the casual observer, there are not a lot of five-justice majorities that skip over those three justices. That’s not to say that it was all bad for Facebook. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were the most reluctant to accept this as enough to justify a class action against Facebook. For Roberts, Facebook’s disclosure was more like a statement that you should be careful about walking down his front steps, because you might fall – a statement from which you might infer that somebody had fallen in the past. For him, the subjectivity of determining what a factfinder might infer from any particular disclosure made it “kind of a blank check” to “go to trial to decide” how to interpret the disclosure. In the same vein, Kavanaugh thought it central that the Securities and Exchange Commission already has rules that require companies explicitly to disclose lots of adverse past events in various disclosures – and this is not on the list. For him, it makes no sense for “the judiciary … to walk the plank on this … when the SEC could do it.” As he put it, “[t]he SEC knows how to write regulations that require disclosure of past events. … Why not let the SEC do this if they want to?” Past experience suggests it is hard to imagine a unanimous Supreme Court affirming a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit expanding liability under the securities laws, so I certainly would not want to overread the argument. What I would say is this was not a compelling day for Meta. We’ll have to wait for the opinions in the spring to see what they actually decide.

Title: Stock market today: Fed cuts rates, Nasdaq surges as Nvidia and Amazon lead tech rally

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions. Read more here. The stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains. "Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a sixth consecutive week, following Treasury yields as they climbed higher through the presidential election. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs. Read more here. About 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business. For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here. Initial jobless claims jumped to 221,000 last week, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday morning. The previous week's level was revised up by 2,000 from 216,000 to 218,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims came in at 1,892,000, an increase of 39,000 from the previous week's revised level. Here's a look at the big economic and market themes happening today as Wall Street adjusts to Donald Trump's coming return to the White House. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points today, aiming for stability and avoiding surprises following Trump's victory in the election.

Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs.

For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions. Read more here. The stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains. "Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.

It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here. Initial jobless claims jumped to 221,000 last week, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday morning. The previous week's level was revised up by 2,000 from 216,000 to 218,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims came in at 1,892,000, an increase of 39,000 from the previous week's revised level. Here's a look at the big economic and market themes happening today as Wall Street adjusts to Donald Trump's coming return to the White House.

Title: Good Morning, News: Keith Wilson is Mayor-Elect, Bernie Offers Harsh (But True) Feedback for Dems, and Lame Ducks Gonzalez and Mapps Don't Wanna Work Anymore

If you’re reading this, you probably know the value of the Mercury’s news reporting, arts and culture coverage, event calendar, and the bevy of events we host throughout the year. The work we do helps our city shine, but we can’t do it without your support. If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support! Good morning, Portland. I need to keep it real with you—I'm not doing too hot on an emotional level. I know I'm not alone in that feeling. But it's going to be 60 degrees and sunny out today (ahead of cold and rain for days to come) so I recommend going outside, taking a walk, trying to breathe. Now, am I going to do that? HELL NO! Just as your elementary school teachers lived in the school, I live in the computer and I cannot get out, even when it would serve me and others to do so. Okay, fine—I will try to take a short walk today. But you have to, too. I'm going to stop talking to myself now because I know what you came here for was the NEWS, not little platitudes about self-care. But, I mean, we should take care of ourselves. IN LOCAL NEWS: • THE SECOND ROUND OF CITY COUNCIL RESULTS ARE IN...and nothing has changed. Well, okay, the candidates who were leading on election night are still in good positions to win, though Multnomah County has more than 100,000 ballots left to count (and more are likely en route to the Elections Office). Right now, it's looking like there's going to be a pretty solid progressive majority on City Council, with candidates Tiffany Koyama Lane and Mitch Green (both endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America) in good positions to win a seat. Other notable progressive candidates in the top three of their districts include Candace Avalos (D1), Sameer Kanal (D2), and Angelita Morillo (D3). This evening's drop should bring a bit more certainty, but there's good reason for optimism. Business poured a ton of money into these races and money was unable to compete with community, a strong ground game, and the literal power of love and friendship (yes I’m talking about me and Tiffany 😂) BUT! I buried the lede here, because we do know one thing: Keith Wilson is going to be Portland's next mayor. Current Mayor Ted Wheeler posted his congratulations on social media, and mayoral candidate Rene Gonzalez said he conceded the race. We ranked Wilson second on our list of endorsements, and his win is a pretty resounding disapproval of our current City Council members, three of whom ran mayoral campaigns of their own. Also...our city sure has a type. • Commissioners Rene Gonzelez, Mingus Mapps, and Dan Ryan have dropped their controversial, expensive plan to terminate the city's homeless services agreement with Multnomah County. Why? Well, as much as I'd like to think common sense prevailed, it seems more likely that Gonzalez and Mapps are just not in the mood for political stunts following their poor showing in Tuesday's mayoral election. The trio pulled the agenda item to consider terminating the joint homeless response agreement a little more than 24 hours before it was set to be considered by Council today. And folks, this is a win! Terminating the Homelessness Response Services Intergovernmental Agreement between the city of Portland and Multnomah County would've cost about $40 million in cold hard cash and even more in wasted energy and political capital. Plus, with the intergovernmental agreement dissolution off the table, it's official: Gonzalez really did not do ANYTHING during his short time in Portland City Hall. (And I feel confident saying he will not be productive in his lame duck period.) No matter what happens with the new City Council, it's only uphill from here. Last night was a repudiation of this kind of politics. Good to pull it as 2/3 of its sponsors will not even be on the next council. I'm calling on council to also pull the Clean and Safe ESD vote from next week's agenda. Let the next council take that up. https://t.co/I0e6DXbDCB • If you're looking for some non-election related news, our Corbin Smith has you covered with a wonderful recap and stunning photos from the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) Global Championship this past weekend, where Portland's roller derby squad won the day. Smith says the roller derby championship was "sports. Major sports." So READ ALL ABOUT IT RIGHT HERE. • There's really not much local news available right now that's not related to the election (which is fair and good and obviously important but I figure you guys might want to read about something else for a second of your day). But there is this: Intel is bringing back free coffee and tea for employees. This was an employee benefit it slashed during budget cuts last summer, but in an attempt to improve employee morale, it's back. The chipmaker is currently doing layoffs at its Oregon facility and has cut other, more important employee benefits that will likely not return, but I guess a cost-benefit analysis showed saving money on coffee wasn't worth the fight. If Mike Rogoway at the Oregonian deems it important, who am I to disagree? (That wasn't sarcasm, Rogoway's a great reporter.) IN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS: • The country is reacting to the news of a second Trump presidency, and there are obviously some different takes. I took note of a few notable perspectives during the rare moments when I was able to make the outrageously difficult effort to lift my head from my pillow yesterday. Senator Bernie Sanders (of "Bernie would've won" fame) probably said it best, IMO. Sanders wrote in a statement yesterday that "It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change." He also acknowledged the futility of asking the "big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party" to "learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign." A post shared by Bernie Sanders (@berniesanders) "Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not," Sanders wrote. DAMN. That's harsh but real. I hope others will join Bernie in calling on the Democratic Party to meet the moment instead of handing their ass to the increasingly fascistic Republicans. I do believe the election results also need to fall on the MAGA fools who have sold their soul to the devil in exchange for the promise of cheaper gas, but we aren't going to win by further alienating the working class. The Democrats better start bringing something to the table, or it'll be even more Joever than it is right now. • Among the MANY deep concerns I have about Trump's reelection, the climate crisis ranks at the top. Trump is a known climate denier and has stated his desire to boost oil production, get rid of subsidies for electric cars, and overall do a bunch of damage to any small amount of progress we've been able to make on the climate crisis in the last four years. So I'm freaking out, because this issue isn't exactly something we have time to fuck around on. Something that made me feel a bit better: Clean energy analysts and activists say though a second Trump administration will make it harder to transition to renewable and clean energy, it won't make it impossible. The market has already embraced clean energy for its financial benefits and the economic devastation that climate change is and will continue to cause. And that's not changing. (Obviously, the free market is not going to solve the climate crisis, but that reality would remain the same under any capitalist president.) Also, there are a lot of climate activists and scientists and lawyers who are a lot smarter than I am and already planning their resistance to Trump's inevitably horrible policies. If you, too, are deeply worried about climate action under Trump, consider supporting or joining an environmental organization or law group. Also, ride your bike more. Even if it won't solve the climate crisis on its own, it'll make you feel a little better. A post shared by NRDC (@nrdc_org) Now, topic change needed for my sanity. Sorry. • A federal labor judge ruled Amazon workers in Alabama should get a third chance to vote on unionizing. The first time warehouse workers at a facility in Bessemer voted about unionizing in 2021, they voted no, but labor officials ruled that Amazon influenced the vote and the result shouldn't be expected. Workers voted again in 2022, but the election was too close to call and has remained in limbo. Now, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has ordered a third election. But Amazon, AKA Union Busters R US, will surely contest the decision and continue to stomp union activity wherever it can. And under a Trump NLBR...ugh. The doom is creeping in. Sorry. Just here to report the news. • There's a major wildfire in Southern California, just northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuation orders for more than 10,000 people. Powerful winds are fanning the flames and the fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and blanketed neighborhoods in smoke. Hoping for more favorable fire-fighting conditions soon. • Finally, there's this. Happy Thursday. TTYL. Many people will continue struggling to come to terms with the election results, but there’s still a lot you can do:1) Be irritable at work2) Withdraw from people who love you/need you3) Make an impulsive and self destructive major life decision Taylor Griggs is Portland Mercury's news reporter.

Title: What’s really behind Big Tech’s return-to-office mandates?
URL: https://www.theverge.com/24290345/return-to-office-mandates-amazon-productivity-remote-work-hybrid-decoder-podcast
Time Published: 2024-11-07T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. On this week’s episode of Decoder, we’re talking about work. Specifically, where we work, how our expectations of working remotely were radically changed by the covid-19 pandemic, and how those expectations feel like they’re on the verge of changing yet again. For many people, the pendulum has swung wildly between working fully remote and now a push to return to the office from their bosses, and there are a lot of theories about what might be motivating big companies to try and bring everyone back. Here on Decoder, I’ve talked to lots of CEOs about the benefits of working fully remote versus hybrid or having everybody back in the office over the past several years, and I’ve heard the full spectrum of responses. Some executives are adamant that people need to be in the office, and others are equally adamant that fully remote is the way to go. We’ll play some of those answers for you as we go so you can get a sense of the enormous range of opinions here. If you look at the surveys, it’s basically 50/50 — quite a lot of people want to work remotely, and they can be pretty loud online. But there are a lot of people, who are often quieter, who want to go back to the office for pretty good reasons. Some folks just don’t have the space to work from home, or they’re simply tired of making video calls in sweatpants all day and never really leaving the house. I know some people who really like just being able to leave work at the office when they head home for the day, and I’ve heard from a lot of younger people who are struggling to get face time with the more senior and experienced people at their companies in order to build relationships and grow their networks. The messy middle of all this is what quite a few companies have settled on: hybrid work, which allows for a combination of in-office and remote work. This is how The Verge runs, and I quite like it — but it’s not perfect. Like so many people who work in a hybrid environment, there are days where I go into a mostly empty office and then sit on Zoom in a phone booth, and there are days when I realize I’m the only one in a meeting sitting at home because everyone else has gone into the office. Figuring out how to make hybrid work is a long-term cultural project that we really only started in 2020. While there are some obvious benefits, it’s not clear if anyone’s really cracked it in a way that scales across different kinds of companies. Now, some companies have decided the nuance just isn’t worth it. In September, Amazon mandated that all employees would return to an office five days a week starting in January. In the memo announcing the change, CEO Andy Jassy argued that the company had “observed that it’s easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” that “collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective,” and that “teams tend to be better connected to one another” when everyone is in the office. Amazon isn’t alone in wanting employees back at their desks. Companies like Disney and Salesforce have also pushed for employees to come back to the office at least four days a week, making similar arguments. Other companies, like Apple, have been steadily pressuring workers to come back for quite some time — that beautiful new spaceship office in Cupertino wasn’t built to stay empty. But is the return to office really about building company culture and being more creative and productive? I have to tell you, there is a huge chunk of The Verge and Decoder audience that is absolutely convinced that any big return-to-office policy change is actually just a layoff in disguise — we get emails making this case virtually every time one of these moves is announced. Jassy even addressed this directly, just a few days ago, in an all-hands meeting. Responding to claims that the return-to-work mandate is a quote “backdoor layoff,” he told employees that that is simply not true. We’ll come back to that later on. So I wanted to know what’s been going on, what the real reasons behind return-to-office might be, and where this is all headed next. To explain it, I caught up with two experts on the subject: Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School, and Jessica Kriegel, the chief strategy officer at workplace culture consultancy Culture Partners. We dive into what’s been happening to the nature of work today, and you’ll hear both of them lay out some of the key reasons behind the return-to-office push. We also try to figure out whether Amazon is just an outlier or, as you’ll hear Jessica say, “the tip of the spear” in what could be something much bigger. Here are some of the news stories, surveys, and studies we discussed in this episode, if you’d like to learn more: / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Thursday, eyeing a return to the Trump rally as investors mapped out the next president's likely impact on markets and awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1%, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.7%. Spirits still appear buoyant after Donald Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. But some on Wall Street see signs of a relief rally, given Trump's decisive victory also put paid to worries about a contested vote. They suggest stock gains could slow as the euphoria fades. The Fed's interest-rate decision later Thursday — typically, a dominant event for markets — is taking something of a back seat amid the election fallout. For one thing, investors see a 25 basis point rate cut as pretty much a sure thing at the end of policymakers' two-day meeting. Instead, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock fell as the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. By contrast, peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares jumped more than 4% after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits in early trading.

Title: The world’s best gaming CPU launches today – here’s where to find the 9800X3D

Enthusiasts take note; the new best CPU for gaming is out, but it's selling fast. Here's what you need to know. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The much-anticipated Ryzen 7 9800X3D has officially launched following months of rumors and speculation. It comes on the heels of AMD's standard Ryzen 9000 desktop chips, released in August 2024, which Senior Editor Ben Wilson favorably reviewed. Wilson also reviewed the new Ryzen 7 9800X3D, calling it "the best gaming CPU" and handing it a Windows Central Best Award. That's despite a higher launch price (by $30) than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor, which is still available today. I'm still expecting to see more Ryzen 9000 X3D chips to launch in the future, but I'd be surprised if the 9800X3D doesn't remain the most popular choice for gamers for a long time. November 8, 9:10 AM EST: The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is back in stock at Amazon but remains unavailable at Newegg, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. Pre-built custom PCs featuring the chip are still available; details below. — Ben Wilson AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D AMD's new $479 Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers a second-gen 3D V-Cache that pushes gaming performance beyond even the stellar Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor. If you want the absolute best processor for PC gaming, there's really no other option. 👉 Available at: Best Buy | Newegg | Amazon | B&H It shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who's been following the latest Zen 5 rumors that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has surpassed its predecessor to become the best new CPU for PC gamers. Senior Editor Ben Wilson tested the 9800X3D using an MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi motherboard, Liquid Freezer III 360 cooler, and G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5 RAM. In his Ryzen 7 9800X3D review, he stated: "Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Like the predecessor Ryzen 7 7800X3D, this is a processor intended mainly for gaming. Its productivity scores, as Wilson states, aren't exceptional, falling behind even the Core Ultra 5 245K in a bunch of productivity benchmarks. Here's a look at the results. As expected, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's performance absolutely shines in games. As you can see below, it pulls far ahead of Intel's latest Core Ultra 9 285K flagship in demanding games. That's despite the Core Ultra 9 having more cores, more threads, a higher clock speed, and a higher TDP. Wilson also pulled a bunch of real-world benchmarks from the games listed in the chart above for a better idea of where performance lies. These are some of the most demanding games out there right now, but it's clear that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has no problems running them. Standout metrics include the Ryzen 7 9800X3D reaching a 52% performance increase in Cyberpunk 2077, as well as a 43% increase to performance in Far Cry 6. Even the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6 hits a 41% increase compared to Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is undoubtedly tempting for any serious PC gamers. I know I've had my eye on the new chip since rumors began, and based on the positive reviews I plan on putting together a PC upgrade plan. • Best Xbox/PC headsets• Best Windows laptops• Best laptops w/ num pads• Best Xbox storage• Best sim racing PCs• Best ROG Ally accessories• Best gaming laptops I'm coming from a Ryzen 7 5800X chip, which is now a few generations old. In fact, it's using an older AM4 motherboard socket and DDR4 RAM, which means I'll need to upgrade the motherboard and memory when I make the chip change. If you're working with a Ryzen 5000 chip, you'll need to do the same. Whether or not that makes financial sense right now only you can say. If you are looking to upgrade to the new Zen 5 chip, have a look at top motherboards for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D to get you started. If you're already working with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, chances are you don't see much need to upgrade to the 9800X3D. Your upgrade path will be easier due to the 7800X3D using the AM5 socket and DDR5 RAM, but the $479 MSRP for the 9800X3D no doubt seems a bit steep when your 7800X3D is still so potent. Here's a quick look at the Ryzen 9800X3D and 7800X3D specifications. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is now available for purchase at major online retailers like Best Buy, Newegg, B&H, and Amazon. You're looking at the same $479 launch price across retailers, and that's expected to stick for the time being. It's always within the realm of possibility that the new CPU will drop in price for Black Friday or Cyber Monday if there's any stock left to discount. If you're buying at launch, here are the retailers currently offering the chip at $479. I'm expecting to see plenty of pre-built gaming PCs have the Ryzen 7 9800X3D as a centerpiece, but at the time of the chip's launch, your options are limited. With the standalone CPUs now sold out everywhere I look, a pre-built might be your next best option. I first spotted a couple of custom PCs from iBuyPower. There are set models starting at $2,099, but you can configure them with a ton of different hardware centered around the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The lowest price I could configure was $1,346, and there's almost no limit to what you can add if your budget allows. iBuyPower AMD Ryzen X3D Pro A massive collection of configuration options allows you to build your PC from the screws up, and it's all centered around the new AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU. 👉 See at iBuyPower.com CyberPowerPC is so far the only other builder I spotted featuring the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. There are six pre-builts available at the time of writing, each with a different case and liquid cooler. Prices start at $1,685 for the 9800X3D, RTX 4060 Ti GPU, 32GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. 👉 See CyberPowerPC's Ryzen 7 9800X3D pre-built PCs Yes, the predecessor Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still available to buy. It is, however, more expensive now than it was at launch. In some countries, including Canada where I'm located, it's practically impossible to find. That's a testament to its lasting power and popularity. With the best price I can find hovering around $476 at Amazon — or around $570 at Newegg and Walmart — you might as well buy the newer Ryzen 7 9800X3D for about the same price. My recommendation changes if the price of the 7800X3D suddenly drops following the 9800X3D launch. There's also Black Friday and Cyber Monday heading our way in a few weeks, which is usually a great opportunity to save significantly on PC parts and upgrades. AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains a killer option for gamers, though its popularity has caused prices to spike in the lead-up to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's launch. If prices should fall below those of the newer chip, I strongly recommend it as an alternative. The best price at the time of writing is at Amazon ($476). 👉 Available at: Amazon | Walmart | Newegg Cale Hunt brings to Windows Central more than eight years of experience writing about laptops, PCs, accessories, games, and beyond.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Tyler Durden | Nov 7, 2024 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. Trump won in 2016, he also won in 2020 (but it was stolen from him thanks to 20 million “vapor” votes which magically failed to make a re-appearance in 2024), and he just won again in a landslide, not just the electoral but the popular vote as well… and boy are markets rocking! Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election has unleashed a shockwave in global markets as traders prepared for unprecedented policy and economic changes under the new administration. Trump’s political comeback sparked a surge in risk assets, sending 30-year Treasury yields and the dollar to their biggest gains since 2020… … Dow futures soared more than 1,300 points… …. S&P 500 futures climbed 2.3%… … and Bitcoin spiked to a record. Tesla co-founded by Trump’s biggest backer Elon Musk, surged 15% in premarket trading. From London to Tokyo, investors around the globe grappled with the far-reaching effects of a Trump presidency, which according to Bloomberg “is expected to bring steep tariffs on imported products, worsen trade tensions with China, and increase pressure on Europe to ramp up defense spending.” Apparently, it is also sending risk assets soaring. The Mexican peso – viewed as the anti-Trump trade due to his threats to flood Mexico’s economy with tariffs – fell the most in three months and the euro led losses among Group-of-10 currencies. “We’ve been talking about this Trump trade for a while. The fairly aggressive market reaction shows that investors didn’t know what to put on, and now they know,” Marvin Loh, senior macro strategist at State Street Global Markets, told Bloomberg TV. “A lot of us will be asking which ones potentially have either a lot more to move or really do not yet reflect the type of administration.” For those who missed it, here is a recap of what happened in the year’s biggest event: This is how all major asset classes reacted: Equities also reflected expectations that Trump would loosen financial regulation, embrace crypto, and support fossil fuel producers. JPMorgan and Bank of America shares advanced in early trading. Tilray, a cannabis company, sank 10% after Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana. Elsewhere in the premarket: Some other notable premarket movers: Goldman’s trading desk said a Republican sweep may push the S&P 500 up by 3%, while moves would be half as much in the event of a divided government. A Morgan Stanley note said risk-taking appetite may dip in the event of a Republican sweep as fiscal concerns fuel yields, but if bond markets take it in their stride the likes of growth-sensitive cyclical stocks would rise. We will have much more to say on the kneejerk reactions, but here are some more hot takes from Wall Street: In Europe, stock gains have faded slightly as investors contemplate the risk of increased potential trade protectionism by a Trump administration. The Stoxx 600 is up 1.2% with health care and travel shares leading gains, while utilities and automobile sectors were the biggest laggards. Here are the biggest movers on Wednesday: In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is up 1.4%, with the greenback logging its largest gain against the euro in the G-10 space. The Mexican peso is one of the biggest losers overall with a 2.6% drop. In rates, treasuries lost out, with US 10-year yields jumping 17 bps to 4.44% and the 2s10s curve steepening. Traders also pared Fed interest-rate cut bets while amping up their bets of European rate reductions, pricing in a faster pace of easing by the ECB and BOE to the benefit of bunds and gilts. In commodities, oil prices decline, with WTI falling 1.3% to $71 a barrel. Spot gold drops $24 to around $2,720/oz. Bitcoin soared 7% to a record high. To the day ahead now, data releases include German factory orders for September, and the final services and composite PMIs for October in the Euro Area. From central banks, we’ll hear from ECB President Lagarde, Vice President de Guindos, and the ECB’s Escriva, Vujcic, and Villeroy. Market Snapshot Top Overnight News A more detailed look at global markets courtesy of Newsquawk APAC stocks mostly followed suit to the risk on performance on Wall St as participants digested the US Presidential Election results where Trump is leading so far, and betting markets boosted their pricing of the former President returning to the White House. ASX 200 was lifted with outperformance in tech, consumer discretionary, and financials leading the gains seen in all sectors. Nikkei 225 surged above the 39,000 level with the momentum propelled by a weaker currency. Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp lagged with the Hong Kong benchmark the worst hit as tech was pressured amid the increased tariff threat for Chinese companies, while the mainland traded indecisively as prospects of looming fiscal stimulus offset the tariff threat. Top Asian News European bourses, Stoxx 600 (+1.7%) opened on a strong footing and continue to edge higher, with Presidential Candidate Trump poised to win the election. Indices have dipped off best levels in recent trade. Note, that European futures were lower by as much as 1% pre-open, before picking up given the US enthusiasm. European sectors hold a strong positive bias, with only Utilities and Autos trading in the red; the latter sensitive to potential tariff updates. Healthcare tops the pack, buoyed by gains in Novo Nordisk, post-earnings. US Equity Futures (ES 2.1%, NQ +1.7%, RTY +5.5%) are entirely in the green, with the “Trump Trade” very much in full swing, with the Republican nominee on the cusp of a historic victory. As a result, the economy-linked RTY is the clear outperformer today. US pre-market movers include; Tesla (+12.9%), Trump Media (+38.5%), Exxon (+2.9%), Morgan Stanley (+5.9%), JD.Com (-4.1%) Top European News FX Fixed Income Commodities Geopolitics US Event Calendar DB’s Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap It’s been a big night with Mr Trump looking set to become just the second President to serve non-consecutive terms in history, and the first for well over a hundred years, after Grover Cleveland in the late-19th century. So a likely remarkable political comeback after an approval rating in the low 30 percent range when he left office in January 2021. As we type, the New York Times needle, which is a well respected forecasting gauge has Trump with a 92% chance of victory. Polymarket.com is pricing it at 97%. Of the battleground states, only North Carolina and Georgia have so far been called by the media in favour of Trump with the other 5 with a probability of 64-80% going to Trump. The potential tipping point state of Pennsylvania has a 79% probability. In terms of Congress, the House will be the key to whether there is a “red sweep”. Here we may not have more clarity until later in the day or even later in the week. The seats have all gone as expected so far which suggests it could be very close. The perception is that the popular vote may be the best proxy for this and here the NYT needle’s estimate suggests Trump is likely to win by 1pp, albeit with a 3pp margin for error on either side. If Trump does win the popular vote it will be the first time in his three election runs. Polymarket has swung a lot in the last hour but the House going Republican is at 64% as I finish typing at 5:45 am. So it seems the biggest market debate will now be between a Trump red sweep and a Trump divided government where the House stays with the Democrats. As a reminder, control of the House will be important for policy expectations and markets. While our strategists have seen a Trump victory as positive for the dollar (see here), not least given significant presidential authority on trade policy, congressional control will be important in many areas, especially fiscal policy. Our economists have previously viewed a Republican sweep as having the most upside in terms of fiscal easing (see here), with potential corresponding upside for the Fed terminal rate. Our strategists also saw a red sweep scenario as having the clearest upside for Treasury yields. The market reaction so far is probably going as you would expect given the results. The 10yr Treasury yield is up +12bps to 4.39%, the dollar index is +1.26% higher, with the euro falling -1.27% against the greenback. That comes after the dollar index fell -0.45% yesterday, starting the week with its worst two-day run (-0.82%) since August. Other Trump trades benefiting include Bitcoin rising +7.26%. S&P (+1.02%) and Nasdaq +(0.84%) futures are both up as I type. Red sweep trades are off their highs with the direction of the House being in a little doubt. One thing to consider is that if there is a split Congress, you could argue that tariff policy becomes the priority assuming Trump wins, as he won’t be able to get his tax policy through without negotiations. European equity futures are -0.59% lower and European bond futures are a lot flatter than US bonds as markets wake up to the implications of Trump’s likely tariff policies. If the results continue to move in this direction, then the prospects of the ECB being forced to move faster will increase. Nothing happens in isolation though, and there is risk of an early German election given events over the last few days which our economists have discussed here. This could have some implications for fiscal policy. Elsewhere China’s NPC standing committee may announce more clarity on fiscal policy when the meeting ends on Friday. It’s possible they have been waiting for the results of the US election to calibrate things. So lots of moving parts. In Asia, the Nikkei is outperforming with a gain of +1.87%, and the S&P/ASX 200 is also up by +0.85%. Conversely, the Hang Seng Tech Index is down by -3.03%, followed by the Hang Seng, which has dropped -2.61% and the KOSPI (-0.93%). Mainland Chinese stocks are fairly flat. Yesterday might feel like ancient history now, but before we knew the direction of the likely election result, markets saw a strong risk-on move thanks to an upside surprise in the ISM services index for October. It rose to its highest level since July 2022, coming in at 56.0 (vs. 53.8 expected), and the details were also very positive. For instance, the employment component was back at an expansionary 53.0, marking its highest level since August 2023. And even though there was a modest downtick in new orders to 57.4, it was still the second-strongest print since February 2023. That release continued the run of positive data surprises from the US recently, and it led investors to pare back their expectations for rate cuts over the months ahead. The rate priced in for the Fed’s December 2025 meeting was up +3.7bps yesterday to 3.66%, taking pricing back to roughly where it was before the summer market turmoil. However, the rise in rates proved fleeting on the long end of the curve. 10-year Treasury yields ended the day -1.3bps lower at 4.27%, despite trading +8bps intra-day early on, with the reversal helped by a decent 10-year auction. Obviously, all this has changed this morning. Speaking of bonds selling off, yesterday saw UK gilts continue to underperform amidst weak demand at a 10-year auction. That follows last week’s announcement of noticeably higher borrowing in the budget, and it meant the spread of 10-year gilt yields over bunds widened by another +4.0bps to 211bps. That’s the biggest gap since Liz Truss was still PM back in October 2022, having risen by nearly 50bps since mid-September. In absolute terms, the 10-year gilt yield was up +7.2bps to a one-year high of 4.53%. Elsewhere in Europe, the selloff also saw yields on 10-year bunds (+3.3bps) hit a three-month high of 2.42%. US equities showed no signs of pre-election jitters, as the S&P 500 (+1.23%) posted its strongest gain since September to close less than 1.5pp from its record high. That was supported by the upbeat data, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for Q4 stood at 2.38% after yesterday’s releases. So there’s little sign that the strong growth of late is easing, which has continued to boost risk assets. The megacap tech stocks led the way, with the Magnificent 7 up +1.76%, with Nvidia (+2.84%) overtaking Apple (+0.64%) as the world’s most valuable company. The tech advance was supported by software platform provider Palantir Technologies (+23.47%) after it reported strong AI-related demand. But the gains were broad-based with all 24 industry groups within the S&P 500 higher on the day and the small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.88%) outperforming. European markets were fairly subdued, and the STOXX 600 was only up +0.06%. To the day ahead now, data releases include German factory orders for September, and the final services and composite PMIs for October in the Euro Area. From central banks, we’ll hear from ECB President Lagarde, Vice President de Guindos, and the ECB’s Escriva, Vujcic, and Villeroy.

Title: In leaked internal meeting, Amazon retail chief says sales of cheaper items are surging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-seeing-surge-sales-cheaper-items-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-07T10:00:02Z

The sales of cheaper items are surging on Amazon. During a recent internal all-hands meeting, Amazon's retail CEO Doug Herrington said that the everyday essentials business, which includes health, beauty, and grocery products, is "growing 50% faster than the rest of the store," according to a recording of the event obtained by Business Insider. The growth is primarily driven by faster delivery speeds because people tend to spend more and shop more frequently when orders arrive quickly, Herrington said. Over 50% of those everyday essentials are now delivered on the same or next day, he added. "It has really supercharged our grocery and everyday essential business," Herrington said, referring to faster shipping speeds. "And these are especially the low-priced everyday essentials, the things that most households purchase every week." Amazon has been investing heavily to make its warehouse and logistics network more regional. The goal has been to not only speed up deliveries, but also make it less expensive for the company to offer faster delivery. Lower costs help Amazon offer cheaper products, which often come with thinner profit margins. This is a notable shift from the company's previous strategy of curbing sales of such products. Internally, Amazon used to refer to these products as "CRaP," or "can't realize a profit," because they were relatively expensive to ship and less profitable. Amazon's record profits in recent years, alongside drastic cost cuts and major layoffs, are also contributing to the new approach. The change can potentially help Amazon better compete against Chinese e-commerce upstarts Temu and Shein, which are rapidly growing on the back of cheap items. Shein, for example, is expanding to sell more daily essentials, like toothpaste, skincare, and toys, Reuters reported. Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment. During the recent all-hands meeting, Herrington said Amazon deliveries have become faster and cheaper after the company redesigned its network of warehouses to serve smaller regions. Now, Amazon has more warehouses assigned to customers close by, which allows for faster order fulfillment. As a result, Amazon has been able to reduce the "cost to serve" each order for two years in a row, while achieving the fastest delivery speeds for Prime shipments this year, Herrington added. "We call that effort perfect placement," Herrington said. In October, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company has been "maniacal" about lowering the cost to serve in recent years. It's a real competitive advantage because now Amazon can afford to sell lower-priced items economically, he said. "There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices," Jassy said during a call with analysts. During last month's analyst call, Jassy added that the growth of cheaper items is a "real positive" because it is predicated on faster delivery speeds. He said that this usually leads to growth in customer loyalty, order frequency, and purchase volume. "We see the ability to unlock whole new elements of the consumer spend," Jassy said. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's CFO, added that strong growth in everyday essentials is a positive sign of Amazon becoming a part of consumers' daily shopping habits. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a recent note that the shift is important for Amazon, especially since its most loyal Prime membership base is growing at a slower pace. "While the growth in those categories represents a negative mix shift in terms of margins, it increases shopper loyalty, shopping frequency and increases the basket size — important if the total Prime HH membership base in the US is maturing," Mahaney wrote. Amazon is doubling down on these efforts. Herrington said in the recent all-hands meeting that Amazon is investing in new warehouse robotics technology that can further improve packaging speed. It's also expanding its rural area network and drone delivery service, he said. "The most important part is that customers are loving our faster speeds and we know they're loving it because they're shopping more," Herrington said. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: Recent tech layoffs reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths

The year 2024 has been brutal for tech workers. What started as a trickle of downsizing in 2022 has now turned into a full-blown wave of layoffs that shows no signs of stopping. From Silicon Valley to Tel Aviv and across Europe’s biggest tech hubs, tens of thousands of workers are being let go as companies scramble to stay profitable in the face of economic uncertainty, rising costs, and a rapid shift toward automation.Major players such as Google, Intel, Tesla, and Amazon have been drastically downsizing their workforce, impacting roles across various departments from engineering to customer service and even key areas such as AI. Intel, facing intense competition and delays in product development, has slashed 15,000 jobs and recently announced an additional 2,200 cuts in the United States, with more layoffs expected in Israel. Similarly, Tesla, grappling with surging material costs, cut 14,000 employees as part of its operational tightening. Meanwhile, in a shocking move, Google laid off 12,000 workers, ruthlessly eliminating entire teams overnight as it restructures and pivots toward AI-driven initiatives.The message from these corporations is clear: In the world’s most profitable industry, if the bottom line is threatened, no role is safe. While the numbers paint a bleak picture, the real story is how different regions deal with the fallout. Layoffs in the US, Israel, and Europe reflect their unique business cultures, legal frameworks, and societal values, creating wildly different experiences for employees caught in the crossfire.In the US, tech layoffs are fast, sharp, and often brutal. With at-will employment laws giving companies the flexibility to cut staff quickly, American tech giants have embraced this “slash and burn” strategy. Google’s mass firing of 12,000 employees was carried out with cold efficiency, leaving workers with little notice and little room for negotiation. Meta, which laid off 21,000 workers across several rounds in 2023, also epitomized this approach. Employees were notified via email, and, in many cases, their access to systems was immediately revoked, creating an atmosphere of sudden shock and panic. The focus here is always on the bottom line, with efficiency reigning supreme over personal impact​. IN JANUARY, Bill Ackman and his wife Neri Oxman bought 4.9% of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for $25 million in a move that signaled confidence in the Israeli economy. The writer asks: What if similarly influential businesspeople set aside a cumulative investment of $1 billion in Israeli tech startup (credit: AMIR COHEN/REUTERS)Yet, this approach has come under fire for its harshness. As these companies tighten operations and invest more heavily in AI and automation, the human cost of rapid layoffs is often overlooked, sparking anger and frustration among workers who feel disposable.What are tech layoffs like in Israel and around the world?IN ISRAEL, layoffs cut deeper. Israeli workplace culture is highly relational, with close bonds between employees and managers. This makes layoffs not just a business decision but a personal loss. Mobileye, one of Israel’s leading tech firms, slashed 200 jobs in 2023, causing a ripple of emotional fallout throughout the company.​ Managers held direct face-to-face conversations with workers, and the news often broke in company forums rather than sterile HR emails. These decisions felt heavier, with employees expressing a sense of betrayal.In Israel, companies often go to great lengths to cushion the blow. Extended notice periods, severance packages, and assistance finding new employment are more common, reflecting a broader cultural value of solidarity in difficult times.In many ways, Europe’s response to layoffs is the most dramatic. Strong labor laws, unions, and a deep cultural commitment to workers’ rights mean that job cuts aren’t just handed down; they are fought. When Orange announced layoffs in France in 2024, it led to street protests and protracted negotiations with unions, demanding fair compensation and alternatives such as voluntary departures.​ French labor law, designed to protect workers from sudden terminations, forced the company into lengthy discussions, often delaying the process for months.

German law requires extensive consultation with employees and unions before mass layoffs occur, creating a slow, bureaucratic process. In some cases, tensions rose so high that SAP executives faced heckling and protests from disgruntled employees, forcing the company to navigate legal and social challenges simultaneously.The US approach, marked by ruthless efficiency, contrasts sharply with Europe’s protective laws and Israel’s emotionally charged downsizing. In America, layoffs are seen as a necessary evil to maintain business health, even if it means throwing workers into uncertainty with little notice. In Israel, the process is more personal but equally painful, tearing apart tight-knit communities that view their workplace as an extension of family. Conversely, Europe takes a combative stance, with workers protected by legal frameworks and unions, leading to public backlash and prolonged negotiations.The tech layoffs of 2024 reflect not just economic realities but cultural truths. As companies worldwide pivot towards AI, automation, and cost-cutting strategies, how they handle the human cost of these decisions reveals as much about their values as their balance sheets. Ultimately, these layoffs expose the intersection of technology, humanity, and culture in a way that no algorithm can fully calculate.

Title: Nvidia Stock Prices to Watch as AI Darling Becomes World's Most Valuable Company

Time Published: 2024-11-07T01:09:51Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move. This technique works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and adding that amount to the initial breakout area. In other words, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target of $180. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The rupee declined 6 paise to close at a fresh lifetime low of 84.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as weak domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows dented market sentiment. Forex traders said investors were also cautious ahead of the US Fed meeting outcome. Moreover, overnight gains in crude oil prices also weighed on the local unit. However, a correction in the dollar index against major currencies helped the rupee and restrained the slide, they added. Aurionpro Solutions, a leading technology provider, has secured a significant contract from Chennai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (CMRL) to deliver automated fare collection (AFC) systems for Phase II of the Chennai Metro. The shares of Aurionpro Solutions Limited were trading at ₹1,665 down by ₹30 or 1.77 per cent during the closing bell. Swiggy IPO has been subscribed 0.34 times as of 3.36 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.28 times, NII 0.12 times, retail 0.81 times, and those reserved for employees 1.11 times. The issue closes on November 8, 2024. G R Infraprojects has emerged as L-1 bidder for establishing “Transmission Scheme for integration of Bijapur REZ” in the State of Karnataka, through tariff based competitive bidding (TBCB) process on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis Shares trade flat on the BSE at ₹1,630.90. Suraj Ltd has implemented the 1st phase of Flanges product plant. Company is in implementing phase of carbon steel plant and it will be completed by April 2025. Stock trades flat on the NSE at ₹440.90 Swiggy IPO subscribed 0.31 times. Track live updates. Top gainers: Apollo Hospitals (6.67%), SBI (0.50%), HDFC Life (0.37%), TCS (0.19%), L&T (0.19%) Top losers: Hindalco (-8.42%), Trent (-6.91%), Grasim (-3.34%), Shriram Finance (-3.03%), Tech Mahindra (-2.67%) Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on November 7, 2024, were 1,834 against 2,079 stocks that declined, and 121 remained unchanged. Total stocks traded were 4,034. The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 240, and those that hit a 52-week low was 13. A total of 350 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 198 in the lower circuit. The Nifty opened within the range of the previous day, and has slid since after an attempt to build on yesterday’s advance. For the day, support near 24,400 will be key. This is because any close under this level will create a “bearish dark cloud cover”. If the decline worsens, then participants will be watching yesterday’s open 24,309 closely - if the market ends below this marker it will create the more powerful “bearish engulfing”. For the last few days, 24,500 has served as resistance and will continue to be the critical upside hurdle going forward. On the downside, 24,309 and 24,204 will be key levels to watch. Niva Bupa Health Insurance Company IPO has been subscribed 0.54 times as of 2.27 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.78 times, NII 0.03 times, and retail 0.56 times. The issue closes on November 11, 2024. Almost 50% valuation compared to Zomato gives some comfort although it should not be considered as an arbitrage in valuation. If Swiggy’s EBITDA catches up to 3-4% in the food delivery business, which is currently at 1% and Average Order Value (AOV) improves to Rs. 550-600 levels in quick commerce with higher non-grocery share, we can see bridging in the valuation gap. Although, this should not be expected in near term. ​Sagility India IPO​ has been subscribed 2.32 times as of 2.18 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 2.65 times, NII 0.93 times, retail 3.42 times, and those reserved for employees 3.26 times. The issue closes today. Brokerage Motilal Oswal recognised that Swiggy pioneered the hyperlocal commerce industry in India, launching food delivery in 2014 and quick commerce in 2020, and is well-recognised as a leader in innovation. Swiggy operates in an oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Motilal analysts remarked that the food delivery platform’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. Indian equity benchmarks extended their losses in afternoon trading on Thursday, with the BSE Sensex plunging 782.84 points to 79,595.29 and the NSE Nifty dropping 262.10 points to 24,221.95, marking a decline of 0.97 per cent and 1.07 per cent respectively. 1.

The decisive win by Trump of the US mandate, stronger than expected, the probability of easing of tensions in the middle east is now a high possibility. At the same time, his statements over the next few weeks could put some cats amongst the pigeons as he makes noises on China, Russia, Oil and of course, renewables. With the USD gaining strength, Gold – being inversely related, is bound to fall and therefore the Fed meeting today holds great importance as to the future direction of bonds and the dollar. On the one hand the pre election rhetoric points to yields hardening in the US, growth and incremental data is unlikely to change the trajectory that the central banks wish to take and will act as a counter. Hence a bit of bumpiness is expected in the next 2-3 weeks and maybe right upto the President elect assuming office in January. Gold as of now remains on an uptrend but like we have been saying, tight stops are necessary especially if the pivots around USD 2600 are challenged as that would mark a significant break. Till then, its anticipated that the initial kneejerk reaction on the USD may reverse esp if President Trump talks around higher deficits that could put pressure on the USD. “ Driven by tractor and automobile sales, Mahindra & Mahindra is expected to report strong revenue growth in Q2.

The six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), which met from October 7-9, had decided unanimously to change the stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’. However, it kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent by a majority of 5 out of 6 members.

Full Content:
Nvidia, a leading American software company, reclaims the title of the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization, topping tech giant Apple. The company’s shares jumped by 2.5% during Tuesday’s trading hours, pushing its market valuation to roughly $3.44 trillion, topping Apple’s $3.37 trillion. The world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, have been contesting the “world’s most valuable company” tag for most of the year. However, Nvidia was the year’s surprise story thanks to its investment in chips that power the Artificial Intelligence technology. Nvidia has been bolstered by the 850% growth in the AI and machine learning space and the growth of AI-based coins. As the company enjoys an increased demand for its chips, other AI coins like the Internet Computer, the NEAR protocol, Bittensor, Injective, and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance have enjoyed their respective surges too. Nvidia overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company https://t.co/chWMKMofPL pic.twitter.com/Zfqa4PBYcu — CNA (@ChannelNewsAsia) October 25, 2024 Last September 6th, Nvidia’s price was just $102.83 but soon started to climb thanks to increasing demand for its chips. At the heart of its operations are the AI chips that power many large language models today. According to Fall Ainina of James Investment Research, Nvidia’s current position is linked to machine learning and generative AI industry growth. Thanks to its role in advancing AI technology, the company’s stock has increased by over 850% since 2022. The company supplies chips to top tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and even Microsoft. Analysts expect the company’s revenues to beat the company’s estimates, with an additional 44% growth next year. Nvidia’s impressive performance this year can be attributed to the demand for its chips and the growth in AI coins. For example, there’s NEAR protocol, which jumped by 5.40%. It’s currently priced at $3.81, with over $222 million in 24-hour trading volume. Internet Computer is another AI coin that’s surging, adding 5% to its market value, with a market volume of $57 million. Plenty of AI coins are joining the tech firm’s market rally. Bittensor is now trading at $482, and Artificial Superintelligence is rising to $1.25, reflecting an increase of 10.96%. Nvidia’s growing market cap and the continuing popularity of AI coins highlight AI’s increasing influence. Some of the top Wall Street companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, are now working with the company to expand their AI capabilities. Market analysts expect the company and AI coins to sustain their rally in the short term. As of this writing, Nvidia accounts for 7% of the US S&P 500 Index weight. It’s also crucial to note that AI stocks like Nvidia are some of the performing stocks for the year.

The net worths of many of the world’s wealthiest people skyrocketed Thursday, particularly those with strong ties to cryptocurrency, with stocks soaring following Donald Trump’s election win as the president-elect is expected to embrace cryptocurrency and corporate tax cuts during his upcoming term. Musk is one of Trump's most wealthy backers. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Elon Musk: The Tesla chief, who was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers in the lead-up to the election, experienced a nearly $21 billion jolt to his net worth Wednesday, bringing it to $285.6 billion as Tesla’s stock closed up nearly 15% on Wednesday at $288.53—its highest share price recorded this year. Jeff Bezos: Bezos’ net worth is up $7 billion to $223.5 billion after a strong day of trading for Amazon shares (up 3.8%), maintaining his position as the world’s second-wealthiest person behind Musk. Larry Ellison: The Oracle co-founder is nearly $12 billion richer, as his net worth jumped to $220.8 billion and lessened the gap between him and Bezos for No. 2 on Forbes’ billionaire list. Warren Buffett: The world-renowned investor’s net worth spiked $7.6 billion Wednesday, bringing it to $147.4 billion, with Berkshire Hathaway rising more than 5%. Brian Armstrong: Armstrong, the CEO of crypto platform Coinbase, has an estimated $11 billion net worth after a $2.6 billion increase Wednesday, the result of a whopping 31% surge for Coinbase as it closed at $254.31 (the platform’s co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, became $600 million richer as markets closed). Vlad Tenev & Baiju Bhatt: The Robinhood co-founders’ net worths climbed together, with Bhatt’s up $307 million to $1.9 billion and Tenev’s up nearly $300 million to $1.9 billion, as well (Robinhood shares surged almost 20% Wednesday). Michael Saylor: Saylor, the founder of bitcoin strategy firm MicroStrategy, became nearly $600 million richer as his estimated net worth climbed to $6.6 billion while the company’s stock swelled 13% to $257.81—one of its highest points of the year.

Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg did not join in on the rush, as he experienced a small drop in net worth to $197.9 billion and kept his place as the fourth-wealthiest person in the world behind Ellison. Meta shares ended the trading day at $572.05—down $0.38. Bitcoin reached an all-time high Wednesday, skyrocketing past the $76,000 mark in reaction to Trump’s electoral victory. Businesses and crypto-related stocks are likely reacting positively to the election results because Trump has positioned himself as a “crypto president” and promised tax cuts to prominent CEOs including Apple’s Tim Cook and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon. Cryptocurrency investors also believe his presidency will be favorable for crypto regulations, as Trump said this year he aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet”—a full reversal from the doubts and criticisms he levied at cryptocurrency years ago.

Title: Trump's election win could take the U.S.-China chip war to a new level

Since President-elect Donald Trump’s first term in office, the U.S. has wielded its trade restriction and sanctioning powers in an effort to curb China’s technological advances. Now that he’s headed back to the White House, the semiconductor war between the U.S. and China could escalate. “If Trump ascends to the office, he’s already said in his campaign rhetoric that he’s going to double down and even make tariffs as well as export controls more severe,” Arthur Dong, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz in a pre-election interview. Efforts to slow China’s advanced chipmaking abilities under Trump’s first presidential term were continued by the Biden administration. Earlier this year, the Biden administration was reportedly debating using an export control called the foreign direct product rule, which would impact companies in U.S. allies including Japan’s Tokyo Electron (TOELY-1.78%) and Dutch chip machine-maker ASML (ASML-1.09%). The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. It was later reported that some allies would be exempt if the rule is expanded. “He’s [Trump] likely to go further than the Biden administration has gone with regard to the imposition of blanket tariffs across a much wider variety of goods,” Dong said. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. Trump extended the ban on Huawei’s products through 2021, and trade restrictions on it and other Chinese tech firms have only tightened under the Biden administration. Before the election, U.S.-based chip equipment makers were reportedly bracing for more export controls under the Biden administration, telling suppliers they worried about risking their vendor status for using certain components supplied by China. The companies also reportedly told suppliers not to have Chinese investors or shareholders. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” ASML chief executive Christophe Fouquet said in October. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” During his most recent campaign for the presidency, Trump said he would impose tariffs on chips from Taiwan, which could have a heavy impact on global chipmaking, as a majority of the world’s most advanced chips are fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.02%). The Taiwanese-chipmaker counts Nvidia (NVDA-0.83%) and Apple (AAPL-0.08%) as major customers. In October, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry during an appearance on the The Joe Rogan Experience podcast — a point he also made in July during an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In response to a question about supporting Taiwan against Chinese aggression, Trump said the island “took our chip business from us.” “I mean, how stupid are we,” Trump said. “They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy.” Instead, Trump said, Taiwan should be paying the U.S. to protect it. “I don’t think we’re any different from an insurance policy,” Trump told Bloomberg. “Why? Why are we doing this?” During his interview with Rogan, Trump also criticized the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 — partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. “That chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they’re not going to give us the good companies anyway,” Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Over a dozen chipmakers, including U.S.-based Intel (INTC-0.11%), Taiwan-based TSMC, and South Korea-based SK Hynix, are still awaiting billions of dollars in funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS Act to build semiconductor hubs throughout the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Will New Trump Administration Set Off Merger Fever In Hollywood?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2024/11/06/will-new-trump-administration-set-off-merger-fever-in-hollywood/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T22:21:15Z

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Among the outgrowths of Donald Trump’s presidential victory is an expected shift in antitrust and other regulatory interventions, well timed for battered Hollywood studios hoping to restructure for a post-Streaming Wars era. In case you missed it, Netflix won those Streaming Wars, perhaps more emphatically than anything in the political sphere this year. Financially strained studios have cut thousands of jobs, killed off projects, reduced new program orders, sold off pieces to private equity, and otherwise pondered what next if they’re to survive and thrive. As MoffettNathanson senior analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note: “The battle caused a lot of damage to traditional media and Netflix has emerged as the clear victor.” Studio chiefs have mused in various public settings about joint ventures, partnerships, and outright mergers and acquisitions as a way to better compete against Netflix and the video operations of tech titans Apple, Alphabet and Amazon. Now, with changes afoot at what has been a reflexively anti-merger Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, media moguls may again get to mogul-ing, instead of bemoaning their fates while leaving many others unemployed. The latest trial balloon came during last week’s Comcast earnings call, when President Robert Cavanagh surprised listeners, saying the company is considering spinning off or otherwise removing its cable operations from Comcast’s complicated corporate structure, while holding on to both the NBC broadcast network and loss-making, under-sized streaming service Peacock. “We are now exploring,” Cavanagh said, “whether creating a new well-capitalized company, owned by our shareholders and composed of our strong portfolio of cable networks, would position them to take advantage of opportunities in the changing media landscape and create value for our shareholders.” Macquarie senior media-tech analyst Tim Nollen wrote that a cable spinoff likely would help Comcast’s shares and core media assets, but questioned who would invest in a troubled, declining sector, especially if the assets are stripped of the cross-platform synergies possible now. For instance, the all-news MSNBC and all-business-news CNBC share many assets with NBC News. How would they disentangle, and what would be left of value? “(Comcast’s) NBCU(niversal) has been deemphasizing cable nets for some time, exiting regional sports and putting content on Peacock; new NBA rights were won thanks to broadcast and Peacock - not cable, as Warner Bros Discovery found out,” Nollen wrote. “We question how valuable cable networks would be stand-alone, without ties to NBCU's studio and streaming capability, and lacking advertising tie-ins; industry M&A/JVs appear possible.” The cable spinoff is just one possible deal that likely will be more feasible under a Trump regime with a more wave-it-through approach. But it won’t be the only one. For instance, private equity giant TPG is trying to do two deals in one: take over AT&T’s minority share of DirecTV and merge it with competitor DISH Networks. Given the struggles vexing both satellite TV providers, and DISH’s particularly perilous finances, even Biden/Harris regulators were expected to probably approve the merger, much as happened in 2008 with the Sirius and XM satellite radio services. The biggest challenge there might be DISH bondholders who don’t want to take a haircut on their notes. Shari Redstone has agreed to sell her stake in Paramount Global to a consortium led by Skydance founder David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely also would have been approved regardless, but the elder Ellison’s close relationship with Trump may speed things along. And given the uncertainties around Paramount’s clutch of cable networks, it may simplify some of the restructuring both Paramount’s current management and Ellison may have in mind. But lots of clues suggest far more dealmaking across the industry is in the offing. What might that look like? To begin with, MoffettNathanson’s Fishman attempted to quantify what a major modern media company (to paraphrase Gilbert & Sullivan) might look like. “Companies for whom video is a core part of the business trade at significant discounts, with Netflix’s enterprise value now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined!” wrote Fishman in a research note released last week. “Where does that leave the rest of the field? What does each player bring to the table, and how might a bit of strategic M&A augment their position?” It’s increasingly clear what assets those reshaped media companies would need to compete as the industry enters the second half of the 2020s, Fishman wrote. “We see these assets as: a scaled streaming service (both in the U.S. and globally), a free AVOD platform, top-tier sports rights, a U.S. broadcast network, and film and television studios,” Fishman wrote. Broadcast has the broadest reach, and as cable viewership fades, “Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners...Sports drive viewership, subscriptions and advertising dollars,” Fishman wrote. Disney remains the combined leader in overall viewership most months across all platforms, though YouTube with its vast supply of user-generated content sometimes grabs the mantle, according to Nielsen statistics released at the recent Advertising Research Foundation’s OTT conference. That cross-platform approach suggests there’s still power even in older distribution platforms when it’s intelligently harnessed and cross-promoted. “As for non-sports viewing, free AVOD / FAST channel platforms bring reach and inventory that can supplement ad sales across a portfolio,” Fishman wrote. “AVOD is the basic cable networks of the streaming age. These platforms now provide an avenue for monetizing older content for companies with large catalogues.” There are some combinations of existing media companies that might fill respective holes on each side, and would make sense as the companies try to scale up against Netflix and the Titans. Fox, for instance, has hugely popular AVOD platform Tubi and a broadcast network with strong sports rights in the NFL and other major sports, even after it sold off most film and TV studio assets to Disney in 2019. Warner Bros. Discovery, by contrast, has highly regarded film and TV production studios, the increasingly global Max streaming service with more than 100 million subscribers, and its own batch of sports rights (though it loses the NBA after this season). That’s why, Fishman wrote, “When thinking about the next potential media deal, we continue to see a marriage of Fox and WBD’s assets as the most natural fit, especially when considering how it would fill WBD’s current need for top-tier sports rights and grant it ownership of a big four U.S. broadcast network.” Less likely, perhaps, is any imminent deal affecting Trump’s sometimes-favorite all-news cable service, Fox News Channel, even as the business around it is shrinking. Though Fox News has long had cable TV’s oldest average viewership, it remains the most-watched, certainly among the three all-news competitors. But what would a Fox merger mean for CNN Worldwide, which is part of WBD? CNN’s cable network is habitually third in ratings these days, even as Chairman and CEO Mark Thompson continues to build up a thriving online side. The service tacked to the political center after the Warner Bros. Discovery merger 2.5 years ago, but still enrages Trump routinely. Is CNN headed to a private-equity spinoff or the sort of billionaire side project that has kept afloat (sometimes with plenty of controversy) such outlets as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Time, and The Atlantic? It’s even possible, Fishman wrote, that as Netflix continues to build out its ad-supported operations (still less than three years old), it may consider either launching or acquiring its own AVOD platform to go with its premium, first-run subscription shows. “We would not be surprised to see Netflix explore either launching their own FAST service or even acquiring an AVOD platform as advertising becomes a more meaningful driver of its revenue in the years ahead,” Fishman wrote. During the ARF’s OTT Conference, Nielsen’s SVP, Product Strategy & Thought Leadership Brian Fuhrer suggested that one underreported story is how well some media companies are integrating and cross-promoting programming across streaming, broadcast and cable. “A lot of people said you're giving too much of an advantage by zeroing in on streamers,” Fuhrer said in recounting the challenges Nielsen has had capturing viewership in its The Gauge reports. “For companies with assets in multiple categories, (critics said) you’re not showing how they stack up.” Indeed, over the summer, with children out of school and football out of season, four different media companies took turns at No. 1 in total viewership, most notably NBCUniversal and Peacock, which dominated August with record viewing of the Summer Olympics in Paris, and shifted its share of viewership by 4.9 points. “It's really pretty extraordinary,” Fuhrer said. “We'll be looking back on these Olympics as a use case for a long time to come. They really leaned into every asset they had and connected it to consumers. The ability to meet people where they are, in categories they want to use, that's one of the things people have under-appreciated. There's a halo effect back and forth. I think this is an underappreciated opportunity to understand what’s working here.” Streaming has become the way most viewers under 35 are watching “TV,” Fuhrer said. Streaming comprises about 80 percent of their view time, especially when gaming is removed from the analysis. Older audiences split their viewership more evenly across cable, broadcast and streaming. That analysis leaves out streaming-only Netflix and Youtube, as well as Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video. They’re doing just fine without those legacy linear operations, it would appear. But there’s hope, Fuhrer suggested, for the traditional media companies in Hollywood to do far better than they have. Broadcasting makes up about 22.6 percent of view time in the United States, while cable still attracts another 26.1 percent. Together, that’s less than half of viewtime these days, but still notable. What’s more remarkable, Fuhrer said, is the patterns that remain intact in peak viewing across platforms. The biggest viewership still happens on Super Bowl Sunday, New Year’s Eve and Thanksgiving. Football drives a lot of that. A Thursday Night Football game on Amazon Prime will generate between 2.3 billion and 2.9 billion live streaming minutes, Fuhrer said. He compared that to Netflix’s most watched series in September, The Perfect Couple, with about 500 million streaming minutes. “Football is really impactful and really different,” Fuhrer said. But what he called “The Netflix Effect” is expanding. By that, he was referring to the vast new audience Netflix generated when it licensed NBCUniversal’s decade-old cable hit Suits. Now other media companies are figuring out how to promote shows across all their distribution platforms. “Cross-platform promotion to reach non-viewers can work in both directions, linear to streaming and streaming to linear,” Fuhrer said. “The Netflix Effect isn't limited to Netflix anymore. The ability to promote streaming content to linear audiences, that's a valuable commodity and I think is under-appreciated.” While there’s hope here for a way out of the morass facing traditional studios, there’s still plenty of griping, as suggested by Needham & Co. Senior Analyst Laura Martin, based on a dinner she had with a group of senior Hollywood executives. Among the gripes, she wrote: “Streaming is a lousy business, compared with the linear TV bundle. Not only does it typically have only one (revenue) stream instead of two, but streaming's ad loads are well below linear TV, and its total (advertising revenues) are relatively small (typically around 10% of linear TV). Also, churn is MUCH higher for streaming than linear TV, where 2-3 year agreements were the norm. The transition from linear to streaming has been a material downdraft for economics for the traditional media companies, with no end in sight, they all agreed.” Not everything Netflix touches turns to gold, of course. The company’s new film chief, Dan Lin, is the latest to propose making fewer but better films, in contrast to predecessor Scott Stuber’s “stuff-the-pipeline” approach, epitomized by a post-pandemic plan to produce an eye-popping 70 films per year. That led to plenty of criticism about underdeveloped or copycat projects, perhaps inevitable with such an ambitious slate. Lin also is hoping to be more targeted in how Netflix spends its money, throwing fewer wads of upfront cash at big names while perhaps, perhaps, shifting away from its standard approach, and giving at least some talent a chance to share in the back-end profits of successful projects. Netflix is also reducing at least some ambitions on the game side, where it recently shut down a development studio focused on a AAA title. Netflix is hardly the only media company having game-industry headaches, with layoffs the past year affecting pretty much every major publisher. But it’s another area where the largess of the pandemic era and recovery has been significantly pulled back, and new priorities set. All of which suggests that even the victor in the Streaming Wars may still have some work to do to get ready for the next era of media in Hollywood. One Community. Many Voices.

Google is lowering the minimum amount of memory required for new Android TV devices… but increasing the amount needed for Google TV. The Mozilla Foundation is laying off a significant portion of its team. Microsoft plans to launch a preview of its controversial Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs by December. And the European Union is investigating whether Corning’s exclusivity deals with phone and tablet makers that use Gorilla Glass is a violation of antitrust rules. Here’s a roundup of recent tech news from around the web. Corning’s Gorilla Glass is used to offer protection for many, many phones and tablets. The EU wants to know if the exclusivity deals Corning has signed with device makers has made it difficult for rivals to compete in this space. Google has lowered the minimum amount of RAM needed for Android TV devices from 1.5 GB to 1GB, which should enable hardware makers to produce cheaper products. But Google TV (which is built on Android TV) requires 2GB (which is more than the latest Chromecast with Google TV HD has). The non-profit foundation behind the Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client is eliminating two divisions as part of the layoffs: advocacy for “privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies” and global programs. Nintendo says the upcoming game console will be backward compatible, meaning you should be able to play Switch games on the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s called). The Nintendo Switch Online service will also work with the new console. “Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date. This summer Fairphone launched an Android 14 update for the Fairphone 5 and said it would bring the update to the Fairphone 4 by September. Now the company says it’s taking longer than planned, and assistance from Qualcomm is needed. More details should be available by early 2025. Microsoft says the controversial Recall feature for Windows 11 will be available in preview for Copilot+ PCs by December. The company had delayed the launch in order to make changes in response to privacy & security concerns. Intel Lunar Lake chips feature on-package LPDDR5x-8533 memory which saves space and reduces latency and power consumption. But it also drives up the price, so Intel says it’s a one-off. Future Intel chips won’t have integrated RAM. Keep up on the latest headlines by following @[email protected] on Mastodon. You can also follow Liliputing on Threads, Facebook, and X.

Title: A new stronger Ozempic is coming. Here's what to know

Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.35%) teased some new details about a potential Ozempic successor during a call with investors Tuesday. The Danish pharma giant fielded several questions from interested analysts about its next-gen GLP-1 medication CagriSema, regarding its efficacy, safety, and supply chain. Novo Nordisk is known for its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company is working on a sequel. Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, with an amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose on average 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. However, Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange told analysts he has “confidence” that larger trials will show CagriSema will help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials to arrive at that number. The company said that results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected later this year and in the first half of 2025. Novo Nordisk said the safety and tolerability of this new drug is expected to be similar to current GLP-1 drugs on the market, based on previous trials. Novo Nordisk chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said the decision to externally outsource a component of the new drug was the “rational choice” based “on a consideration around capabilities and manufacturing footprints.” He added the company is learning from its experience producing current GLP-1 drugs. “We take historic learnings with us in terms of ensuring that we have a resilient setup into the future for external sourcing approaches,” Knudsen said. In the past few years, Novo Nordisk has failed to produce enough GLP-1 meds to meet demand, which has resulted in shortages. The company is now investing billions to increase its manufacturing capacity. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Amazon’s Andy Jassy denies its 5-day-a-week RTO plan is a secret way to reduce headcount
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/06/amazon-andy-jassy-5-day-rto-not-backdoor-layoff/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T18:52:36Z
Full Content:
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is demanding employees come into the office five days a week, but it’s not because he secretly wants them to quit, he said. Jassy announced the company’s strict return-to-office mandate in a September memo, sparking immediate outrage from employees, some of which had been working at least two days remotely per week since May 2023. Some experts have theorized that Jassy’s RTO plan could be a sneaky way of reducing the company’s headcount, rather than go through the formal process of conducting layoffs. Yet, in an all-hands meeting Tuesday, Jassy denied claims that the RTO plan was a “backdoor layoff” or that the company had reached some agreement with city leaders. “I can tell you both of those are not true. You know, this was not a cost play for us. This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture,” he said, according to a transcript reported by Reuters. Following the September RTO announcement, 73% of employees surveyed by anonymous job review site Blind said they had considered quitting in light of the new policy. Other employees quickly took to LinkedIn to change their status to #opentowork in hopes of finding a more flexible position. But in the company’s Amazon Web Services unit, CEO Matt Garman was clear that the naysayers could go elsewhere. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said on an internal call last month, referencing the company’s RTO policy, Reuters reported. To make clear their frustration with the RTO policy, hundreds of AWS employees signed a letter last month protesting the change, calling it an “outright abdication” of AWS’s role as an innovator and industry leader. To be sure, Amazon has offered employees commuter benefits and subsidized parking, among other perks to help ease the transition. In the memo from September, Jassy said it’s easier for employees to learn and collaborate while in person. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Amazon told Fortune the RTO plan is meant to strengthen the company’s culture and ensure teams are connected. The RTO memo asked workers to go back to “the way we were before the onset of COVID,” and banned working from home except for extraordinary circumstances. Jassy pointed out in the memo that intense coding work or having a sick child were appropriate times to work from home with manager consent. While managers earlier this year received approval to fire employees who didn’t comply with the previous three-day in-office mandate, many still made changes to their lives based on Amazon’s flexibility. In the Tuesday all-hands meeting, Jasssy acknowledged the five-day RTO policy, which takes effect in January, would take some getting used to. “It is an adjustment. I understand that for a lot of people, and we’re going to be working through that adjustment together,” Jassy said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Major U.S. indexes surged at midday Wednesday with former President Donald Trump set to return to the White House. The Dow jumped over 3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq added 2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury also climbed. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the social media company majority owned by Trump, jumped. Shares of companies that stand to benefit from higher interest rates and Trump’s plans to cut regulations also gained. Goldman Sachs (GS) was the best-performing stock in the Dow, with shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) higher as well. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) and other cryptocurrency-related firms took off as the price of Bitcoin hit a record high and other digital coins gained with Trump calling for the U.S. to be “the crypto capital of the planet.” Tesla (TSLA) shares hit their highest level in more than two years, after Trump called CEO Elon Musk “a genius” during his acceptance speech, with investors anticipating Musk’s support for the incoming president during the campaign could aid the electric vehicle maker. Meanwhile, shares of solar and other renewable energy companies slumped as Trump's campaign had called for the reversal of Biden administration policies favoring renewable energy. Enphase Energy (ENPH) and First Solar (FSLR) shares fell, along with shares of giant lithium miner Albemarle (ALB). Shares of Lennar (LEN) and rival home builders fell amid concerns higher borrowing costs could hurt new home sales. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares tumbled after the computer server maker missed sales estimates as it faces scrutiny over its accounting practices. Crude oil and gold futures fell, while the U.S. dollar advanced on the euro, pound, and yen. TradingView

Title: Super Micro Computer stock bleeds 24% after it can’t even say when it will post actual earnings

Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI-3.79%) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting. The company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. On Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value. For the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents. On Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May. Moreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. The company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.83% GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia is now worth more than Meta and Amazon combined. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI hype is in full throttle, as Nvidia is now the largest company in the world by market cap. With a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion, Nvidia has effectively dethroned Apple for the second time this year. This news follows developments in the stock market, with Nvidia's shares surging by 2.72% this morning. All top leaders had a bullish start to the day, but a 0.64% uptick wasn't enough for Apple to hold off the green storm. Nvidia now stands as the world's largest company by market cap, but will it be able to defend its position? If so, for how long? A deeper dive into Nvidia's stock shows that just one year ago, its market cap stood at roughly $1.1 trillion, netting us a 214% increase in the stock price within just 365 days. This is genuinely unprecedented growth, most of which can be attributed to Nvidia's ventures in the AI market as the chipmaker's accelerators continue to fuel the hype train. Q2 24 earnings show that Nvidia's revenue rose by 141% QOQ, increasing to $10.3 billion in data centers, while gaming was a measly 11% at $2.5 billion. With virtually every company planning to get a piece of the AI pie, they still require chips specifically tailored for Artificial Intelligence training and inference. Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based B100 and B200 GPUs are reportedly sold out for the next 12 months. Companies revolving around AI, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, you name it, are all in an arms race to procure the latest chips from Nvidia. AMD's CDNA3-based MI325X and the upcoming CDNA4-based MI355X could shake things up somewhat. For the time being, companies might still be inclined to prefer Nvidia due to its better software stack; however, more competition is good for evsuitablene - even multi-trillion-dollar conglomerates. The question boils down to mass-scale production since data centers and supercomputers require 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs, so it ultimately depends on whether either company can fulfill the required demand within the required time. These have been two very eventful years for not just Nvidia but its CEO, Jensen Huang, who is set to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering. Financially, consumer GPUs seem to be an afterthought for Nvidia, although leaks suggest that Nvidia is eying a January 2025 reveal for the much-anticipated RTX 50 series.

Title: Wegovy sales are slaying for Novo Nordisk right now

Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.35%) blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy continue to soar, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The Danish pharma giant posted its third-quarter earnings report early Wednesday morning and boasted sales figures blowing past analysts’ projections. “We are pleased with the performance in the first nine months of 2024. The sales growth is driven by increasing demand for our GLP-1-based diabetes and obesity treatments, and we are serving more patients than ever before,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement. Sales of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy skyrocketed 79% to 17.3 billion Danish Krone ($2.5 billion) in the third-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.37 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug beat analysts’ expectations of $2.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS+0.82%) Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+4.38%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world. However, due to their high retail price and skyrocketing demand, many patients have been having difficulty to get their hands on these treatments. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are both now working to increase their production of these meds and curb the sale of cheaper off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. Eli Lilly reported its third-quarter earnings last week, but its blockbuster weight-loss drug failed to meet expectations. Sales of Zepbound, which launched last November, reached $1.2 billion in sales in the third-quarter of 2024, below analysts’ expectations of $1.7 billion, according to FactSet.

Title: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D review: Maintaining its legendary title as the best gaming CPU with a slam dunk on Intel

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. AMD continues the theme with its second generation of 3D V-Cache to deliver unparalleled gaming performance and middling productivity. Thankfully, most gamers do not care about the benchmark-breaking number crunching as long as they get their framerate boosts, and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers that sweet extra FPS. It's not a big enough jump to tempt those happy with a previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but anyone on Ryzen 5000 chips or jumping ship from Intel will love it if the $30 MSRP hike and AM5 overhauls don't sour the temptation. Crushes Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming with a cheaper cost Compatible with most AM5 CPU coolers without new adapters Around 8-22% of generational performance increases Upgrading from 5000X3D means all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM $30 more expensive than its Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor 7800X3D users could wait for the next generation with bigger gains Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. I can tell you that extra cores and threads benefit raw productivity performance, but I'll always feel the temptation of a gaming-centric CPU that delivers boosted framerates, something AMD has repeatedly delivered with its -X3D chips. • Price and availability• CPU benchmarks• Gaming benchmarks• Competition• Should you buy? It's a simple fact that consistently proves itself with each processor generation: gamers want the best performance for their money and will take any desktop boosts as a convenient side effect. AMD has remained in the top-seller spot for most CPU retailers, with the previous-generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D sitting pretty as the gaming champion since its release. If that were ever to change, it'd be with a direct successor, and that's the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, here at last. While I've tested processors from both Intel and AMD, my personal PCs have always used AMD Ryzen chips for modern builds and even AMD Athlon 64 many years before that. I've watched them evolve and still choose them for myself. At its launch, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the only Zen 5 processor in AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D range. More variants, presumably (but so far unconfirmed) a 9900X3D and 9950X3D, are expected to follow. Price: $479 at Newegg Release: November 7, 2024 Cores: 8 Threads: 16 Base clock: 4.7GHz Max boost: Up to 5.2GHz L3 cache: 96MB Base TDP: 120W The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an 8-core, 16-thread APU (SoC) running at a 120W base TDP like its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Its specs are also similar to AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X chip, which runs at a lower TDP with a reduced L3 cache, focused on productivity rather than gaming. Officially launching with a $479 MSRP, which is $30 more expensive than the $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D it replaces, actual store listings come relatively close with some minor inflation. AMD has moved from a 4nm process to 5nm via TSMC's foundry but remains on the same AM5 socket with compatible 9000X3D motherboards and supports the same CPU coolers as its previous-gen Zen 4 (7000 Series) chips. Upgrading from a Ryzen 7000X3D chip would be a straightforward process for enthusiasts. Still, it wouldn't provide as much of a performance leap as it would for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D or similar AM4 variants using now-incompatible DDR4 memory modules (RAM) as AM5 requires DDR5. AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D | $479 at Newegg The new Ryzen 7 9800X3D becomes the best gaming CPU you can buy, surpassing the current category champion and crushing its top-end Intel competitor. 👉See at: Best Buy | Newegg | Amazon | B&H Having previously tested AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 8000 Series processors like the Ryzen 5 8600G and Ryzen 7 8700G, I already had access to a compatible AM5-socket motherboard with the ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A Gaming WiFi. However, AMD provided all-new samples to ensure compatibility with the latest BIOS software and EXPO-compatible RAM running at 6000MHz. Arctic sent its Liquid Freezer III 360mm AIO to help test a separate processor, but it still offers the best cooling performance here.

The companies did not see the contents of the review before publishing. No matter what a processor was designed for, it always passes my usual gamut of synthetic benchmarks that test single-core and multi-core performance in various productivity tasks. As fun as it would be to skip right to the gaming tests, it's important to see where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D ranks among its peers in burst processing and longer, sustained stress tests. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9800X3D scores above its lower-powered non-X3D sibling, the $359 Ryzen 7 9700X, in multi-core performance but below in single-core equivalents. In synthetic productivity benchmarks, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D performed around 21-22% faster than its predecessor, the 7800X3D. Of particular note is how far ahead Intel's $589 Core Ultra 9 285K pulls in multi-core tests, as by design, but there isn't much of a gap in the single-core category — remember this when I compare gaming performance next. Otherwise, there's about a 22% generational burst performance improvement over AMD's predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Sustained stress tests with Cinebench 2024 show a similar story, with the 9800X3D scoring slightly ahead of the Ryzen 7 9700X as before while creeping on the heels of Intel's $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. In the long run, single-core performance falls in favor of Intel, with more of a lead gained by the Core Ultra 9 285K as it once again places miles ahead in multi-core equivalents, dominating productivity by a colossal degree. Again, a 21% generational sustained performance over the 7800X3D matches the burst tests. In its official documentation for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, AMD touts an average 8% performance improvement in gaming compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The amount depends on a range of engine-specific quirks that determine how CPU-bound or GPU-bound a title can be, though the percentage gap usually increases over time with post-launch driver updates. Nevertheless, the 7800X3D, until now, was the best gaming CPU available, so these improvements are no real surprise — so, it's far more interesting to compare the 9800X3D against Intel's top-end CPU: the Core Ultra 9 285K. While writing my Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review, no graphical setting changes would significantly increase my FPS in Forza Horizon 5. While it's likely a bug, this chart accurately represents the best framerate I can achieve at this time with the 'High' preset at 1080p. Matching estimations, Black Myth: Wukong scores almost identically on AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, while the "121.9%" gains promised in the CPU-centric title Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation didn't manifest in my testing, sticking around 6% instead. While not much of a surprise given its excellent performance on practically any hardware, Forza Horizon 5 scores an outrageous average of 387 FPS, which is perfect for anyone who uses those 360Hz 1080p gaming monitors. However, something clearly is bugged on Intel's side, so I'm skipping the implied percentage gain for Forza. Moving from a disastrous launch to a patched-up marvel, Cyberpunk 2077 sees a 52% performance increase on the 9800X3D over Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, proving far better of a pairing to NVIDIA's current high-end GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. Far Cry 6 bumps up performance by 43% with the same GPU and DDR5-6000 RAM pairing, and the latest blockbuster Call of Duty entry enjoys a 41% lead as the 9800X3D earns extra frames in Black Ops 6. So, while I'm testing a tighter scope of popular AAA titles on PC, I still saw around a 36% performance increase in gaming with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Naturally, my number would be lower if I only tested games closer to the 100% to 110% range of AMD's generational game performance chart, but seeing visually-rich megahits like Call of Duty and Cyberpunk 2077 score such significant increases is reassuring for the performance of a brand-new processor at day one. Yes, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy, taking over from its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. 96MB of second-generation 3D V-Cache in the Zen 5 architecture helps push for higher FPS (frames per second) in games than Intel's top-end Core Ultra 9 285K, a rival processor that features more cores and threads, a higher clock speed, and slightly higher TDP. Ultimately, Intel's more expensive CPU offers better multi-core performance in productivity tasks and synthetic benchmarks, but AMD wins in gaming performance. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D has three significant competitors, though only two would be taken seriously by anyone on a budget. Internally, Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K stands against AMD's gaming CPU simply because it's the most powerful chip in the latest Core Ultra Series 200S range. However, this 24-core, 24-thread carries a price tag of around $589 to $630 and targets an entirely different audience who prioritizes energy efficiency within a productivity-centric software suite. Gaming performance on Intel's side remains relatively unchanged from its last-gen Core i9-14900K, which offered similar performance to its i9-13900K predecessor and suffered from an overarching microcode launch bug that was later fixed for the continued manufacturing of 14th Gen chips. Still, listings for the Core i9-14900K sit around $440 as AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D is ready to launch, making it an attractive option since some of its best motherboards support an established LGA 1700 socket with wide DDR4 and DDR5 RAM support, bringing down the overall cost of a custom build. The other major competitor is a call from inside Team Red's house, as the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D doesn't fall far enough behind the new 9800X3D to warrant an upgrade from anyone who already has one. On the other hand, those who already adopted the AM5 socket with all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM could happily swap out their processor for this new replacement without buying any extra components, but dropping almost $500 on an 8-22% potential performance gain isn't so tempting. So, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D stands as a more logical upgrade path for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D from 2022. Still, this lumps users with the mandatory motherboard and RAM upgrades, though most AM4-compatible CPU coolers will work with AM5 replacements, so it's not entirely damaging to your budget. The bright side is that you'll feel a more significant boost if you upgrade from the 5800X3D, with compatibility for PCIe 5.0 (Gen 5), unlocking faster storage options with the CPU bump. Overall, it's a sticky situation because the only people who will see the most significant benefits are the ones doomed to spend extra cash on a total rig overhaul. ✅ You want the absolute best gaming CPU on the market. ✅ You crave the highest framerate count possible for high-FPS gameplay. ❌ You're already using a Ryzen 7 7800X3D or high-end 14th Gen Core i9. ❌ You rely on productivity apps that demand the best multi-core performance. Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a hot pick for those willing to upgrade, taking over from the 7800X3D as the best gaming CPU and beating Intel's top offering.

Amazon is pushing ahead with its RTO policy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Not long after hundreds of Amazon workers signed a petition against the company’s proposed five-day return-to-office policy, company CEO Andy Jassy has denied claims the mandate was introduced to quietly push workers away. At a recent all-hands meeting (via CNBC), Jassy rejected claims the RTO policy is a “backdoor layoff,” adding the push for in-person working would reinforce Amazon’s culture. The news comes after a September 2024 announcement detailing the new full-time RTO plans, set to be enacted from January 2, 2025. “A number of people I’ve seen theorize that the reason we were doing this is a backdoor layoff or we made some sort of deal with the city, or cities, and that’s why we were having people come back and be together more often," Jassy declared. The reaction from Amazon workers is understandable, given the company has laid off around 27,000 workers since tech redundancies skyrocketed in 2022. Signed by around 500 workers, the recent petition against the company’s RTO mandate alleged that AWS CEO Matt Garman’s claims many workers were on board with the change were incorrect. Prior to that, Garman also reportedly told workers unhappy with the change to consider leaving the company altogether. Up from the current three-day policy, the change to full-time office hours marks a significant shift in the tech sector. Many of Amazon’s rivals are still working on three-day mandates.

Just like Amazon, LGBTQ dating app Grindr recently faced criticism about its RTO policy. Although the specific details about its RTO policy are unconfirmed, workers alleged that they were given two weeks to relocate nearer to a hub.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait. READ ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. “The AI theme is intact if you’re the mega caps,” as companies show that they can monetize their investments while maintaining existing profitability. As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies. As companies ramp up their spending on AI, let’s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results. “Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.” The company’s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements. In other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks. “Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.” – CEO Niv Braun Talking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California’s attorney general’s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American technology company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. This AI chip play is one of the leading players designing chips for companies that are building AI data centers. On November 5th, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced major innovations, services, and partnerships aimed at accelerating and optimizing enterprise AI workloads. The company has introduced “VeloRAIN”, a new AI-powered networking architecture, along with two high-performance edge appliances and even a partner program called Titan that will support enterprise AI workloads beyond data centers. “VeloRAIN is the foundation of our AI networking innovation, empowering our entire portfolio to better address the demands of enterprise AI workloads. By harnessing the advanced capabilities of VeloRAIN, AI workloads from distributed inferencing and agentic peer-to-peer applications to upstream heavy RAG transactions will see improved application-based QoE and security across all endpoints of the enterprise. We look forward to collaborating with our global partner ecosystem via Titan, our new partner program to provide more enterprises with the next generation of infrastructure necessary to support such current and future AI workloads.” Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note (10Y=F), meanwhile, rose 16 basis points to trade around 4.4%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied to a record alongside a surge in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) as the evening's returns bolstered the "Trump trade." Outside of the presidential election, Republicans have also flipped the Senate. Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to "seek common ground" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. American voters gave Donald Trump a commanding victory, powered in large part by an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident for years. But Trump's key campaign promise of new tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants could put new upward pressure on prices, the very issue that appears to have powered him to a win. A note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that as a result, “We are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.” Read here for more about what Trump could mean on the key economic issue of price pressures, as well as taxes.= US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A recent call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning confirmed the victory. After a steady rally in stock futures overnight as Harris' path to victory narrowed, futures tied to the three major averages built on earlier jumps on the news. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Meanwhile, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RTY=F) were up more than 6.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is pushing higher as investors bet on a faster pace of inflation under new Trump tariffs, and a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Fed. “Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points off of GDP in 2025 and 2026). For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth,” TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley said. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to around 4.26% early on Wednesday. For now, markets are taking this move in yields in stride. But keep in mind this is a market that loves prospects of more rate cuts. If that thesis gets pushed aside under Trump as tariffs spur new inflation, markets could recalibrate to the downside. Global stock markets had a mixed reaction to the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, as the Republican closed in on a second term in the White House. In China, stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with Shanghai's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) closing 0.5% lower, and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI) down 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. But Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 (^N225) climbed 2.6%, while the broader Topix (0P00006NXB.T) stock index gained 1.9%. The rally came as the Japanese yen (JPY=X) sank to its lowest since July and the dollar (USD=X) strengthened. Europe's major stock gauges jumped in early trade. London's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) moved up 1.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) benchmark rose 1.6% as Frankfurt's DAX (^GDAXI) and Paris's CAC 40 (^FCHI) gained. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in premarket trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. A win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in pole position to shape the EV maker's future, given his strong backing of Trump — or at least, that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. "This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before," he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. "[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country." The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.

Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged as much as 25% before paring gains in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Donald Trump edging ahead of Kamala Harris in the latest election results. All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares hinges on "a buy the rumor, sell the fact" trading strategy. Read more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts "I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down," he surmised. "If he loses, I think it goes to zero." Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock "life of its own." "It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction," he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, making his share worth billions. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Title: Should You Pick META Stock At $560?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/05/should-you-pick-meta-stock-at-560/

AUSTIN, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, the Instagram logo is displayed on a ... [+] computer screen on September 18, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo illustration by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it’s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn’t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what’s happening with Google stock. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company’s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. What didn’t sit well with the investors was the company’s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company’s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure. META stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.
