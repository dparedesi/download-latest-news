Ethereum’s institutional narrative is strengthening as US-based Spot ETF trackers witnessed another week of inflows last week. BlackRock’s ETHA fund captured the majority of this activity with more than half a billion dollars in new investments, while other ETFs struggled with minor outflows. At the same time, technical patterns are aligning with this buying pressure, which has given many analysts confidence that the Ethereum price could be preparing to push towards its all-time high in the coming weeks. Last week was another positive week for Spot Ethereum ETFs. Across all issuers in the US, Spot Ethereum ETFs added $556.92 million in inflows during the week, making it the second consecutive week of positive institutional inflows. Cumulative inflows since launch are now over $13.9 billion, and these ETFs now hold $29.64 billion worth of Ethereum. Interestingly, data from Farside Investor’s Spot ETF tracker reveal that the majority of last week’s institutional inflows went into BlackRock’s ETHA. The inflow numbers show that BlackRock’s ETHA product absorbed roughly $513 million in net inflows between September 15 and 19. The largest portion came on Monday with over $360 million, followed by another $140 million inflow as the week drew to a close on Friday, which was enough to offset corresponding outflows from every other issuer that day. This shows how investors continue to favor BlackRock’s offering as the primary gateway for regulated Ethereum exposure. Other issuers experienced a more mixed week. Fidelity’s FETH product posted sharp redemptions, most notably $53.4 million in outflows on Friday, September 19. However, these outflows were partially balanced by $159.4 million in inflows on Thursday. Bitwise and Grayscale also witnessed days of inflows, which was enough to cancel out minor outflows during the week. Spot Ethereum ETF Flows: Farside Investors Another week of institutional inflow could set the stage for bullish price action in the new week, which in turn would certify a bullish monthly close for Ethereum in September. In fact, analyses from different analysts have looked at multiple bullish patterns forming across different timeframes on the Ethereum price chart. One particularly notable observation came from VasilyTrader on the TradingView platform, who highlighted encouraging signals on Ethereum’s shorter-term charts. His analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe suggested that the recent pullback has now given way to a bullish confirmation. He identified a clear double bottom pattern that formed early last week, which was followed by a breakout from a falling wedge formation by Friday’s close. Based on these developments, VasilyTrader set his next price target at no less than $4,741. Chart Image From TradingView: VasilyTrader At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,485. According to crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, ETH is still on track to reach $5,000 as long as it holds above $4,400.

Search The Points Guy Generated by AI with support from our editorial team. Nearly a year after Hurricane Helene rocked the southeastern U.S., the famed Blue Ridge Parkway — and many stops along its 469-mile route — is almost fully open again. This serpentine, two-lane ribbon of blacktop follows the twisting spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains (a subrange of the Appalachians) from Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. With a speed limit of 45 mph, the Blue Ridge Parkway sacrifices directness for mile after mile of untamed alpine beauty. You can hop on and off at countless junctions along the route, including two attractive midsize cities: Asheville, North Carolina (also open and welcoming tourists) and Roanoke, Virginia. But if you're up for a grand adventure and can spare a few days, it's well worth driving the entire parkway. You'll encounter remarkable diversions along the way: hundreds of scenic viewpoints and picnic spots, miles of hiking trails for every skill level and a bounty of engaging historic sites that shed light on Appalachian heritage and folkways. From south to north, here's a look at some of the most memorable stops along this magical road and helpful planning tips to get you started. Related: Not just for flights: Using points and miles to save on road trips The nearest airport to the parkway's southern tip, in the Great Smoky Mountains, is Knoxville, Tennessee's McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS), a two-hour drive. Of major airports, Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) is a good option if you are planning a round-trip car rental. It's just 3 1/2 hours from the parkway's southern end point and a 4 1/2-hour drive (by the faster interstate highways) from the northern end point, at the entrance of Shenandoah. Atlanta is also 3 1/2 hours from the south end of the parkway, and the drive up through Georgia's Appalachian Mountains is quite beautiful. It's a great way to extend your adventure. From the north end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, Dulles International Airport (IAD) near Washington, D.C., is a 2 1/2-hour drive. Although there's no fee to drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, you'll need to pay $30 per private vehicle to enter Shenandoah National Park (unless you have a park pass), and Great Smoky Mountains National Park charges parking fees.

The scenery along the parkway really sings anytime from spring through fall, but May through mid-June stands out especially for viewing wildflowers and rhododendrons in bloom, and mid-September through mid-October is best for admiring brilliant fall foliage. Temperatures along the parkway tend to be five to 10 degrees lower than in the region's lower elevations, making this drive a potentially cool escape from summer heat. On the other hand, this means snow and ice are possible in winter, the one season when many facilities along the road are closed. Keep in mind that this curving and relatively narrow road is prone to fog and wild animal crossings at any time of year. It's best to drive it only during daylight hours, both for safety and the best views, and to exercise caution during heavy rain. How long does this road trip take? It's theoretically possible to drive the entire route in three days, but you'll have a far more enjoyable experience if you allow five days at a leisurely pace. With a full week, you'll have more than enough time to explore Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah national parks, too. The Blue Ridge Parkway begins close to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This rugged 522,419-acre swath of pristine forests, open meadows and meandering streams is the largest national park east of the Mississippi. In a single day, you can ascend to the observation tower atop 6,643-foot Clingmans Dome and explore the open-air Mountain Farm Museum — or head to the Tennessee section of the park to drive the enchanting Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail and hop out for a short trek to Grotto Falls. Once you enter the parkway, you have about 90 miles ahead of you to Asheville. This section has some of the most dramatic scenic pullouts along the entire route, with Waterrock Knob (milepost 451) a particular highlight. There are a small visitor center and a picnic area, and the views are incredible at sunset. The other stop worth noting is Mount Pisgah (milepost 408). Allow a couple of hours for the steep but well-trodden 2.6-mile round-trip hike to this 5,721-foot peak that offers a vast panorama of nearby Asheville. After being ravaged by Hurricane Helene, the small city of Asheville is back and better than ever. With a fantastic culinary and craft beer scene and a thriving artist community, Asheville has enough to keep you busy for several days, including two notable stops along the parkway: the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center, with its engrossing exhibits on the road's natural and human history, and the superb Folk Art Center (particularly Allanstand Craft Shop). In Asheville itself, set aside time to explore the greenery of The North Carolina Arboretum, peruse the galleries of the hip River Arts District (or even try your hand at an art class) and eat your way through buzzy food-and-drink neighborhoods like South Slope and West Asheville. With its chateauesque, 250-room mansion, splendid gardens and numerous other diversions, Biltmore Estate is another must — but you really need a full day to make the most of visiting this 8,000-acre property (admission starts at $70 per person). Although there are no accommodations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you'll find a good selection in the gateway towns of Cherokee, North Carolina (just 4 miles from the start of the Blue Ridge Parkway) and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These mostly include no-frills options like Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites Cherokee (rates start at $96 or 29,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night this fall) and Econo Lodge Inn & Suites Gatlinburg at the Convention Center (starting from $52 or 20,000 Choice Privileges points per night). Asheville offers the greatest range of points hotels along the Blue Ridge Parkway. For instance, Blind Tiger Asheville, a charming bed-and-breakfast establishment in a 19th-century Queen Anne house that's part of World of Hyatt's Mr & Mrs Smith collection, has nightly rates starting at $202 or 27,000 points this fall. Or, you could book The Radical Asheville, a hip, art-inspired Hilton Honors property in the heart of the River Arts District, starting from $141 or 45,000 points per night. Related: Best road trips for visiting national parks Just northeast of Asheville, Craggy Gardens Picnic Area (milepost 364) is a shaded tract of outdoor tables with trails leading to magnificent stands of azaleas and mountain laurels. About 10 miles later, you can briefly detour up a side road to the summit of the highest point in the eastern U.S.: Mount Mitchell. A short, paved path leads to the observation deck, and there are a small museum and a casual restaurant, too. At milepost 305, you'll approach Grandfather Mountain, which offers rocky peaks you can explore by walking across a dramatic mile-high swinging bridge. Here, you'll also drive along the parkway's greatest engineering marvel, the Linn Cove Viaduct, a curving, 1,243-foot-long concrete bridge that hugs Grandfather Mountain's precipitous face. Nearby at Julian Price Memorial Park, you can rent a kayak or canoe for a refreshing paddle around Price Lake. Also check out the quaint village center of Blowing Rock, with its gift and crafts shops, as well as the interesting Blowing Rock Art & History Museum. The charming town of Blowing Rock currently has one points hotel: Holiday Inn Express Blowing Rock South, where rates this fall start from $83 or 18,000 IHG One Rewards points per night. Other notable options include the woodsy-chic Mountainaire Inn & Log Cabins (starting around $134 per night), bookable through Chase Travel℠, and the alpine chalet-inspired Switzerland Inn (starting around $109 per night), available on Capital One Travel. Related: How the Capital One Venture X travel credit can save you $300 on your next trip As you approach Virginia, stop for lunch at the parkway's oldest eatery, The Bluffs (milepost 238), a restored 1940s rustic-style diner known for fried chicken lunches. Then, take a walk around nearby Brinegar Cabin, a small late-19th-century homestead that's typical of those that once proliferated in these mountains. Highlights after crossing the state line include the easy 2-mile-loop waterfall hike at Cumberland Knob (milepost 218) and the nearby outdoor Blue Ridge Music Center, which stages folk and country concerts throughout the summer. At historic Mabry Mill (milepost 176), you can watch docents working in the historic sawmill and blacksmith shop and dine in the colorful restaurant (known for its freshly baked blackberry cobbler). You'll encounter the turnoff for picturesque Mill Mountain Greenway, which leads into Roanoke, at milepost 120. Stop at Mill Mountain Park for a grand view of the city, save time for a walk through the small zoo and garden, if possible, on your way into town. Give yourself at least a half day to get to know this bustling hill city with several first-rate attractions, including the Taubman Museum of Art, which is focused on regional American works, and the O. Winston Link Museum, with its railway photography housed inside a vintage train station. Pick up locally sourced food at Historic Roanoke City Market, and hunt for Appalachian antiques and architectural wares at famed Black Dog Salvage. Roanoke makes for a convenient overnight base, and it offers a few lodging options bookable with points. The Hotel Roanoke & Conference Center stands out for its 1880s Tudor-style design and its refined restaurant serving French cuisine with a Southern twist. You can book it for as low as $194 or 58,000 Hilton Honors points per night this fall. And you can get solid value for your World of Hyatt points at the Category 1 Hyatt Place Roanoke Airport/Valley View Mall (from $94 or 3,500 points per night). From Roanoke, you have about 115 miles left to go. Make time for a detour into the cute hamlet of Buchanan, Virginia, where you can venture across a vintage swinging bridge over the James River, and stop for a hike along one of the easy but rewarding trails at the Peaks of the Otter area (milepost 86). At milepost 0, the Blue Ridge Parkway ends on an overpass above Interstate Highway 64. Or, to be more precise, it transitions into Skyline Drive, the 105-mile scenic route through Shenandoah National Park. This curvaceous and lofty thoroughfare feels quite similar to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The main difference is that the speed limit is lower (35 mph), and you'll pay a $30-per-vehicle fee to enter the park (unless you hold an America the Beautiful Pass or visit on a fee-free day). Related: 10 of the best national parks to visit in the fall If you're ending your trip at the parkway's northern terminus, it's an easy drive on I-64 to Staunton, Virginia (20 minutes west) or Charlottesville, Virginia (30 minutes east), which offer a few points hotels. For example, the Avid Hotel Staunton is available from $92 or 19,000 IHG One Rewards points per night this fall, and Hyatt Place Charlottesville starts at $110 or 8,000 World of Hyatt points per night. If continuing along Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park, consider staying in one of its handful of hotels. Some of these are available on various credit card travel portals, but they fill up fast, so book ahead. There's something special about waking up in a room high atop the park's 3,500-foot-elevation spine, with panoramic views west toward the Allegheny Mountains. Now that most major repairs have been made in the wake of Hurricane Helene, the Blue Ridge Parkway has reopened for road trips — and fall is a prime time to go. Besides everything mentioned above, you'll enjoy the added benefit of spectacular fall foliage during your drive and any hikes you take. If leaf peeping is your aim, you'll have the best chance at seeing peak colors if you drive the parkway between mid-October and early November.

As Strategy continues to amass Bitcoin with the appetite of a hungry hippo, just how much is too much for a single entity to hold? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. On Wall Street and Crypto Twitter, few names spark debate like Michael Saylor and his Bitcoin-hungry software company, Strategy. Gone are the days when MicroStrategy was just a business intelligence software vendor. Today, “Strategy” stands as the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder, packing away more than 638,900 BTC (3% of the total circulating supply). For some Bitcoiners, Saylor’s conviction is a validation of the king of crypto’s coming-of-age as an institutional reserve asset. For critics, it’s a warning: centralization risk, wrapped in a narrative. So, where does the truth lie, and just how much supply is too much for any single entity? It wasn’t always clear this day would come. In the early days, Bitcoin was for nerdy devs, quasi-religious cypherpunks, and early adopters. Today, one NASDAQ-listed firm sits atop a pile of digital gold that overshadows that of BlackRock, Tesla, and Coinbase combined. It’s not just about numbers. As Nic Puckrin, CEO and founder at Coin Bureau, points out: “Having a NASDAQ-listed firm owning such a large allocation of BTC shows that Bitcoin has moved from the fringe to the spotlight of mainstream corporate finance… For institutions still hesitant, Strategy’s holdings act as a powerful signal, telling others that a publicly traded firm can allocate billions of dollars to BTC, and so can you.” Bitcoin has firmly entered the institutional era. For treasuries and pension funds searching for alternatives to cash, Strategy’s lead acts as a proof-of-concept. But this milestone also swings the conversation back to first principles. Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized network, immune to the grip of any single company, country, or billionaire. What happens when one firm not only holds a massive position but relentlessly targets more? Saylor has alluded to ambitions as high as 7% of the total supply on numerous occasions. Make no mistake, Strategy’s holdings have shifted market dynamics. The float is tighter, and with so much supply boxed up in long-term corporate treasuries, the supply shock theory is very real. And that’s a double-edged sword. Tony Yazbeck, cofounder of The Bitcoin Way, comments: “MicroStrategy owning over 3% of Bitcoin isn’t a threat to the network itself, but it does carry some market implications. The main concern is influence. As a large holder, he may be able to sway sentiment and trigger price swings.” For institutional Bitcoin evangelists, Strategy’s success is a green light, the mainstream embrace they’ve argued for since Bitcoin’s early days. Investment veteran and e-Cobalt founder Mitchell DiRaimondo says: “Others will catch on, and when they do, 3% will seem like just the beginning of a much larger shift in capital.” DiRaimondo sees Saylor’s conviction as transformative: “His approach has always been solid: stock up on hard money, ignore the noise, and get ready for long-term adoption.” While Puckrin also celebrates Strategy’s achievement, he warns that cascading liquidations could be a real threat: “Despite the positivity, we can’t ignore the clear risks here… If, for any reason, Strategy is forced to liquidate even a fraction of its holdings, the impact on market confidence would be profound.” And that risk isn’t just theoretical. The last few years have seen failed treasury plays, sudden liquidations, and gut-wrenching moments when Bitcoin’s price fell off a cliff triggered by the actions of a few unscrupulous firms. FTX anyone? What are the other risks of concentrated holdings? As long-time Bitcoin advocate and security expert Jameson Lopp previously told Slate Sundays: “If too much Bitcoin gets concentrated in too few hands, we run the risk of essentially recreating a highly centralized system.” That’s why Lopp decided to invest in David Bailey’s Bitcoin Treasury company, Nakamoto, to prevent Strategy from pulling so much further ahead. “It’s not because I think that corporate Bitcoin treasury adoption is the best thing since sliced bread. It’s because I felt like we needed to have a broader and more diverse group of corporate treasuries to compete with Saylor, to try to slow down how much he can continue accumulating.” Bitcoin was built to withstand centralized attacks, but the question isn’t whether one company can break Bitcoin. It’s about how market perception changes when one player becomes the story. Wes Kaplan, former Cointelegraph CEO and current CEO of G-Knot, comments: “Unlike individual holders who sell gradually, these entities operate with fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders and creditors. When market stress hits, these companies can face margin calls and creditor demands regardless of their Bitcoin conviction. Multiple leveraged players selling simultaneously could create cascading liquidations.” This isn’t just about market drama. It’s about dilution, fragility, and interconnected risk. Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch Network, sees the bigger picture, questioning how the centralization of the Bitcoin supply affects miners. He notes: “As more trading migrates to ETFs, centralized venues, and OTC desks, fewer coins actually settle on-chain. That siphons liquidity from the on-chain market that funds miners via fees. With block subsidies shrinking, a durable fee market is what keeps miners profitable, and a broad mining base is key to Bitcoin’s decentralization.” Macro analyst and Bitcoin advocate Lyn Alden holds a different view. She’s not concerned about the centralization of the Bitcoin supply, pointing out that the dynamics have always been this way: Mt. Gox had over 800,000 coins, a bigger percentage than BlackRock or Strategy has now. Alden looks to leverage as the main culprit for systems to unravel, telling Slate Sundays: “MicroStrategy has pretty low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. Metaplanet has relatively low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. We’ll see how the others come as they go. I certainly think that we’ll see a washout. We’ll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.” Alden’s thoughts are echoed by OG Bitcoiner, CEO, and cofounder of BitcoinOS, Edan Yago. He says: “I don’t see Strategy’s move of buying BTC as a problem. In fact, it reflects a long-term alignment with Bitcoin’s principles. Unlike speculative holders, this puts a lot of BTC in the hands of a long-term holder. Strategy is showing the world that Bitcoin is an institutional-grade treasury asset. This provides a stability that creates stronger demand dynamics and actually makes Bitcoin’s supply more resilient.” Mudano’s take is somewhat more cautious, reminding Bitcoiners to see the bigger picture rather than get blinded by NGU. “Cheer conviction buyers like Saylor, but watch the plumbing: how encumbered those holdings are, who the custodians are, and whether miners’ fee share of revenue is rising. Deep on‑chain activity, not just big holders, is what ultimately secures the network.” 2025 is a certainly a year of inflection for Bitcoin. Strategy remains the largest non-sovereign treasury by a country mile. Metaplanet in Japan is stacking BTC as “Asia’s MicroStrategy.” And Nakamoto is grabbing headlines with the annihilation of its shares, down a horrifying 96% from their May highs. Meanwhile, governments, ETFs, and exchanges now command close to a third of all circulating Bitcoin supply, and data from Glassnode shows that only 14-15% of Bitcoin is truly liquid, adding gravity to every move by the major players. The risk? Systemic fragility if one or two whales face margin calls or liquidity constraints. Are we building the very vulnerabilities that Bitcoin was designed to eliminate? Counterparty risk, custody structures, and treasury strategies will all face their moment of truth. So, is Strategy’s position good or bad? The answer, as ever, is nuanced. For some, it’s the clearest sign yet that Bitcoin is maturing; a reserve-grade asset fit for institutional balance sheets. For others, it’s a warning to stay vigilant about concentration, transparency, and systemic risk. As Yago points out: “Bitcoin thrives because it’s held by those who understand its scarcity and value… Bitcoin cannot be ‘controlled’ by one entity… It is designed to be completely decentralized, and ownership concentration does not change that.” What matters most? Not whether one company can buy its way to dominance, but whether ownership (and stewardship) remains diverse. The ethos that started this revolution was decentralization. If corporate and sovereign funds dominate the ledger, Bitcoin’s next chapter will depend on how they wield their power and what happens when the tides inevitably turn. Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation, succinctly sums up the mood: “Let’s remember why we are here Cypherpunks write code Thank an open-source developer today Wall Street didn’t create and sustain NGU, Satoshi and the cypherpunks did and will” In the end, Bitcoin’s resilience won’t be measured by how much Strategy owns, but by how well the ecosystem adapts, expanding supply across corporates, institutions, and individuals. That’s what keeps Bitcoin true to form, and what will define whether it remains the people’s money… or the plaything of the corporate elite.

YZi Labs, the family office founded by Binance co-founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao and Yi He, which was rebranded from Binance Labs, has expanded its position in Ethena Labs, the protocol behind USDe, which has become the third-largest U.S. dollar-denominated crypto asset with more than $13 billion in circulation. The investment comes as Ethena enters a new stage of growth, which includes extending its footprint on BNB Chain. This includes rolling out products designed to bridge crypto and traditional finance, such as USDtb, a fiat-backed stablecoin in development, and Converge, an institutional settlement layer being built with Securitize and partners connected to BlackRock. USDe, marketed as a "synthetic dollar," uses bitcoin BTC, ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL (SOL)as backing assets, pairing them with an equal value of short perpetual futures positions on exchanges to maintain a $1 peg. Launched less than two years ago, the synthetic dollar crossed the $10 billion supply milestone faster than any other dollar-pegged crypto asset. “Since our investment team first met Guy [Young] in late 2023, Ethena has become the category definer for yield-bearing synthetic dollars,” said Dana Hou, investment partner at YZi Labs. For users, the developments mean more options for holding and using digital dollars across centralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols. For institutions, products like Converge aim to create a familiar settlement layer for tokenized assets, potentially broadening adoption of on-chain financial infrastructure.

Title: Ethereum ETFs Register $557 Million Inflows As BlackRock Leads The Charge

Time Published: 2025-09-21T11:00:06Z

According to data from SoSoValue, the Ethereum spot ETFs saw another strong week of bullish trading activity in the third week of September, recording $556.92 million in net inflows. While the figure is slightly below the $637.79 million inflows registered during the second week, the performance underscores sustained investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated institutional vehicles. Despite the rocky start to the month, marked by $787.74 million in net outflows during the first week of September, Ethereum ETFs have now swung back into positive territory, with a cumulative September net deposit of $406.97 million. In analyzing the Ethereum ETFs’ performance for the last week, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) continues to establish itself as the dominant player, after recording an impressive $513.01 million in net inflows, i.e, more than 92% of total ETH ETF inflows. With this momentum, BlackRock’s ETHA now holds $13.40 billion in cumulative inflows and $17.09 billion in net assets under management (AUM), reinforcing its position as the clear market leader. In usual fashion, other funds lagged well behind in comparison. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) posted a distant second with $17.99 million in net inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $15.18 million. Other ETFs with significant traction included Grayscale’s legacy ETHE trust, which added $13.60 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW, which attracted $7.52 million. However, not all funds shared in the positive momentum as VanEck’s ETHV lost $8.16 million while Invesco’s QETH saw a minor $1.73 million in outflows, highlighting uneven performance across the sector. Taken together, all Ethereum ETFs now report $29.64 billion in total net assets, supported by $13.29 billion in cumulative inflows. The latest numbers demonstrate that despite volatility in ETH spot prices and mixed performance among smaller ETFs, overall institutional demand for Ethereum remains robust. With BlackRock’s ETHA capturing the lion’s share of flows, its performance will likely remain a bellwether for the sector. If sustained, these inflows would continue to position Ethereum ETFs as a central driver of Ethereum’s institutional adoption heading into 2026.

Similar to its Ethereum ETF counterpart, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the market once again, leading with $866.84 million in aggregate inflows. At the time of writing, total net assets across all Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $152.31 billion, representing 6.63% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Meanwhile, cumulative inflows have reached $57.72 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

September 21, 2025 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz Avert your eyes! My Sunday morning look at incompetence, corruption and policy failures: • Mind the Gap 2025? The more investors traded, the less they made: We estimate the average dollar invested in US mutual funds and exchange-traded funds earned 7.0% per year over the 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2024 (“investor return”). That’s about 1.2 percentage points per year less than these funds’ 8.2% aggregate annual total return (“total return”) over that span. This “investor return gap” is explained by the timing and magnitude of investors’ purchases and sales of fund shares during the 10-year period, equivalent to around 15% of the funds’ aggregate total return. (Morningstar). • ‘The whole thing is screwed up’: Farmers in deep-red Pennsylvania struggle to find workers: They’re pushing lawmakers to move faster on a farm labor solution, even as the president cracks down on immigration. (Politico) but see also American Farmers Are Feeling the Pain of Trump’s Policies: US agricultural communities that had expected Trump to have their backs have found themselves flung into a second trade war. If the situation continues, it could put loyalties at risk. (BusinessWeek) • Why private equity needs you more than you need them: President Trump says he wants ordinary Americans to be able to invest in private equity. But in reality, the industry needs your cash. (Washington Post) • Behind closed doors, a majority of CEOs admit they won’t boost U.S. investment as tariffs hurt their businesses. Uncertainty is proving to be a major obstacle to President Donald Trump’s plans to revive the industrial sector as CEOs balk at making U.S. investments, according to a recent survey. (Fortune) • The Spectacular Comeback Tour of a Crypto Convict: Ross Ulbricht, who created the Silk Road dark web marketplace and was serving a life sentence for drug distribution, has embarked on a strange and unexpected comeback after President Trump pardoned him in January. (New York Times) • Data investigation: Childhood vaccination rates are backsliding across the U.S. A monthslong NBC News data investigation finds that much of the U.S. doesn’t have the protection needed to stop the spread of deadly diseases. St. Louis is a window into the problem communities face nationwide. (NBC News) see also Why 1 in 6 U.S. parents are rejecting vaccine recommendations: A wide-ranging Washington Post-KFF poll details who tends to reject vaccine recommendations and their reasoning. (Washington Post) • Police cameras tracked one driver 526 times in four months, lawsuit says: Flock Safety says it has become “the largest public-private safety network” in the country. (NBC News) • Does Anybody Care This Is The Worst Bribery Scandal Since Teapot Dome? The UAE put $2 billion into World Liberty Financial, then got export restrictions lifted on AI chips. Nothing to see here, move along. (New Republic) • ​​Trump Tried to Kill the Infrastructure Law. Now He’s Taking Credit for Its Projects. Signs bearing President Trump’s name have gone up at major construction projects financed by the 2021 law, which he strenuously opposed ahead of its passage. (New York Times) see also Trump Is Shutting Down the War On Cancer: America’s cancer research system, which has helped save millions of lives, is under threat in one of its most productive moments. (New York Times) • The Chess Cheating Epidemic: The Chief Chess Officer of Chess.com describes the crisis he confronted when Norwegian chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen lost a tournament match to a suspected cheater. (Quillette) Be sure to check out our Masters in Business this week with Jaime Magyera, Head of U.S. Wealth & Retirement Business at BlackRock. She has driven the firms adoption of alternatives as a fast growing part of the Blackrock platform for advisors and RIAs.

The stock market may be feeling a little bubbly, but it is nothing like the parabolic, internet-hyped tech trade of the late 1990s. Oracle’s near 40% one-day surge last week on a bullish forecast stirred up memories of that frothy period—and some concern about excess AI optimism. But there is a big difference between now and the stock market party of 1999: Companies now are making real money. Back then, “the price performance was insane," said Dan Greenhaus, strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. “Stocks were splitting multiple times a year because the appreciation was so great." “Everything was going public, whether they had any sales or not. There was a level of enthusiasm across markets and sectors that really doesn’t feel similar to today." Today’s major tech companies are pricey, but nowhere close to “dot-com bubble valuations," Greenhaus said. The bull market could run longer. Famously, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan used the term “irrational exuberance" to describe elevated asset prices in December 1996, years before the market peaked. Tech stocks tied to AI are benefiting from real impacts on their earnings. Market darling Nvidia “keeps going up in general, but it isn’t getting more expensive," Greenhaus said. The stock’s rise is driven by “extreme earnings and sales revisions," not just valuations, he said. Oracle’s big stock move came after the company reported an AI revenue forecast much stronger than the market expected. It now sees its cloud infrastructure revenue reaching $144 billion over the next four years, up from a projected $18 billion this fiscal year. The companies driving the market today “have so much excess cash flow that they’re buying back their stock," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. “They can still spend on capital expenditure and research and development, and they still have plenty of money to buy back their stocks. That was the exact opposite of the tech bubble," Rieder said. Rieder said AI adoption is “an extraordinary expenditure that is changing the economic landscape" with the power to bring about huge gains in productivity. The breadth of the AI trade is also much greater than the internet and Y2K focused trade of the late 1990s and early 2000. Stocks that were considered “old economy" at the time traded with low valuations, while internet-related plays commanded sky high premiums. The market is treating AI innovation differently. Evercore ISI describes its influence on stocks as a “participatory democracy," with the potential to benefit the companies that create it, support it, and use it. AI can create winners across industries, well beyond tech. The firm notes that a quarter of companies are adopting AI just three years after the public launch of ChatGPT. During the last two years of the tech bubble, more stocks were going down daily than were rising, signaling a serious deterioration in the health of the market, according to Evercore ISI. That is opposite what is happening now, with more stocks advancing, taking indexes higher. The broader profit picture is also different. “Intel, Sun Micro, Cisco, Microsoft, the big guys were profitable then. It was the huge satellite of peripheral companies that weren’t profitable," Greenhaus said. Amazon, one of the tech heavyweights in the Magnificent 7, wasn’t profitable during the tech bubble. Its first quarterly profit was in 2021. “The best money wasn’t made on the companies that were building the internet. The best money was made on the companies that became the business because of the internet. Amazon, for instance," Greenhaus said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she is seeing some signs of froth in the market. But she believes the bull market will continue. “When sentiment gets to the frothier end of the spectrum, that sentiment can last for a long time," said Sonders. While the Magnificent 7 stocks have fueled much of the gains in the S&P 500, the tech giants, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, aren’t the biggest gainers in the stock market this year, she notes. Meta is the best performing Mag 7 stock in the S&P 500, but it is the 57th best performing stock in the S&P, while Alphabet was 58th, according to Schwab. Sonders said she currently isn’t recommending specific sectors, or even just high-quality stocks. She sees “opportunity a little bit down the quality spectrum into some of the more value-oriented areas, but you don’t want to sacrifice decent growth opportunities." She looks for factors like positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprises, low price-to-book, low-price-to-sales, and amount of free cash flow. Some strategists have been expecting a correction to tamp down some of the market’s enthusiasm. Sonders said there has been a rolling correction across the market. She notes the S&P 500 was down 19% at its low point this year, while at the average member level, the drawdown was 25% from the year-to-date highs. The S&P quickly recovered and went on to set new highs. Sonders said the biggest gainers of the Nasdaq currently include small, lesser-known stocks. “There are retail traders’ fingerprints all over this market move. They are sort of full steam ahead—and they buy the dip, buy every little dip. And so at some point you could argue, the music ends. But it could last awhile."

Title:  Is AI a bubble? - by Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren
URL: https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble
Time Published: 2025-09-21T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
A month ago, I set out to answer a deceptively simple question: Is AI a bubble? Since 2024, people have been asking me this as I’ve spoken at events around the world. Even as Wall Street bankers largely see this as an investment boom, more people are asking the question in meeting rooms and conference halls in Europe and the US. Some have made up their minds. Gary Marcus called it a “peak bubble.” The Atlantic warns that there is a “possibility that we’re currently experiencing an AI bubble, in which investor excitement has gotten too far ahead of the technology’s near-term productivity benefits. If that bubble bursts, it could put the dot-com crash to shame – and the tech giants and their Silicon Valley backers won’t be the only ones who suffer.” The Economist said that “the potential cost has risen alarmingly high.” The best way to understand a question like this is to create a framework, one that you can update as new evidence emerges. Putting this together has taken dozens of hours of data analysis, modeling and numerous conversations with investors and executives. This essay is that framework: five gauges to weigh genAI against history’s bubbles. I studied and lived through the dot-com bubble. I was an investor and felt its effects firsthand.1 Like many of you, I was also active during the Global Financial Crisis. For this reason, I’ve invested considerable thought and analysis into a robust framework to understand what’s going on. I’ll share it with you today. My thinking is grounded in the study of Carlota Perez, Bill Janeway and other giants in the field, as well as financial analyses of major banks and analysts. But what I haven’t seen anywhere else is a framework that translates those theories into a practical dashboard for AI today: a set of parameters you can read, compare across past bubbles and use to orient your decisions. We will make the underlying data and methodology available to members of Exponential View in the coming weeks. I usually reserve my deep dives for paying members of Exponential View. But this question is too important, and the public debate clouded by posturing, for me to keep it behind a paywall. So today’s piece is free for everyone to read. If you want to access this analysis as a PDF, you can download it here. If you are an investor or executive navigating these questions, I am opening a very limited number of consultation sessions to work directly on them. This is a bespoke opportunity to stress-test your strategy with the same analytical framework I’ve developed. You can apply here. Bubbles are among the oldest stories of capitalism. They’re parables of excess, belief and collapse. But bubbles are not just financial phenomena; they are cultural artifacts. They return again and again as morality tales about greed and folly. Tulip mania, often misremembered as a frenzy of bankrupt weavers and drowning merchants, was less disastrous than legend suggests. It was confined to wealthy merchants and left the Dutch economy largely unscathed. But the myth has endured, and that is the point: bubbles become stories we tell ourselves about the dangers of optimism. Some bubbles are financial: the South Sea frenzy of the 1720s, the roaring stock market of the 1920s, Japan’s real-estate boom in the 1980s and the housing crash of 2008.2 Some are technological. In the 1840s, railways were hailed as the veins of a new industrial body. They were. But a body needs only so many veins, and tracks were soon laid in places commerce could not sustain. Telecoms in the 1990s promised a wired utopia, only for 70 million miles of excess fiber to lie dark underground. The dot-com boom gave us visions of a new economy, much of which did eventually materialize, but not before valuations evaporated in 2000. The funny thing is that there doesn’t seem to be an academic consensus on what an investment bubble is. Nobel laureate in economics Eugene Fama has gone so far as to say they don’t exist. I want to go beyond the notion that we know a bubble when we see a bubble. There are two interrelated systems at work. The first, the most visible, is when stock markets become absurdly overvalued and collapse. The second is whether the quantity of productive capital (going into capital expenditure or venture capital) deployed collapses. The two are related, of course. A collapse in equity prices makes investment flows more expensive. And a secular decline in productive capital investment may be read by equity markets as a harbinger of a slowdown. But to frame this: we see a bubble as being a 50% drawdown from the peak equity value that is sustained for at least five years. In the case of the US housing bubble and the dot-com, that trough was roughly five years long. Full recovery to pre-bubble peaks took 10 years for US housing, and 15 for the dot-com. Alongside, we would expect a substantial decline in the rate of productive capital deployed, once again 50% from peak. For the purposes of this analysis, by “bubble” I’ll address both of those competing dimensions. Ultimately, it means a phase marked by a rapid escalation in prices and investment, where valuations drift materially away from the underlying prospects and realistic earnings power of the assets involved. Bubbles thrive on abundant capital and seductive narratives, and they tend to end in a sharp and sustained reversal that wipes out much of the paper wealth created on the way up. A “boom,” by contrast, can look very similar in its early stages with rising valuations and accelerating investment. But the crucial distinction is that, in a boom, fundamentals eventually catch up. The underlying cash flows, productivity gains, or genuine demand growth rise to meet the optimism. Booms can still overshoot, but they consolidate into durable industries and lasting economic value. Between the two lies a gray zone: periods of exuberance when it is genuinely hard to tell whether capital is building the foundations of a new economy or merely inflating prices that will not be sustained. It’s like being in the eye of a storm: you can feel the wind, rain and pressure, but you don’t yet know whether it will clear the air or flatten the house. This brings us to the present question: is AI another bubble? What unsettles many observers are the numbers. Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, hyperscalers have more than doubled their annual data center capex, betting heavily on the infrastructure needed to train and run ever-larger models. When Sam Altman floated a $7 trillion investment requirement last year, it sounded like hubris. Today, investors aren’t laughing; they’re wondering whether the scale of spending is sustainable. Bubbles are impossible to diagnose in real time. Only in retrospect do we know whether exuberance was justified or delusional. Rather than making a definitive call — which borders on unhelpful speculation — it’s better to benchmark today’s boom against history to spot where bubble-like dynamics may be creeping in. We’re thinking of this as flying a plane. Pilots don’t rely on a single instrument. They monitor a cluster of gauges to understand how the flight is going. We’ll use five of them here: Gauge 1 – Economic strain: Is investment now large enough to bend the economy? Gauge 2 – Industry strain: Are industry revenues commensurate with the deployed capex? Gauge 3 – Revenue growth: Is revenue rising/broadening fast enough to catch up? Gauge 4 – Valuation heat: How hot are valuations? Compared to history, are stocks excessively overpriced? Gauge 5 – Funding quality: What kind of money is funding this? Is it strong balance sheets, or fragile, flighty capital? In the rest of the essay, I look at each gauge to explain why it may be green, amber or red, and at the end I pull them together into a full dashboard view. The investment underway is vast, with Morgan Stanley expecting $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by 2029. But it has not yet reached the runaway extremes of history’s great blowouts. What makes this dimension tricky is dependence. In the US, more than a third of GDP growth can be traced to data center construction. This is not inherently bad, but it may be dangerous if the momentum falters. An economy leaning this heavily on one sector for growth can find the ground falling away faster than expected. The surge of capital expenditure (capex), poured into the physical infrastructure that AI demands, is an act of optimism. This is what capex is. Money spent today in the belief that it will become a funnel of revenue tomorrow. If it’s well-placed today, it will eventually lead to productivity gains and economic expansion. If you want to sell people hula hoops to promote their health and happiness, you need to buy hula hoops first. And somewhere down the line, there needs to be a factory making them. Funding that factory is capex. You deploy the capex to build a useful thing that you can sell. Capex investment is often, but not always, a precursor to a growing business. AI data centers have a similar quality, and something more. They are not just factories for a single product; they are infrastructure. Microsoft, OpenAI and the US government all see it this way. They see compute as a foundational utility of the 21st century, no less critical than highways, railways, power grids or telecom networks were in earlier eras. I made the same argument in my last book, so you can guess where I stand. Excluding the US, sovereign governments have made more than $1 trillion in commitments to AI as infrastructure by 2030. To build such infrastructure inevitably requires historic sums, on a par with the railway and electricity build-outs of the past. McKinsey projects that meeting AI-driven demand by 2030 will require around 156 GW of new electrical capacity — the size of Spain’s and Portugal’s grids combined. The firm estimates this will cost $5-7.9 trillion in capital spending. For context, this is about twenty times the cost of the Apollo missions. This would place AI data centers among the largest infrastructure build-outs in modern history. But useful though infrastructure is, especially when private capital gets involved, things can get divorced from reality. The financing structure matters as much as the technology itself. The railways in the US were largely privately funded and suffered from multiple investment bubbles. Electricity and road systems, by contrast, benefited from greater public investment and coordination, and were less prone to speculative excess. A boom becomes dangerous when the resources it demands start to bend the whole economy around it. Wages get sucked into one sector, supply chains reorient to serve it and capital markets grow dependent on it. The snapback is vicious when expectations break. One way to gauge the economic strain is to look at investment as a share of GDP, the portion of national output funneled into a single technological frontier. It is a crude but telling ratio. It shows how heavily the economy leans on one technological bet. In the case of AI infrastructure, most of that spending takes the form of capital expenditures: the servers, cooling systems, networking gear, shells of concrete and steel and the power infrastructure required to keep them running. By that measure, the railway bubbles were the heaviest. In the United States, railway spending peaked at around 4% of GDP in 1872, just before the first great crash. The telecom boom of the late 1990s, by contrast, topped out near 1% of GDP, a level that looks familiar today. The AI build-out sits in this middle zone. Around $370 billion is expected to flow into data centers globally in 2025, with perhaps 70% earmarked for the US,3 or roughly 0.9% of American GDP. Goldman Sachs projects spending will climb by another 17% in 2026. My own forecasts are in line with this view: annual capex of $800 billion by 2030, perhaps 60% in the US, which would bring the American share to 1.6% of 2025 GDP. The economic-strain gauge has three segments: green up to 1%, amber up to 2% and red above 2%. So today, genAI sits in the green zone – just. Of course, given stated commitments, it looks like it’ll head into amber soon. But there is a twist here that history’s bubbles did not face: rapid depreciation. Once laid, a railway track could last decades. The US was still running freight over 19th-century tracks well into the 20th. Telecom fiber rolled out in the 1990s still carries traffic 35 years later. GPUs, by contrast, age in dog years. Their useful life for frontier applications such as model training is perhaps three years, after which they are relegated to lower-intensity tasks. Roughly a third of hyperscaler capex is going into such short-lived assets. They remain, in theory, monetizable in years five and six. The rest goes into shells, power and cooling that last two or three decades. Adjusting for asset life makes the AI build-out look even more demanding: unlike railroads or fiber, the system must earn its keep in a handful of years, not generations. Whether this dynamic makes financial conditions worse or better is an open question. The pessimistic view is that a box of ripe bananas is worth less than the same value of Brazil nuts, because it must be consumed quickly. But the optimistic case is intriguing: shorter depreciation cycles may impose financial discipline on incoming investors. During the railway mania, decades-long asset lives masked the weakness of many business models; companies could stagger on for years before insolvency. In AI, the flaws may surface quickly, forcing either rapid adaptation or rapid failure. The strain is noticeable but not yet unbearable. Venture funding at the AI application layer, while noisy, remains modest compared with the telecom mania of the 1990s.4 That suggests there may still be running room before the cycle overheats. The trillions pouring into servers, cooling systems and power lines may be essential, but history suggests they are not where the enduring profits accumulate. In railways, many track companies went bust, but the logistics firms and commodity barons riding their lines prospered. In telecoms, it was not the builders of fiber who captured the upside but the platforms and service providers that used the bandwidth. The same logic may apply to AI: hyperscalers shoulder the capex burden, but the durable value may accrue to those who control the models, the data and the ecosystems built on top. This brings us to the second gauge on the dashboard: industry strain. Every boom needs to prove that the money poured into new equipment is starting to earn its keep. In any growth stage, it is unlikely that revenues will cover investment, but they should be non-zero. This gauge looks at the ratio of capex to revenues. We estimate that genAI revenues look on track to exceed $60 billion this year, from roughly nil five years ago.5 This number could well undercount the value being generated by genAI. Meta, for example, has suggested that the technology has increased conversions on its platforms by about 3–5%. Indirect effects like this may help explain why some analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, peg 2025 revenues far higher than our estimate, at $153 billion. The big hyperscalers, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, are without doubt moving into a phase of higher capex intensity. In 2021, before ChatGPT, hyperscalers invested about 44% of their operating cash flow in capex. By 2024, that had risen to 68%. In 2025, it will be higher still. But, as Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research points out, these firms can absorb this shift by replatforming, with structurally higher capital intensity driving growth and efficiency gains. This dynamic has been in place for a decade already: between 2015 and 2018, Microsoft Azure’s capex represented between 70% and 90% of revenues. It was an investment in the future. This makes for an interesting comparison to earlier boom cycles. The railroads are particularly pertinent. The railroads’ direct revenue contribution was tiny compared to the value the railroads created in the US economy. Railway bubbles were always tethered to the reality of cash flow. The bonds issued to finance new track and rolling stock had to be serviced out of passenger fares and freight revenues. Whenever capex outpaced earnings, the strain showed. The manias of 1873, 1883 and 1887 all followed the same pattern: a sharp decline in the ratio of annual revenues to capital spending, and in some cases, outright revenue contraction. At the height of the US railroad expansion in 1872, capex was around two times revenues. In the late-1990s telecom bubble, capex amounted to just under four times revenues. By contrast, today’s genAI boom runs on roughly $60 billion in revenues against about $370 billion in global data center capex – a capex-to-revenue ratio of six times, the most stretched of the three.6 On the industry-strain gauge, railways sat healthily in the green. GenAI is in amber, nearing red. It’s not quite a warning sign, not least because genAI has people clamoring for access to AI data centers. One report suggests that enterprise customers are committing to capacity before data centers are even built. What is driving that is usage, and with that comes astonishing revenue growth. The problem in the railroad and telecom booms was not sector strain per se, but that revenues ran out of momentum. Investment expects a return. After the railway bubble burst in 1873, revenue declined by 3% year over year. Telecoms did slightly better, declining 0.5%. Before the crashes, revenue growth was hardly explosive. Railways in 1873 expanded 22% – enough to double in three years. Telecom in the late 1990s managed only 16%, a doubling time of just over four years. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating. By our estimates, genAI revenues will grow about twofold this year.7 And this is likely a conservative forecast. Citi estimates that model makers’ revenue will grow 483% in 2025. OpenAI forecasts annualized growth of about 73% to 2030, while analysts like Morgan Stanley estimate this market could be as large as $1 trillion by 2028, equivalent to compound growth of ~122% a year over the period. Our revenue growth gauge is an exponential one. It measures revenue doubling time in years; that is, at current growth rates, how long does it take for sector revenue to double? Here, genAI sits squarely in the green, doubling every year. Much of this spending flows down to the hyperscalers and neoclouds that run the infrastructure. Hyperscalers make tons of money, so they can afford to invest, trimming a few points off earnings if they think it positions them well for the future. Oracle projects that its cloud business could generate around $380 billion in cumulative revenues by 2030. In my conversations with large companies, I get the strong sense that they can’t get enough of this technology right now. And this likely supports the strong growth rates. IBM’s CEO survey shows that genAI is already expanding IT budgets, with 62% of respondents indicating they will increase their AI investments in 2025. Demand is so high that new data centers are at full utilization as soon as they come online, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noting that “as fast as we put the capacity in, it’s being consumed” and Sam Altman remarking that a lack of compute was affecting model upgrades. Jensen Huang expected this would happen early in 2024, predicting that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell chips would outstrip supply well into next year. Some 9% of US firms have one useful genAI use case. Back-of-the-napkin math suggests that 9% will become 75% within five years, and the number of use cases will rise from one to hundreds.8 That on its own points to a thousandfold increase in something. I say *something* because the current billing-by-token model may change.9 Even if it doesn’t, we’ll see dramatic price declines on per-token pricing, likely by orders of magnitude. The underlying point is that we are still at the foothills of enterprise use. For now, firms can barely secure enough tokens to meet their needs. The consumer side tells a parallel story. US consumers already spend about $1.4 trillion a year online. This could plausibly double to $3 trillion by 2030 if it grows at 15–17% a year (it has grown at more than 14% a year since 2013). Against this backdrop, a genAI app sector rising from today’s $10 billion to $500 billion within five years looks less far-fetched. Exponential growth rates of 300-500% are already visible in mid-sized startups and the large model providers (see last week’s essay on OpenAI’s valuation), suggesting that even a small reallocation of consumer digital spending could drive revenues into the hundreds of billions. Taken together, these signals point to an industry still in strong ascent, unlike the relatively meager revenue growth that preceded the railroad and telecom busts. If genAI revenues were to grow at even half the pace of last year, then, on my conservative forecast, they would reach $100 billion by 2026, covering about 25% of that year’s capex. If economic and industry strain show the weight of the boom and revenue growth its trajectory, valuation heat is the mood of the market. This is often where bubbles reveal themselves most clearly: how exuberantly investors are pricing the sector, regardless of fundamentals. As Carlota Perez has argued for decades, financial markets tend to overshoot in the early “installation phase” of each technological revolution, pouring in capital far beyond what near-term revenues justify. The frenzy looks irrational in the moment, but it is the mechanism by which society lays down the new infrastructure. The challenge is whether the frenzy can evolve into the “deployment phase,” when the infrastructure becomes universal and delivers real productivity gains. The dot-com bubble is the archetype. Companies with no profits at all floated at triple-digit multiples, some raising more on IPO day than they would ever earn in revenues. Boo.com raised $135 million from investors, including LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, and pitched itself as the “Amazon of fashion.” The site launched in 18 countries with localized language and shipping, with a virtual avatar, “Miss Boo,” who gave shopping tips on 3D models. It spent $25 million on advertising before launch, ballooned staff from 40 to 400, and opened plush offices across New York and Europe. The JavaScript- and Flash-heavy website was nearly unusable on dial-up connections, incompatible with Mac computers and buggy. One in four attempted purchases failed. Despite the extravagance – lavish parties, Concorde flights and celebrity stylists for Miss Boo – polls showed that just 13% of internet users knew the brand existed. Within 18 months, the money was gone. Boo.com collapsed in May 2000.10 What’s going on in genAI does not compare to this. The key measure here is the price/earnings ratio (P/E), a shorthand for how many years of current profits an investor is effectively paying for. If a company has $1 in annual earnings and trades at a P/E of 20, buyers are paying $20 for each dollar of current profit, assuming growth will make that worthwhile. A high P/E means companies are betting on rapid future growth, but too high, for too long, investors might be buying into a fantasy. This was the case in the dot-com era. At the peak, the Nasdaq traded at a P/E of about 72. One detailed study estimated that internet stocks alone carried an implied P/E of 605. In other words, investors were willing to pay for more than six centuries of current earnings. The issue wasn’t that demand disappeared – Amazon’s revenues grew from $2.76 billion in 2000 to $3.12 billion in 2001 – but that no company could grow fast enough to justify those sky-high expectations. The fundamentals improved, but expectations collapsed. Today, the picture is much calmer. The Nasdaq P/E is about 32, half that of the dot-com era. The broader tech market is higher than the long-run average, but nowhere near dot-com territory. Compared to the railroad bubbles, which had an estimated P/E of around 20, it is high. But the railroads ended badly, not because valuations were extreme in themselves, but because revenue growth faltered. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating rapidly. Another indicator of valuation excess that many investors pay attention to is the so-called “Buffett Indicator”, which measures how far ahead of GDP equity market valuations have risen. There is no doubt that this indicator is peaky, well above a two-standard-deviation anomaly that often presages market corrections. We are more sanguine, for the moment. History rhymes; it doesn’t repeat. The Buffett indicator relies on GDP, and GDP is famously bad at capturing technological productivity gains. In addition, a large portion of big tech revenues comes from outside the US, decoupling their earnings from domestic GDP. Finally, AI-based productivity may affect margins – keeping output (and GDP constant), while increasing corporate profits. So while we keep an eye on the Buffett indicator (and its distant cousin, the Shiller CAPE ratio), we feel the different dynamics of an accelerating digital economy are not well captured by them. So how hot is this gauge? My verdict is green. Prices haven’t yet broken free of gravity in the way dot-com valuations did. Funding quality is not a standard metric but a composite judgment. It asks who the money is coming from, how it is structured and whether the capital is willing to wait years for returns or rather chase quarterly pops. Low-quality capital, in short, is short-termist, undisciplined and debt-laden; it rushes and flees quickly. High-quality capital is more patient, better underwritten, and able to withstand volatility. Every bubble has its signature weakness, invariably rooted in how it was financed. Railways were fueled by speculative retail investors with little capital behind them. By the early 1870s, funded debt averaged 46% of total assets among American railroads; when overbuilding met a credit squeeze, financing evaporated. The Panic of 1873 sent rail lines into receivership. Dot-com firms, a century later, were a little sturdier. Venture capital was a boutique business in 1995, with only $5.3 billion deployed. By 2001, more than $237 billion had been poured into startups, often by new and inexperienced managers. The frenzy spilled into public markets: IPO volume between 1999 and 2000 ran six times above historical averages. Companies went public with little revenue. Two of my friends took theGlobe.com public in 1998 and enjoyed a 606% share-price pop the day they went public. Telecoms in the late 1990s leaned on mountains of cheap debt. US and European carriers doubled and quadrupled their leverage in just a few years. Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom together added $78 billion in net debt between 1998 and 2001. When revenues failed to keep pace, defaults rippled through the sector. In each case, the capital that fueled the boom proved ephemeral. But the degree of fragility differed. Railways and telecoms were most exposed to credit crunches, with debt ratios ballooning. Dot-coms were hostage to market mood, with equity values evaporating. On this front, today’s AI boom looks sturdier. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are minting extraordinary cash flows, easily enough to bankroll their own build-out. For now. But investment needs are racing ahead. Morgan Stanley reckons total global data center capex will hit $2.9 trillion between 2025 and 2028. Hyperscalers can cover perhaps half of that from internal cash. The rest must come from private credit, securitized finance and new operators. Governments have also pledged $1.6 trillion in sovereign AI investments, and Gulf capital is seeking new opportunities. Here is where the risks creep in. Morgan Stanley itself points to a $1.5 trillion gap that will need to be plugged by debt markets and asset-backed securities. The sums are enormous: $800 billion from private credit, $150 billion in data center ABS,11 and hundreds of billions more in OEM loans and vendor financing.12 That $150 billion alone would triple the size of the data-center securitized markets almost overnight. And not every borrower looks like Microsoft. Consider CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed upstart now going public with $8 billion of debt. It has already slipped into technical default on loans, missing covenants without being insolvent, and its revenues depend on just two customers. Its economics rest on renting GPUs that depreciate by 20–30% per year, more like a WeWork lease than a hyperscaler’s durable balance sheet. In other words, the foundation is stronger than in past bubbles, but the superstructure is starting to resemble the old pattern. Esoteric debt structures, concentrated counterparties and hardware that may not hold value are reappearing. If genAI revenues grow tenfold, creditors will be fine. If not, they may discover that a warehouse full of obsolete GPUs is a difficult thing to secure. For now, my gauge is greenish. We’re not yet in bubble territory, but if financing keeps creeping this way over the next year without revenue growth as robust as 2025’s, it might tick over to amber. On the basis of these gauges, genAI remains in a demand-led, capital-intensive boom rather than a bubble. But booms can sour quickly, and there are several pressure points worth watching: If investment climbs toward 2% of GDP, it could suggest the economy is overweighting AI relative to its productivity returns; equally, if one or more hyperscalers were to cut capex by more than a fifth over the next three to five years, that would mark a sharp turn in sentiment that could trigger a rapid decline among other players. A sustained fall in current enterprise and consumer spending levels would be another warning, especially if foreshadowed by a shrinking Nvidia order backlog. At the same time, the economics need to improve: revenues per dollar of capital should move toward the 0.5–1.0 range. Should the gap fail to close, it would imply that scale is not delivering the expected efficiencies. If valuations start approaching a P/E ratio of 50-60, it would look frothy, since a genuine growth phase should see earnings catching up with prices, not lagging further behind. If internal cash covers less than 25% of capex, data center investment stability comes under pressure. Right now, stability comes from hyperscalers’ strong cash flows. If they stop covering the majority of capex, then more debt and securitization will creep in. Not great given a GPU’s depreciation cycle. If internal funding slips below a quarter of new capex and reliance shifts toward debt and securitization, the sector’s dependence on short-lived GPUs and its exposure to higher interest rates could quickly become destabilizing. My current heuristic is that if two of the five gauges head into red, you’re in bubble territory. Time to sell up, buy the VIX and take some deep breaths. In the year prior to the Panic of 1873, the railroad’s economic strain turned red, accompanied by a decline in funding quality. Anemic revenue growth didn’t help. With the telecoms crash of 2001, revenue growth and funding quality blared red. In the dot-com era, it was industry investment strain and valuations. GenAI isn’t there yet. Racing fast, the engine is whining, but not overheating. How long would it take for two gauges to get into the red? I’ve toyed around with combinations, and most scary scenarios take a couple of years to play out. (And not all scenarios are scary.) That said, so many macro factors, from a recession in the US, to rising inflation, a challenging interest-rate environment, and domestic or international politics, could dampen spirits. While we might not be solidly in bubbleland, it would be hubristic to assume the AI investment cycle is immune to those exuberant dynamics. Onward. For now. Share I even wrote a blurb on the 1999 book The Internet Bubble. Edward Chancellor’s book on bubbles is a useful guide. Last year, SemiAnalysis forecast that around 70% of data center capacity build-out will happen in the US over the medium term. Adjusted for inflation, VC investment in the internet in 2000 was $85.9 billion; Dealroom.co reports $47 billion for the AI application layer last year – a difference of $38.9 billion. Revenues are compiled from primary corporate disclosures (SEC filings, earnings transcripts, investor presentations, press releases) and supplemented by analyst and consultancy estimates (McKinsey, Gartner, IDC, etc.) where company reporting is incomplete. We prioritize disclosed figures, adjust for potential double-counting in revenue-sharing agreements (e.g., OpenAI–Microsoft), and categorize revenue streams (subscription, API, infrastructure, licensing) to maintain comparability. Private-company revenues (e.g., Anthropic, Midjourney) rely on reported run-rates or credible press/VC sources, flagged as estimates. See previous footnote for genAI revenue model. Railroads calculated from FRED data and telecoms from OECD data on US leased line revenues. Our model shows 130% growth among AI companies year over year. Starting from about six million US firms, assume 9% (about 540,000) now have one useful genAI use case; project adoption to 75% (about 4.5 million) within five years, and average use cases per adopting firm to rise from about 1 to about 100 – yielding roughly 450 million use cases, an increase of about 830 times; illustrative, not a forecast. Most genAI services today are billed “by the token.” A token is a unit of text, usually about four characters or ¾ of a word. Customers are charged for tokens processed in prompts and responses (for example, a 1,000-word output might equal ~1,300 tokens). This model directly links cost to usage, but it may evolve as enterprises negotiate flat-rate contracts, consumption bundles, or outcome-based pricing. I spent an afternoon walking through Boo’s deserted offices after the collapse to see if any physical assets retained value. Asset-backed securities are bonds sold to investors, backed by cash flows from a pool of underlying assets. In this case, the assets are data center leases or infrastructure contracts, allowing operators to raise capital by securitizing predictable rental or service revenues. OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Dell, Cisco or Nvidia often extend credit to customers or partner with financing arms to help them buy hardware. Vendor financing is the broader term for suppliers lending to buyers, typically repaid out of the revenues generated from using the purchased equipment. First of all, thanks for the reference to my work in your thoughtful, balanced and all but comprehensive analysis. There is one further aspect of these transformational technologies that are deployed as network-based services. This is the pricing dynamics when (a) the ability to deliver the first unit of service requires very large capital investment and (2) the marginal cost of delivering incremental units of services is very low. Then, marginal cost will be below average cost and – under competitive conditions – price will tend to be driven towards marginal cost. The result, of course, is negative cash flow for all competitors which, in turn, incentivizes some mix of regulatory intervention to protect the competitors from each other (ICC, PUCs) and evolution towards oligopoly/monopoly. I gather that inklings of these dynamics can be seen in the decline of cost/price per token. I am very interested in your take on this issue when it comes to roll out of the foundational models at increasing scale. -- Bill Janeway You certainly are right to mobilize demand elasticity as the counter MC<AC. But token cost is not the full cost of AI deployment. Given the probabilistic nature of the LLM token-prediction process, applications will vary by the intensity of the need for human supervision, debugging, etc. I don’t know how representative this RCT was, but it did strike me as suggesting a somewhat more complicated scenario: https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/ .

THE COMMUNICATOR Gina London with Daniel Zaragoza Almost every day, I find myself at my local shopping centre in Blackrock Village, just outside Dublin. Sometimes it’s for a grocery run and a chat with cashier Brian. Other times it’s a quick trip to the hardware store and a lively conversation with shopkeeper Josh. I appreciate all the friendly people I interact with there – but there’s one interaction that always gives me a lift even before I step inside. It happens in the basement car park. As I pull in, I am greeted by a wave and the smiling face of Daniel Zaragoza, who manages the car valet service. He doesn’t just welcome me; he greets every regular customer like an old friend. Daniel is a fixture. His warmth is matched by the upbeat music he always plays which fills the air with surround sound and the little Christmas tree that brightens his car wash station with year-round twinkling lights. The whole scene is festive and somehow reassuring. So I wanted to learn more about the man behind the ever-present smile. We met over an early morning coffee at the nearby Starbuck’s. Daniel shared how his life began in the heart of Mexico city. The youngest of six, he lost his father when he was just a year old and his mother by the time he was 12. His eldest sister, only 21 at the time, stepped in to help raise him and his siblings. Life wasn’t easy, but Daniel worked in barbershops and restaurants while still attending school, eventually graduating from high school. By the time he was 19, he had a full-time job at KFC as a cashier. One manager saw his potential and invited him to join the franchise’s main office. “Of course, I said yes,” Daniel remembered. For four years, he crisscrossed Mexico city, delivering checks and contracts, learning responsibility and resilience on the job. Daniel became a father at 21. With his girlfriend and young son, he decided to look abroad for opportunity and adventure. A man passed by wearing a T-shirt that read: ‘Kiss me, I’m Irish.’ That was my sign “We went as tourists,” he says of their first trip to Canada. They eventually secured residency in Toronto, where he worked nights in hotel maintenance and studied English in the mornings. Nine years brought a daughter and job promotions – culminating in responsibility for a team of eight and a second job managing maintenance for an office complex. But when the clock ran out on his Canadian residency, he returned to Mexico, this time to Cancun. Hotels, nightclubs, and restaurant jobs kept him afloat, but he longed for something more. Over coffee one day, he told a friend he wanted to move to Europe. “My friend asked me which country I would like to go to – and at that very moment, a man passed by wearing a T-shirt that read: ‘Kiss me, I’m Irish.’ That was my sign,” he says with a laugh. Within a month, Daniel and his eldest sister were on a plane to Dublin. She was studying, and he was ready for a new start. In 2016, he found work at the Blackrock Shopping Centre car park. “I had never even been to Blackrock before,” he recalled. He started at the car wash on a trial basis. Within two days, his managers offered him the role permanently. Today, nine years later, he’s the manager, overseeing a team of 11 at No H2O Detailers. What sets Daniel apart is not just the quality of his work but his approach to people. His years in hospitality have taught him that the customer experience is what matters most. “I try to make each car wash special,” he shared. “It’s not just about a clean car. It’s about how you receive people, how you smile at them, how you listen.” His attention to detail is unwavering. He personally checks each vehicle to ensure it meets his standards. He also adds personal touches – sometimes it’s a small chocolate, sometimes he’ll give a hug – but whatever it is, it’s consistently kind. And customers notice. He told me that he has some clients who travel for business from France and England and stop in monthly, just to see him. Others, like me, ask for his playlist, which consists of an eclectic mix including Canadian band Men I Trust, the group Cannons, and plenty of Seventies and Eighties rock. I see a life story of resilience, adaptability, and purpose Life has had its share of challenges. His relationship with his children’s mother ended when they were young, and she returned to Mexico with them. But Daniel later reconnected and remains close. His son, now 25, lives in Kildare and manages a car wash of his own. His daughter lives in Canada. Daniel recently secured Irish residency and looks forward to attending his citizenship ceremony next year. He and his son are also quietly working on an entrepreneurial project together – details still under wraps. When I ask what motivates him, Daniel’s answer is simple: “My goal is to make one person happy every day. When people smile back, I feel rewarded. That’s the payback.” Each time I pull into the Blackrock Centre’s car park, I see more than a friendly smile. I see a life story of resilience, adaptability, and purpose. Daniel Zaragoza’s journey from Mexico City to Dublin is a reminder that no matter where we start, or what obstacles we face, we can choose to create joy and community wherever we stand – even in an underground car park.

Title: Stocks Over Spot: The Case For Buying Bitcoin Treasury Companies Instead Of BTC
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/the-case-for-buying-bitcoin-treasury/
Time Published: 2025-09-21T00:00:34Z

Bitcoin is among the world’s most important assets, but owning it directly is not the only way to get exposure. A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk, allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset. Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: American labor has a new challenge: Trump’s $100K fee on H-1B visas | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/20/business/h-1b-fee-trump-immigration-workers
Time Published: 2025-09-20T22:06:12Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump’s latest effort to overhaul America’s legal immigration system — raising the annual fee on H-1B visa applicants from $215 to $100,000 — could deal a major blow to some US industries that rely on skilled foreign workers. During a signing at the Oval Office Friday, Trump argued that America needs “great workers” and that the newly imposed fee “pretty much ensures that that’s what’s going to happen.” Administration officials also claimed the hefty fee would incentivize companies to hire American workers. “The company needs to decide … is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home and go hire an American?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the signing. “That’s the point of immigration: Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people.” Of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted annually, another 20,000 are reserved for people with advanced degrees from American higher education institutions. But Trump’s allies have been divided on how to tackle the visa program. Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, whom Trump chose to lead the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, have defended companies that use the work visa and depend on foreign workers to operate. Steve Bannon, a top strategist in Trump’s first term, blasted H-1B visas on his “War Room” podcast in December 2024 as a “scam” by Silicon Valley titans, who are about “taking American jobs and bringing over what essentially become indentured servants at lower wages.” Here’s what the new policy means for businesses and workers. The $100,000 visa fee, which takes effect Sunday at 12:01 a.m. ET, will apply only to new H-1B applications, according to the White House. The rule expires a year later, on September 21, 2026, unless it’s extended. “This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Saturday, adding that it does not apply to renewals or current visa holders. Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, advised visa holders to reconsider international travel plans and to consider returns to the United States by Saturday night, if necessary, according to emails viewed by CNN. But Leavitt clarified Saturday afternoon that any current H-1B holders who are outside the United States will not be charged $100,000 to reenter. Most H-1B petitions approved during fiscal 2024 — which spanned from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024 — were for computer-related roles (64%), according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report. The next largest occupation was in the field of architecture, engineering and surveying (10%). The third-most-approved petitions were for education-related jobs (6%), according to USCIS. The “largest detailed industry sector” for approved H-1B visas was related to custom computer programming (25%). Professional, scientific and technical services was the No. 1 industry among employers (48%), while manufacturing (11%) was the second-most popular. According to the USCIS data hub, Amazon is the largest H-1B sponsor. The online retailing giant was approved for more than 9,000 H-1B visas during fiscal 2024. Tech giants also rely on the H-1B program, with Google sponsoring 5,364 approved H-1B visas in fiscal 2024, followed by Meta (4,844), Microsoft (4,725) and Apple (3,873). Small businesses and startups are more likely to balk at that $100,000 fee than companies like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The four companies have a combined capitalization of about $11.1 trillion. The fee could also mean foreign-born workers would be denied entry-level positions, as the $100,000 cost would be too much of a burden to pay for a lower-waged worker. Recent college graduates, who are experiencing the worst market for new grads since the Covid-19 pandemic, could stand to gain from job openings if the openings remain in America. That’s particularly good news for computer science and tech-related graduates, who are entering the market amid rounds of layoffs and plummeting opportunities. During his 2016 campaign, Trump accused US companies of using H-1B visas “for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.” But the USCIS reported that, of approved H-1B petitions, the median annual compensation was $120,000. Companies will likely continue to offer higher-paying salaries to the best talent pool of foreign workers. But restrictions could make companies shift hiring initiatives abroad to countries like India, China and Canada, according to the American Immigration Council. Placing limits on H-1B holders doesn’t guarantee Americans will be hired in the impacted sectors. When immigration slowed during the pandemic and following the first Trump administration’s temporary ban on some immigrant visas, it led to record-high job openings. Economists warned at the time that the worker shortage couldn’t be solved without ramping up immigration. “Businesses are having to turn down work because they simply can’t find the workers to do it,” Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, told CNN in 2021. The new fee on visas is likely to be challenged in US courts. “To be clear, the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X. “The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.” CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo, Adam Cancryn, Matt Egan and Yong Xiong contributed to this report.

Title: BlockDAG Leads the Pack: The Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Holders Can’t Ignore

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto market is entering one of its most exciting phases yet, and presales are at the heart of this momentum. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, the real upside often comes from presales that combine utility, community growth, and visionary roadmaps. Among the flood of projects vying for attention, a few stand out for their strong numbers and ambitious goals. BlockDAG, in particular, is rewriting the rules of what a presale can achieve, while others, such as BlockchainFX, JetBolt, and Little Pepe, are building strong momentum. Below, we break down why these coins are generating hype and why BlockDAG is emerging as the clear frontrunner. BlockDAG is proving to be one of the most explosive presales the crypto market has seen in years. With nearly $410 million already raised and more than 26.3 billion BlockDAG coins sold, this project is racing toward its ambitious $600 million goal at record speed. Right now, the coin sits at just $0.0013 in Batch 30, but this golden entry point won’t be around for long as it ends in the next 24 hours. Once it hits its confirmed listing price of $0.05, current holders are guaranteed a 3,746% ROI from day one of trading. But the hype isn’t just numbers on paper. BlockDAG already has 312,000+ holders, has started shipping over 19,900 ASIC miners worldwide, and is powering a massive base of 3 million X1 mobile miners actively running every day. Add in the soon-to-launch Awakening Testnet, which will showcase its technology in real time, and it’s clear this project has execution, not just promises. BlockchainFX has already raised $7.24 million from more than 9,000 participants, making it one of the most promising best crypto presale contenders in the fintech app sector. At a token price of $0.023, early holders are securing a steep discount before its official $0.05 launch price. What sets BFX apart is its “super app” positioning: it connects crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities in a single trading ecosystem. With a beta app already live and presale bonuses, including a 30% token boost for early holders, BlockchainFX is gaining strong momentum. JetBolt is another project generating hype as a fresh best crypto presale option. Built on the SKALE network, it offers zero gas fees, AI-powered utilities, staking rewards, and scalable smart contracts. However, details around tokenomics and pricing remain scarce. While the buzz is strong, JetBolt is still in a very early stage, meaning the upside could be significant if execution follows through, but so could the risks. Little Pepe has taken the meme coin space by storm, raising over $25 million in presale funds. Now priced at $0.0021 in Stage 12, the project has already sold out over 15 billion tokens across earlier rounds. Unlike many meme tokens, LILPEPE runs on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2, featuring near-instant transactions, zero trading tax, and anti-sniper bot protection. With additional incentives like mega giveaways and staking rewards, analysts project this presale could deliver 25× returns post-listing, making it another hot contender for the best crypto presale list. The search for the best crypto presale of 2025 is heating up, and holders have no shortage of options. BlockchainFX is building a multi-asset super app, JetBolt promises next-gen scalability, and Little Pepe combines meme power with serious Layer-2 utility. Each has potential, but none match the scale, adoption, and guaranteed ROI of BlockDAG. With nearly $410 million raised, a $0.0013 entry price, and a locked-in 3,746% ROI at launch, BlockDAG is emerging as the best crypto presale opportunity. BlockDAG’s real-world adoption: 312,000+ holders, 19,900 ASIC miners being shipped, and 3 million X1 app users, shows momentum that most projects never achieve. In 2025, the winners will be the buyers who recognized early that BlockDAG was not just another presale, but a game-changing crypto revolution.

Title: The WSJ Got Quarterly Reporting Wrong: A Corporate Executive's Response

Join thousands of innovation leaders getting weekly insights Why James Mackintosh's defense of quarterly reporting ignores what actually happens in corporate boardrooms. James Mackintosh's recent Wall Street Journal piece defending quarterly earnings reporting reads like a textbook example of why academic analysis often misses the mark when it comes to understanding corporate behavior. As someone who lived this reality for years as Chief Technology Officer at Hewlett-Packard—the world's largest technology company at the time by revenue with massive R&D investments—I can tell you the quarterly reporting system creates perverse incentives that systematically undermine long-term innovation. Mackintosh's central argument rests on flawed premises and cherry-picked data that ignore the lived experience of corporate executives who actually make investment decisions under quarterly pressure. His dismissal misses a critical opportunity to address one of America's most significant competitive disadvantages. Let me share what quarterly reporting actually looks like from the inside. During my tenure as CTO at HP, I experienced how quarterly pressure created systematic patterns across the industry where R&D would be paused, or delayed during quarter-end periods. This became a predictable cycle that repeated quarter after quarter. This behavior wasn’t unique to HP. It's the inevitable result of a system that rewards short-term financial engineering over patient capital investment. When your stock price can swing dramatically based on missing earnings by a few cents per share, the rational response is to optimize for quarterly performance, even at the expense of long-term competitiveness. The academic research Mackintosh cites, including MIT's Robert Pozen's study of UK reporting changes, fundamentally misunderstands how corporate behavior evolves. These researchers have never sat in a boardroom where directors debate whether to continue funding a multi-year innovation project that won't generate revenue for 36 months while facing pressure to meet next quarter's numbers. They've never experienced the intense scrutiny from analysts who penalize any hint of reduced short-term profitability. Through my relationship with Alex Mandl—my former boss at Teligent who led the board negotiations to take Dell private—I witnessed the most compelling modern example. Michael Dell and Silver Lake paid $24.9 billion for one thing—freedom from the quarterly earnings pressure that was killing Dell Technologies long-term potential. Dell explicitly stated the goal was "no more pulling R&D and growth investments to make in-quarter numbers." R&D spending increased from $1.1 billion to $4.4 billion, transforming Dell from declining PC manufacturer to enterprise solutions leader. The result: an estimated $70 billion return by 2023. This wasn't theoretical—it was a $25 billion bet that quarterly reporting pressure was destroying long-term value. And they were proven spectacularly right. Mackintosh's reliance on the UK's 2014 experience with optional quarterly reporting reveals a critical flaw in his reasoning. He argues that because UK companies didn't dramatically change their investment behavior after switching to semi-annual reporting, quarterly reporting must not be problematic. This ignores a fundamental truth: we've trained an entire generation of CEOs, CFOs, and board members to think in 90-day cycles. You don't undo decades of conditioning overnight. When business schools teach earnings management, when compensation systems reward quarterly performance, and when analysts' careers depend on predicting short-term results, making reporting optional doesn't suddenly transform corporate culture. The UK comparison is meaningless without addressing the broader ecosystem that reinforces short-term thinking. Mackintosh points to Big Tech's massive AI investments as proof that quarterly reporting doesn't hinder long-term thinking. This argument reveals a profound misunderstanding of competitive dynamics. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta can hide enormous R&D expenditures within their massive profit margins. When you're generating 20-30% operating margins on hundreds of billions in revenue, you can afford to invest $50 billion in speculative technologies while still meeting quarterly expectations. But what about companies in lower-margin industries? What about manufacturing firms, healthcare companies, or emerging technology businesses that can't disguise innovation investments as easily? The current system creates a two-tier economy where only the most profitable companies can afford to think long-term, while everyone else gets trapped in quarterly optimization cycles. America's competitive advantage has always been rooted in our ability to make patient, long-term investments in breakthrough technologies. The semiconductor industry, the internet, biotechnology, and countless other innovations emerged from companies willing to invest for decades before seeing returns. Today's quarterly reporting regime systematically discourages this kind of "patient innovation." I've written extensively about the concept of the "50-year overnight success"—the reality that truly transformative innovations require sustained investment over multiple decades. Companies need the freedom to pursue breakthrough technologies without explaining every quarter why they're spending money on projects that won't generate revenue for years. Do I think switching from quarterly to semi-annual reporting solves the problem? No. Six months isn't meaningfully different from three months when it comes to long-term thinking. But we can make meaningful reforms that would help: First, eliminate forward-looking earnings guidance. This practice forces companies to make public commitments about future performance, creating enormous pressure to meet those predictions regardless of changing circumstances. Second, create accounting treatments that allow companies to separate long-term innovation investments from operational expenses, giving investors clearer visibility into both current performance and future potential. Third, develop new metrics and incentives that reward patient capital deployment and long-term value creation, not just quarterly financial performance. This isn't an abstract policy debate—it's about America's economic future. While we optimize for quarterly performance, competitors in China and other nations are making massive, sustained investments in critical technologies. Their state-directed approach has significant flaws, as Mackintosh correctly notes, but at least they're thinking in decade-long time horizons. We need American companies to have the same freedom to pursue patient innovation without facing quarterly punishment from investors and analysts who fundamentally misunderstand the innovation process. Academic researchers and financial journalists can theorize all they want about efficient markets and rational behavior. Those of us who've actually run large corporations know better. The quarterly reporting system is broken, and defending it based on theoretical models and incomplete data serves no one except those who profit from short-term volatility. Next time the Wall Street Journal wants to analyze corporate behavior, perhaps they should talk to someone who's actually lived it. The American economy deserves better than academic theory masquerading as practical wisdom.

Compare this to a single stock – Oracle Corporation adding $255 billion to its market cap within few hours on September 10! The message from investors is clear: The AI mania is running up and strong. The software giant grabbed headlines when its shares gained 36 per cent on September 10. With this massive move up, the stock added over $255 billion to its market cap – joining the exclusive club of stocks that have gained $250 billion or more in a single day. Other members of the coveted club are Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft. What triggered this euphoria in Oracle shares? The company had reported results for Q1 FY26 on September 9 after market close. However, it wasn’t earnings that pleased the street. While its net profit came in line with expectations, revenue reported a slight miss. What, in fact, surprised the street was the company’s grand plans for scaling up its cloud infrastructure business, a whopping 14 times by FY30 – from $10.2 billion in revenue in FY25 to $144 billion. In other words, this is a compounded growth rate of 70 per cent between FY25 and FY30. As the AI race continues full steam, it appears Oracle doesn’t want to be left behind. With large language models (LLMs) being built and upgraded left, right and centre, there is heavy demand for data centres that have the compute (processing power) to support this. This is exactly where Oracle and its cloud infrastructure business come in. The company offers cloud-based compute, storage and networking services to clients. Simply put, clients can make use of Oracle’s high-performance cloud servers to deploy applications based on AI. During the said quarter, the company signed multiple multi-year, multi-billion-dollar contracts (largely under the cloud infrastructure vertical), taking the RPO (remaining performance obligations) figure to $455 billion, which is all the more the main reason for the rally. Readers can understand RPO as order backlog for now. This is a rise of 359 per cent year on year and 230 per cent quarter on quarter. RPO is further expected to reach $500 billion in the next few months. For context, Oracle’s FY25 revenue was $57.4 billion. Though the company is making the right moves to make the most of AI-led demand, there are a few factors that are noteworthy here. First, RPOs represent contracted revenue that is yet to be recognised. Revenue can be recognised only if Oracle could discharge its contractual obligations when the time comes. Thus the $455-billion RPO is not an absolute guarantee that it would translate to future revenue. Contract cancellations and unfavourable modifications to the contract terms could result in material write-down of RPOs. Second, Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle has struck a $300-billion deal with OpenAI, likely spanning over five years from 2027. Now, looking at this in tandem with the $455-billion RPO figure, it leads one to believe that much of the future revenue is tied to one single client – giving room for concentration risk. What is even more concerning is the fact that OpenAI is a cash-burning start-up, run on venture capital, with about $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, per media reports. Third, while the company appears to have a robust road-map for the cloud infrastructure business, there isn’t relatively as much clarity as to the future of the rest of the businesses. Currently, the cloud infrastructure business accounts for just 17 per cent of overall revenue based on FY25. In the last five quarters, this vertical has clocked year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of 51 per cent on average. This, while the rest of the verticals have grown at a mere 2.5 per cent. While such concerns linger, the market’s reaction appears premature and running ahead of fundamentals. Even in the last five years, the company’s execution record has not been strong relative to its stock price performance. On an absolute basis, while earnings have grown 23 per cent on an absolute basis over that of FY20, stock price during the same period has risen close to 400 per cent. Even before the 36 per cent jump last week, the stock was trading at a trailing PE of 54x, which is not inexpensive. As of September 19, it trades at a PE of 69x. All things considered, this very simply reflects investors’ euphoric bet on anything linked to AI. But is it turning into a bubble, one that is reminiscent of the dotcom bust? Before addressing the pertinent question, investors first need to understand the sheer size of economic interest involved in the ongoing AI race. Here’s some crazy statistic. Since January 2020, the market cap of the S&P 500 index has risen $31 trillion. On another hand, the top 10 AI stocks, that are part of the index, have added $18 trillion to their combined market cap. These include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Oracle, Broadcom and Palantir. This is saying, the worth of just 2 per cent of the index’s stocks have grown equivalent to 60 per cent of the index’s gains, while the rest 98 per cent got the short end of the stick (40 per cent). Also, currently, the market cap of these stocks put together is as large as 40 per cent of S&P 500’s market cap. Further, the current AI surge demands unprecedented capital expenditure, as companies compete to build the computational infrastructure. These include real estate for data centres, the cutting-edge GPUs and related cooling systems and network hardware. In the past few years, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle (in descending order of quantum of capex; referred to as Big 5 in this article) have been large spenders on capex. Together, the Big 5 have invested an aggregate of $586 billion over the last three fiscals. They are expected to incur about $860 billion in the next two years. This is almost as big as how much the US spends on defence every year. Historically, the Big 5 have been asset-light businesses. However, with capex picking up lately, their combined fixed assets turnover ratio (only tangible assets considered) has gradually declined year on year to almost half of what it was 10 years ago — from 4.6 times to 2.2 times now. To put it in perspective, if one were to assign the multiple of 4.6x to the capex expected to be incurred in 2025 – about $400 billion (see chart), the expectation is that there should be an incremental revenue of $1,850 billion. However, the combined revenue of the Big 5 in the recently-concluded fiscal was only about $1,500 billion and it has taken decades since these companies were incorporated to reach such a scale. Even at the lower end of the multiple – at 2.2 times, incremental revenue required out of the capex would work out to $880 billion by end of FY25. For context, the combined revenue of the cloud verticals of the Big 5 is just about $250 billion today. Even if one were to assume that incremental revenue will kick in with a lag, the argument does come across as a hard sell, especially with these figures. Another statistic that brings out how big the AI capex has become for the economy is the one from the US’ Bureau of Economic Analysis. It measures the contribution of segments of the economy to the overall GDP every quarter. For example, if the GDP growth (real) rate during the quarter is 3 per cent and the contribution of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) reads 1 per cent, then it means that PCE has contributed to a third of incremental GDP. Similarly, for the recently-concluded quarter (Q2 2025), GDP growth was 3.3 per cent, but contribution of gross private domestic investment came in at -2.7 per cent. However, contribution of investment in information processing equipment and software (tech capex), which form part of gross private domestic investment, stood at 0.8 per cent. This shows that despite a slowdown in the overall private capex in the economy, tech capex has stood resilient. For lack of further detailed classification, information processing equipment and software have been considered here, which can be safely assumed to be substantially driven by the ongoing AI, data centre capex. If one were to construct a two-quarter moving average line of this contribution to GDP measure, in the recent quarter, the contribution of tech capex to GDP (1.1 per cent) has, in fact, surpassed the contribution of PCE to GDP (0.7 per cent) for the first time, in the quarters analysed since 2022. This is big, especially when you consider the fact that PCE accounts for about 70 per cent of US’ GDP. Considering the above pointers, it is quite clear that the AI mania is now just too big to fail. Whether it is the wealth effect and its consequent positive impact on economic growth or their hard capex driving a good chunk of the economy or the investor sentiment riding upon these companies, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders that expected revenues start flowing in. Looking ahead, AI is still an evolving technology and so, the picture looks murky today. One, there isn’t yet concrete evidence proving efficiency gains from use of AI would be attractive and cost effective enough to drive healthy adoption in enterprises. Two, while LLMs are being trained by spending on bleeding edge GPUs, there are noticeable positive developments with smaller models that wouldn’t require as much compute as LLMs, sometimes possible even without GPUs – raising the question as to what is the right level of capex. Three, today broadly AI is being used in applications such as summarisation, generative media, transcription and others – where the AI models do not appear to stand differentiated from one another. Sure, AI has found use-cases such as support services, pharmaceutical research and so on. However, the single most important application for AI in the next decade – which could be robotics or autonomous driving, for example, are not yet on the horizon when it comes to mass deployment. On considering the above, the valuations of top AI stocks today are not cheap, with all except Nvidia and Amazon trading at PE ratios above five-year averages. Palantir’s market cap is $433 billion, while its revenue is just $2.9 billion. Outside the top 10, stocks like AMD, ARM Holdings trade at PE ratios of 86x and 172x respectively. CoreWeave, a recently-listed cloud services company, is yet to turn profitable but is a $61-billion unit, with revenue and net loss of $1.9 billion and $863 million (FY24). In the unlisted space, AI start-ups are raking in capital from VC/PE funds at lofty valuations. Entities from within the AI value chain have become backers in some cases. Case in point, Microsoft’s, Amazon’s and ASML’s investment in OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral respectively. All three are cash-burning start-ups valued at about $300 billion, $180 billion and $14 billion respectively (per known latest funding rounds). This exuberance does make one reminiscent of the infamous dotcom bubble of 2000 – when anything that had ‘Internet’ stamped on it was selling like hot cakes, even at unreasonable valuations. Right before the bubble burst in March 2000, the S&P 500 reached a PE ratio of 29.5x – never to see a rerating to such levels until April 2021, which too lasted only briefly. Today, its PE is reasonably close to such levels at 26x. However, the current market cap (of S&P 500) to GDP ratio stands at 2x, much worse than about 1.3x in March 2000. Even on a forward earnings basis, the index and almost all top AI stocks trade at PEG (price to earnings growth) ratios of over 2x, which appear unsustainable, all things considered. Though AI presents a structural opportunity to bet on, investors need to be extremely watchful of valuations as they can make all the difference. Investors will be better served waiting for now, in search of better entry points with higher margin of safety. As the AI craze continues to heat up, it is worth pondering on this quote from John Hussman, a fund manager who was prescient in his prediction of the dot com crash: Valuations often matter suddenly, and with a vengeance. This is a lesson best learnt before a crash rather than after one. In the interest of how much depends on AI investment and wealth effect, one will have to hope this time is truly different!

The advice doing the rounds that Indian investors ought to go big on US stocks to avoid ‘losing money’ from rupee depreciation, is the latest example. Their arguments are on the following lines. # If you’ve earned an 18 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from your domestic equity funds in the last five years, don’t be too happy. After adjusting for rupee depreciation, your returns are just 13 per cent. The rupee has been losing 3-4 per cent against the US dollar for the last many decades. The only way to shield your portfolio from this is to invest in US markets. # The AI revolution is sweeping the world. As AI replaces humans across industries, many Indian industries will be disrupted. Stay safe by investing in US Magnificent 7 companies. There’s a grain of truth in each of these statements; but it’s no more than a grain. If you’re thinking of making a wholesale switch from Indian stocks to the US ones, look before you leap. Investing a small portion of your portfolio in dollar-denominated assets to fund your overseas expenditure is a good idea. But this is a particularly bad time to replace your Indian equity allocations with US equities, hoping to earn a higher return or gain from dollar appreciation. Let’s first look at why Indian investors need to stick with rupee assets. Buy what you know: Globally, even professional and institutional investors have a home-country bias. That is, they invest the bulk of their portfolio in assets denominated in the currency of their home country. US investors stick by dollar assets and Chinese investors prefer yuan-denominated assets. This is quite simply because you get the best results from investing in what you understand. An Indian investor has a greater shot at understanding and tracking the Indian economy, consumers, companies and government policy, than the US economy, its consumers or government policy. When professional investors or institutions invest outside their home country, they think of this as a risk and hedge against it. USD weakening: It is also dangerous to expect the dollar to deliver 3-4 per cent gains against the rupee like clockwork. Yes, over the last three decades, the rupee has lost ground against the dollar at a 3-4 per cent annualised rate. This is because India has consistently run a current account deficit and needed foreign capital inflows to fund it. But there’s no guarantee that rupee depreciation will continue at this rate to perpetuity. If a shrinking current account deficit, a healthy economy, improving sovereign ratings or attractive stock valuations or bond yields woo back foreign investors to India, this can slow the pace of rupee depreciation. In fact, the dollar index is down 10 per cent since the beginning of 2025, on tariff turbulence and rate cut expectations. US policymakers are, today, keen to allow the dollar to weaken substantially, so that US exports can be made more competitive. Mirror your expenses: The basic purpose of financial planning is to fund your future expenses. If your future expenses such as buying a home or setting up a pension fund are going to be in rupees, your investments need to be rupee-denominated too. Yes, rupee depreciation can indirectly peg up your expenses if imported goods such as crude oil, gold, industrial metals or edible oils get costlier. But all this gets captured in domestic inflation numbers. As long as you plan your investments to beat inflation, the currency impact on your daily expenses is taken care of. You need dollar assets in your portfolio only to the extent of financial goals that will entail spending in dollars. If you plan to tour the US, enrol in a US master’s programme, pursue higher education for your child in American universities, that portion of your portfolio needs to be invested in dollar assets. Switching from Indian stocks to US stocks today, based on valuation concerns, is akin to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Here’s why. * As the Indian market has enjoyed a breathless bull run since Covid, the US market has rallied right alongside it. In the five years to September 2025, while the Nifty50 has gained 120 per cent, Nasdaq100 Index is up 127 per cent and US S&P 500 112 per cent. Yes, Indian markets have turned expensive after this rally with the Nifty50 at a 22 PE and the Nifty500 at 25. But then so has the US market, which now appears over-valued by most metrics. The Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP) for the US hovers at 217 per cent against the fair level of 100 per cent. S&P index’ trailing PE of 26 times is well above the long-term average of 18. The forward PE of 25 stacks up against the long-term average of 17. Therefore, if Indian stocks can get derated on earnings disappointments, so can US stocks. * After a post-Covid boom, the Indian economy has normalised to 6.5-7 per cent growth rate. The US economy is, however, on the verge of a sharp slowdown. Last week, US Fed members projected that GDP growth could slow down to 1.6 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 from 2.8 per cent in 2024. With government spending cuts, US jobs growth has fallen off a cliff in recent months with monthly non-farm payrolls averaging 29,000 in June-August 2025 against 82,000 same time last year. The impact of these job losses on consumer spending and the economy is yet to play out. It is hard to believe at this juncture that tariff flip-flops, job losses and the spending slowdown that follows will have no impact on US corporate earnings. Whether Fed rate cuts will make up for all this remains to be seen. * Unlike the Indian government, which has been cutting back on borrowings post-Covid, the US has been binge-borrowing, with its debt at $37 trillion and debt-GDP ratio at over 120 per cent now. US bond market yields have been highly volatile in the last one year and are at present above the levels at which they were when the Federal Reserve started cutting rates in September 2024. Rising bond yields ratchet up the cost of borrowings for the US government and companies, and can spook capital flows. Global central banks have been diversifying away from the dollar into gold holdings in recent times. * A popular argument for investing in US equities is that no other market offers the opportunity to own a piece of global hyper-scalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Amazon. This is true. The Magnificent Seven, thanks to their technological prowess and the global dominance of their platforms, have managed scorching growth rates in revenues, profits and cash flows over the past decade. In recent years, they have invested eye-watering sums in AI capex, building up hopes that rising AI adoption will drive the next leg of supernormal growth for these companies. It is thanks to these expectations that the market capitalisation of Magnificent 7 stocks has rocketed to $21 trillion, nearly five times India’s GDP. Just seven stocks now make up 34 per cent of US stock market capitalisation. Mag 7 stocks have belted out a 38 per cent CAGR in the last 10 years. But after a decade of scorching earnings growth and even more scorching stock price performance, some market veterans are beginning to question if the hyper-scaler story has been stretched too far. There are worries about whether AI monetisation will lag capex, and if Mag 7 companies will end up decimating both their cash flows and shareholder returns in their pursuit of GenAI. Comparisons are beginning to be made to the infamous 1999-2000 dotcom bubble (See Big Story). Therefore, Indian investors who need dollar exposures in their portfolio because of specific goals, should explore stocks outside the Mag 7 and gold at this juncture. Others should stick to Indian equities and bide their time on overseas diversification. Published on September 20, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: ‘Open Up The Floodgates’—A BlackRock Price Bombshell Is Suddenly Hurtling Toward Bitcoin And Crypto

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto have exploded back this year, largely thanks to BlackRock-led Wall Street adoption and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (though fears have emerged of a bitcoin price “death spiral”). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price topped $124,000 per bitcoin last month, though its early 2025 rally has stalled in recent months, just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issued a stark $37 trillion warning. Now, as Goldman Sachs quietly admits to growing fears over the U.S. dollar, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a major rule change that could mean the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) “floodgates” open. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run This week, the SEC voted in favor of proposed rule changes by three national securities exchanges, allowing them to adopt generic listing standards for new crypto ETFs. The SEC approval "will open up the floodgates," Steve Feinour, a partner at Stradley Ronon, told Reuters. “The big trigger this week was the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards for crypto ETFs on the likes of NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe,” Nic Puckrin, macroeconomics analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “Until now, every ETF had to go through a lengthy, case-by-case process. Now, new products can be listed in just 75 days. This is significant for funds tied to ethereum, solana and dogecoin, or even diversified crypto baskets, as it dramatically reduces the barriers.” Alongside the rule change and proving there is demand for crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and ethereum, the first U.S. ETFs to offer spot exposure to Ripple’s XRP and dogecoin started trading on Thursday, generating about $55 million in trading volume. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on Cboe under the ticker XRPR, saw the largest debut volume of any ETF launch this year, according an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market In August, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci said it makes “zero sense" for BlackRock to ignore cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and ethereum. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying bitcoin and ethereum are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” Geraci posted to X. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF exploded onto Wall Street in early 2024, becoming the fastest growing ETF ever and now holds almost 750,000 bitcoin worth $88 billion on behalf of investors. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024. BlackRock’s fund alone holds almost 4% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

So the key points are: – It will now cost $100k to apply for an H-1B visa – This rule is in force for 12 months and will cease to apply unless renewed (these two points are being incorrectly reported in some places as a $100k annual fee) – If you are well connected, you can get the government to agree to an exemption on either an individual, company or industry basis. Assuming this goes ahead, it’s going to kill the Infosys/Wipro model pretty much dead (not that anybody will shed tears for it). It would probably also harm the big US tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, except that Trump claims they’re supportive, so if he’s not blowing smoke then that probably means they have their Section 2c exemptions lined up already. As for smaller businesses (namely any without a hotline to the Secretary of Homeland Security) H-1B will be pretty much dead for them as well.

Removing 12 m dose will result in massive resurgence of measles, which can be predicted mathematically. 1/2’ Meanwhile, in other news- https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-20/measles-outbreak-queensland-growing-middlemount-case/105798134 https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/measles-alert-for-sydney-after-returned-traveller-from-indonesia-tests-positive/news-story/e41a38690a7f477d2249a21bc3731847 https://thewest.com.au/news/public-health/measles-alert-fifo-workers-urged-to-check-vaccinations-as-new-wa-measles-cases-emerge-c-20059264 News at 11. Yeah, measles vaccination isn’t perfect, but it sure beats the alternatives. The measles vaccination schedule in Australia works like this: – if you were born before 1966 you almost certainly have immunity from getting measles as a kid, and don’t need to be vaccinated. – if you were born between 1966 and 1994 you almost certainly had one dose of measles vaccine as a kid, and have 95% percent chance of being immune. – if you were born after 1994 you almost certainly got (or will get) two doses of vaccine, and have (will have) a 99% percent chance of being immune. – if you’re in the 1966 to 1994 group, you should get a second shot if you work in healthcare, schools or childcare, or are close to someone vulnerable (eg immunocompromised, elderly) – if you’ve come to Australia from overseas and don’t have evidence of vaccination you should get two shots. The people infected in the outbreaks you highlight are almost certainly: – born between 1966 and 1994, and only had one shot; – kids who haven’t had their second shot yet; or – people from overseas who haven’t had two shots (or measles as a kid) – vaccine avoiders These are outbreaks, not epidemics. They involve a few people, but don’t spread much. They’re rare enough to make the national news. https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/measles/Pages/measles-vax-qanda.aspx The company I used to work for used H1bs for a while then they decided to buy an office in India. No more H1bs anymore. Funny thing, the company has no business in India only USA, but they enjoy the special privileges of their business type classification all the while paying engineers in India a pittance compared to the USA. Quality shows after reporting of a 100% turnover rate in the India office and several failed projects. But they keep doing it. I was laid off at 59 from a large multi-national American company that everyone here has heard of and probably has one of their products. I was let go, along with about 113 others, in the second wave of cuts back in 2017. There were more cuts after that. Our entire IT department had been outsourced to an Indian company, and it cost us tons of American and local jobs, not sure how many. My boss, who worked at the corporate Mothership told me the engineering tech center, which we were a part of, had been “invaded” by H1B people. His words, not mine. They took over most of these jobs that were lost. I was replaced by one. The company was trying to get younger (and cheaper) it seems. By law, as I was told, they had to show us who was getting the axe, their ages, and who wasn’t. All, and I mean all, of the 113 were 58 to 64. One job class had 6 layoffs, all 63 or 64. We had 45 days to sign the separation agreement or get nothing. You could not sue the company for age discrimination (this was in bold). You could not work, due to confidentiality agreements, in the same field for 1 year. We got insurance for about 6 months, a pissy little severance, a pat on the ass, and a see ya. Funny, same day I get whacked, corporate reported record earnings, their stock went up about 17 percent that day, (layoff notices probably helped) and they announced a 4 million dollar expansion to our manufacturing facility. They did most of the hiring for factory labor through staffing contractors, for the record. A lean mean money making machine. Too bad you didn’t get a lawyer. The part about not being able to sue the company for age discrimination sounds illegal, or at least evidence of deception as that is not the law in my state. Sounds like intimidation. You always have the right to sue unless you signed that away in some sort of binding arbitration clause, which may or may not be legal. Of course, whether a lawsuit would succeed is another matter, but I have heard from several employment lawyers that just threatening to sue suddenly results in a lot bigger severance offer appearing like manna from Heaven. It just so happened my girlfriend at the time worked for a law firm. One of their lawyers offered to look it over for me. He gave me a few tips on what I might be able to negotiate with them – age discrimination not one of them. He said there was nothing I could do. I tried to negotiate on some other things. They told me to sign it or STFU. I don’t know if living in Ohio has anything to do with it. I’m told Ohio has some kind of law that you can fire someone for little or no reason and there is no recourse. I don’t know if this is true, but…. I have a family member who is fighting cancer. She’s has just spent the last few months in chemo. It’s knocking the shit out of her, to be blunt. She had 3 treatments to go and she got fired from her job, and lost her insurance. She worked from home, which was lucky for her, but not now. They said there was nothing they can do. They are not only afraid of what will happen with her health, but afraid they will now lose their house. Don’t get old or sick… I’m sorry about your family member. That’s awful. Did she look into taking FMLA medical leave? That’s the law, and while they don’t have to pay you while you’re on leave, they have to at least restore you to your position when you return from the mandatory leave period, or put you in a comparable one. And while they can technically fire you 3 seconds after giving you your old job back for cause, well, that looks very bad in court. Like, “retaliation” bad. Employment lawyers love that stuff. As so often is the case with the law, there are lots of grey areas to keep lawyers employed. When I got laid off in 2022, the company made a big show of publishing the ages of everyone on the list, including myself. I was the oldest. I did negotiate a better deal for myself, almost by accident (long story for another day.) Perhaps you wouldn’t have had a case, but you’d be surprised what being served does to people. Having a process server march into corporate HQ and demand to see the head of HR with a stack of papers gets their attention. Just to save the legal costs, they’ll change their tune like Tweety Bird! I don’t know about the FMLA stuff. Too late now anyway. They are just trying to cope, move on and hope for the best. Thanks for that just the same. I didn’t fight the layoff. I found work within a month. That got me to 62 and got laid off again. At that age, in my field, you are no longer employable so, like it or not, I took early retirement while trying to find a job which I didn’t. I’m sorry to here about these bouts of economic terrorism. One thing that Naked Capitalism has taught me: there but for the grace of God go I. (A phrase I actually picked up from the Earl Dumarest SciFi series of books by Tubb. Kind of entertaining, but a bit repetitive with extremely 1-dimensional female characters.) But it’s hard to prepare for every contingency in neoliberalism. You do the best that you can. Stay safe! Not my area of expertise (most things aren’t) but found this interesting breakdown by percentage of H1B holders in various industries. https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/reports/OLA_Signed_H-1B_Characteristics_Congressional_Report_FY2023.pdf (List on page 13 of the PDF) Had no idea the vast majority of them (65%) are in tech. Can see why that industry could use this change to allow more opportunities for American workers. Curious what this will do to already labor-starved industries like hospitals though. From my experience at two different companies, they wanted them because they were cheaper. Allow me to explain one example. This was a different multi-national than the one above, but still the same IMO. Our engineering department wanted to ship our work to a company in India. We had a couple of dozen in the department that was targeted. When they told us it was just for those times when we were too busy and time to market was important. We needed more people. We didn’t buy this. It was about replacing us at some point. Once they told us the plan, I did some research and created a proposal that proved, making some changes to our process, and some additional training and cost (hardware) we could in fact handle these peak demands. I took the presentation to one of the brain(less) trust. I laid it all out, piece by piece, proving we would be wasting money by outsourcing our jobs and/or labor, even for peak demand. He let me finish, laughed, and said; “I can get three of those people for one of you, why do I need you.” At least he was honest. To make a long story short, we hired a Indian company. They sent a couple people over here. We trained them over the next 6 to 8 months, then they went back and trained 8 or 10 of their people, who began doing our work. Within 6 months, our department lost some people, but our workload didn’t change. We spent as much time checking, and FIXING, their work as if we would have just done it ourselves. It probably took a year, and who knows how much money spent, to finally figure out (and admit) this was a truly bad experiment. They fired the other company, then of course we had to find new people to hire because we got rid of some we had. The company lost their butts. We only shook our heads. Another giant cluster by our corporate overlords. This is similar to my own experience. Former employer not only went looking for engineers in India, but actually had an office building constructed in Bangalore. We learned via a manager who talked too much that they were salivating at the prospect of getting engineers at one-third the cost (i.e., the same “three of those people for one of you” ratio). Management was even brazen enough to send us some CVs, asking: “can this person do your job?” I happened to see one of these CVs. Degree in “Software Configuration” from M.I.T., which in this case meant the Madras Institute of Technology. But what struck me was that the candidate had worked for eight different companies in the past two years. At first, this was a head-scratcher. We told management: “this person cannot do the job without training. We could hire and train them, but given their work history, why would we expect them to hang around?” Needless to say, these management decisions had a severe impact on morale and a number of the best engineers left the company. And then I heard from management that things in India weren’t working out so well. They would hire somebody, and then on the appointed starting date, the new hire wouldn’t show up. The office would phone them, only to learn — “oh, sorry, I forgot to inform you” — the new hire already had taken another job somewhere else. It seems that very often when a person was hired, they would immediately put that on their CV and go looking for another job at higher pay. There were some other things that went quite contrary to US management expectations, and within a couple of years the office in India was closed, the building was sold, and the whole adventure was forgotten. In my last role I had to do some IT recruiting over a period of 3 years to keep my team staffed up. I went for permanent hires and intra-company transfers when I could but sometimes had to look further afield, or we sometimes had people thrust upon us (as a “favour”). This was 12 -15 years ago. I found that we had two sorts of analyst programmers hired with an Indian background. On the one hand there were the guys who were a dream to work with, hard working, capable, curious to learn and easy to get on with. Then there were the rest: Capable with huge egos and attitude. Or Semi-capable with huge egos and attitude, bristled at having errors pointed out Or Those who wouldn’t take directions from women or work with women, which was a problem in a team with women programmers Or The really genial guys who used their captivating personalities to charm their way out of doing any work at all – the rest of the team just loved these guys /s Lastly you had the quiet, retiring guys who weren’t sure how they got the job, and mostly would not have been able to find their way out of a wet paper bag. I realised later that the Indian body shops wrote a lot of the resumes to obscure lack of experience, education fudges and the like. So it doesnt surprise me at all that IT work outsourced to India could become a nightmare of redoing work and fixing problems when it was delivered back to the company. “Charlie Kirk Update and, As Predicted, Europe Snapbacks on Iran” ‘This means that snapback has now been officially ACTIVATED, and that UN sanctions against Iran will take effect at 8pm EST on September 27th. However, China and Russia issued a joint statement following the vote and officially announced that they consider the snapback of UN sanctions against Iran to be illegal and invalid, and that they will not abide by them. In other words, they will continue to do business with Iran as usual, regardless of UN sanctions. I suspect the other BRICS nations will adopt the same position.’ I find this a remarkable development. The European countries activated snapback sanctions without following the required legal steps first. So now Russia, China and other countries are just going to ignore those UN sanctions on the grounds of them being illegal and are not going to let Iran be isolated. I’m willing to bet that most countries know how it went down and so will privately at least take Iran’s side. In their hast to activate those UN sanctions, it is leading to a situation where they will no longer be so effective anymore. Re: How Climate Change Is Increasing Landslide Risk Worldwide I’ve been in Himachal Pradesh (N. India) the last month and seen loads of footage of huge landslides here, and in Ladakh.

Trump only believes in deal where he comes out the winner and other countries lose i.e. zero-sum games. For Xi to come right out and talk about win-win scenarios sounds like XI saying that he is not going to play that game and that Trump will have to change accordingly. The world anxiously awaits the arrival of the first fourth comma Illionaire, how many gotten gains can one man accrue before taking a dirt nap?

Cousin Eddie and Hamburger Helper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkExpbnjsX8 It’s so strange people striving to be the first trillionaire when it would make little difference in their lives if they could do it. We, except for an entry in the ‘Guinness Book of records” that is. Look at that 1985 film “Brewster’s Millions”- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCoGAZJQGmU (1:22 mins) And imagine challenging any person to spend a billion dollars in the space of, say, a year with nothing to show for it. Could it be even done? For these hundreds of billionaires, it sounds like that old game of ‘the person that dies with the most toys, wins.’ The 85 film is a remake of a 45 movie that might be a remake of a forgotten silent film. It’s an odd story. I don’t know if Richard Pryor was just hired for the remake or had an interest in the story. Older than that. It was originally a 1902 comedic novel and has been made into a film about a dozen times with the first one being made in 1914 by Cecil De Mille- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster's_Millions They should read about Dives and Lazarus. Its about the race to buy the most governments and politicians – a mere billion doesn’t go that far anymore! Quite. After the first $100 million it’s totally about the power. A movie that brings memories to the long gone VHS era. As far as billionaires go, you’ve missed the point. They don’t want money in order to spend money. They want more money, in order to have more money. Regular people can not understand mind of psychopat. Asking them why they need more money, is like asking serial killers why they need to kill more people. I can yet again attest to rising grocery prices here in the North American Deep South. I did the weekly shopping yesterday. As usual I ‘visited’ seven emporia in my perambulations. Live produce has hit a new and higher plateau. Cauliflower are now three dollars a head. Grapes are $2.95 a pound. Squash are also creeping up on three dollars a pound. The ‘standard’ smallish Industrial Grade avocados are running $1.25 each. (Industrial Grade because they are hard enough to build walls with. Organic bricks.) The choice of vegetables available has also shrunk. Items on other aisles have risen in price lately as well. That old Poverty Row staple, Top Cheap Ramen has risen to $.75 a packet. Mac and Cheese is now $1.25 a box. Chips, (not a staple, but a standard “comfort food,”) is up to around three dollars a bag, for the off brands. Many of the name brands are pushing five dollars a bag. Carbonated drinks are fizzing up again. Coca Cola brand is now ranging around $5.49 a six pack of .5 litre bottles. Two litre bottles of the same are retailing for $2.59 each. I have had to re-learn Mom’s habit of checking the coupons weekly and now perusing the weekly online sales at the various chain grocers. I still refuse to use phone apps. It is bad enough that I use a “Frequent Shopper” plan, really, surveillance program, at a chain store. As an example, I buy catfish fillets, locally sourced no less, from a big chain. I wait until they put it on “Buy One Get One” sale. Thus, I end up buying a couple of pounds of the little fishies for $5.49 a pound instead of the “normal” $10.99 a pound. I freeze the bulk of them individually in sandwich bags bathed in some distilled water with a squeeze of lemon. That assumes continued electricity service. When the grid goes down, or gets switched to favouring Surveillance State Data Centres, I might have to re-learn the joys of kippered herrings. (Mom fixed those regularly when we were young.) Anyway, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it. Stay safe. Thanks for the Store Provides Quality Ramen report, plebs can’t be pleased by the stagflation, did you happen to see any venison flavored instant noodles? No, the Imperium doesn’t have the Gaul to try providing that flavour ramen yet. Although, I would not be surprised to see, due to the cachet of the flavour ingreedient that this item would be deer indeed. ¢enturian, $tone $oup always works if you can lift some condiment sachets from the mini-mart petrol station. At my food co-op, organic olive oil (Spain, 33.8 fl oz) just went up another 20% after a previous 30% rise. There are other things as well. Maybe tariffs? It’s a tax, donchano. Crikey! I’ve mentioned it before, and we seem to get a celestial Kessler Effect on inflation, when foodstuffs go up it sets off the cost of a muffler repair, not to mention the cost of a perm going up too. I’ve only ever seen what I would call quite strident inflation, in Mexican markets in the 1980’s. I remember seeing cans of food with about 20 price stickers on top of one another, to better reflect the new replacement cost-which was always rising. My Mr. Cynic is screaming in my ear that having the price of food be a major percentage of the ‘average’ person’s income is the old-fashioned way of maintaining control over said persons. When your main interest is centred on where your next meal is coming from, things like the World and politics take a back seat. We seem to be entering yet again the world of “bread and circuses.” Be safe. Cynic is just a cheap attempt at being a soundalike palindrome, but you’re right. We all tend to buy the same foodstuffs over and over again, so everybody has a good idea of how inflation is hitting them. I always try and get Les @ the WinCo supermarket when I’m checking out, as he’s a glutton for punishment being a Raiders fan a few years older than me, and handy to blame inflation on (a running joke between us) as well. All those increases stupid CPI never notices, we pay through the nose. I understand that of late, the Raiders, a very appropriate name for an Oligarch Party mascot, have a joke of a running game. Yet the ticket prices keep going up. All those increases stupid CPI never notices, we pay through the nose. a timeless quotable So as to not be misunderstood with my first world woes (albeit woeful): Everyday, everyday, I have the blues, the Genocide Blues… To be countered by Team Blood Red. Ever get the feeling that on some days species extinction would be an acceptable option? Plus, I will propose that much of what claims to be the “Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave” is now a Second World polity. Be continuing safe. Food prices in Bulgaria and Europe have been going through the roof for some time now. It’s even more amazing that many foods cost more in Bulgaria now than the exact same thing in Germany, despite much lower incomes. Yet the political class is busy telling us not to believe our lying wallets. It’s nuts. I wonder what the sources of those foodstuffs are? Is Bulgaria capable of feeding itself today? Also, what about fertilizer inputs? Since the dislocations of the Russo-Ukraine War, I have read that fertilizer, a traditional export of both Russia and the Ukraine, has been in “short” supply in the West. I realize that the Jeffersonian Yeoman Farmer was a myth even back then, but Industrialized agriculture in America has passed its optimum concentration level. Very often, bigger is not better. Stay safe. Bulgaria is capable of feeding itself but it isn’t. EU and national policies encourage farmers to produce a lot of wheat for export, while local fruit, vegetable and livestock growers can’t compete with imports from elsewhere on the EU and from Turkey. Cartels are also bankrupting dairy farmers, buying milk for below cost and selling dairy products for an arm a leg (never mind that they also often contain milk powder, palm oil and lots of water). It’s rather grim to anticipate how the prices are bound to go up again when the Euro is introduced on January 1st. That seems nuts! Given Bulgaria’s climate zone (I think) you’d figure that Bulgaria should have very productive agriculture, esp in fruits and vegetables! That Turkey, of all countries (talking about climate, not history) should be exporting agricultural goods displacing the locals seems to confirm my hunch… What idiot agreed to introduce the Euro? This also sounds like the supposed “plot” by Stalin to ‘manage’ the agricultural economy of what is now the Ukraine back in the 1920s and 1930s. From what I have read, that plan was all about international flows. Just like today? Maybe the “opposition” politicians can arrange for some Russian Autarky Specialists to do a tour of Bulgaria. That should stir up the EU a bit. If worst comes to worst, is there still a Hapsburg family around to base the New Austrian Empire upon? Or does the Divine Porte want to reconstitute the old Ottoman Empire all the way to the gates of Vienna? Stay safe. One of my Austrian acquaintances likes to remind me that Rudolf von Habsburg was a Swiss, or rather, the original Habsburg castle (Rudolf’s) is in Switzerland. I think there are actually quite a few Habsburg descendants in European politics now, in different countries. Not sure where they fit in today’s Europe, though (they have generally been very pro European integration and the Habsburgs traditionally never have liked Russia or Orthodoxy much, ever.) The legend of William Tell tells you what the Swiss thought of the Habsburgs later I always thought the Habsburg experience in Switzerland, esp given all their later territorial expansion (esp under Charles V) hilariously funny. They were kicked out of their ancestral castle in 1415! (I just looked that up) Oddly, here they’re dumping soda as fast as they can, Pepsi brands in particular are frequently buy 2-3 and get 1 or 2 free. I’ve walked out with 5 for ~ $6.50/ea and they retail for about $10.50 now. They’ve been dumping them this way on and off this entire year. Jellies and jams are quite a price shocker lately, the brand I buy that’s got no HFCS in it is up to $8.50 now; I finally downgraded to another brand after buying it for 8 years. In Massachusetts, food prices are absolutely insane. It had gotten bad, then seemed to level out for a while but now it’s increasing out of control. It’s scary times. These prices sound wonderful, and cheap. I’m in BC Canada and cauliflower is around $6 a head, broccoli $4-5/ pound, butter, the cheap stuff, $8/pound, fishies, well, if they are less than $4/100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) they’re a steal. Gas remains at $1.90/litre so just under $8/gallon. You have no idea. Well you could diversify into roadkill but you need butchering skills. We buy 10 lbs. of ground chuck every 4 months or so. I was SHOCKED to find that the price was the same as it was 4 months ago. We use fully flattened roadkill to fashion frisbees out of. They are an export item in the local economy. Here, alas, road killed deer must be turned over to Wildlife and Fisheries for “disposal.” If you have to make a claim for deer related automobile damage, that Wildlife and Fisheries ticket is your passport to approved status on your claim. Here are the 2025 Ig Nobel Prize winners Improbable (Micael T) Trump’s press secretary stated that the President is very disappointed for not even getting one of these. In Geography? Is that near Cambodia? LOL, I just saw a video of him say Cambodia and Armenia (a bad war that was just starting). That’s a new one, and not to be confused with Aberbaijan and Albania. Next one will probably be Elbonia and Freedonia. Re, “A Japanese debt crisis is closer than you think”, is this a test for those of us who follow MMT? The article reminds me of the Monetarists who woke up after the Covid-induced inflation to claim, “see, we were right all along!” The BoJ has struggled to prevent deflation for decades, and now that they have allowed long term rates to “normalize” (the 10-year rate is almost 1.6%!), the author warns us to “beware of the bond vigilantes and a debt crisis!” Sure thing. Thing is, in Japan some of the super wealthy actually like Japan, so those debts just keep rolling over and those elites just keep collecting yen and interest income. No such luck over here. Interesting story about honeybees that suggests commercial bee colonies and the feral versions that result could be the kudzu of pollinators, overwhelming native solitary bees and thereby having a negative effect on native plants. Here in the South kudzu itself was of course an introduced Asian species and, despite gestures toward eradication, nothing seems to stop it. There is a local outfit that will provide you with goats (confined by temp electric fences) to eat it up. Meanwhile Big Ag seems dependent on the trucked in bees to service their megafarms–with honeybees themselves being threatened by disease and chemicals. Is the bee conflict yet another ecological threat in our ever more populated world? Physical this week. Brief conversation with my primary care physician and he wrote prescriptions for the COVID vaccine for me, my wife, and soon to be 89 y/o mother. My daughter, 40 y/o and grandsons 9 and 11 y/o (who also live in our home) will have to ask their primary. For her part she’s diabetic so we don’t expect resistance, and vaccination for the boys to protect my Mom (and us as well as we near 70). Point being, hopefully we won’t have to doctor shop to get their vaccine prescriptions (money cures most evils and I’ll fly them to another state if needs be). FWIW, we’re in FL so RFK Jr. isn’t the only nutter affecting things because added to his general level of insanity we have a nutcase Governor. Making it worse, his appointed Surgeon General is off the scale (or so in his boss’ pocket he acts the part). But it gets worse, apparently the vaccine schedule we grew up with as kids is out the window. Now parents, with government’s blessing, will be sending unvaccinated children to schools. No clue how long before this blows up with tragic results, but does it really take a scientists to grok this? I am sad for where we are headed. I understand Kennedy’s position of not wanting to force people, e.g. leave it to their civic responsibility to do the right thing but good grief, raise your hand if you think we’re raising a population imbued with civic responsibility . . . anybody? Me? I’m glad for Naked Capitalism. It’s been on the forefront of this information campaign. Not an overreaction to say, we’re maybe alive because of it as we’ve been NOVID during the entire pandemic due to vaccination, plus precautionary masking, yes, still never had COVID, now +5 years since this scourge began. I don’t miss Florida, having grown up there. Glad to hear you’ve still avoided COVID so far. May you never get it. Stay safe! I’m afraid the bonus antidote of the ducks and dog is AI generated. I go to NC to avoid this kind of thing! This is a bonus feature. FFS, and submitted by a reader. I don’t have time or the ability to verify vids. If you are going to bitch like this, I’ll omit bonus antidotes entirely. Please don’t cancel our bonuses. And I would not imagine NC is, as Sutter suggests, dogmatically anti-AI. I’m quite interested in what some artists have done with it. For example there’s a rather good film called Telepathic Letters made entirely using AI images telling the story of the correspondences between H. P. Lovecraft and Fernando Pessoa. There’s a trailer on YouTube but I don’t think it’s freely available yet. In the mean time, have you seen this spectacular AI Retro Rewind? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUFv59R6UFw (19:17) I can’t take my eyes off it. There’s a lot to critique in AI but like any tech the ethics arises in how it is used. I can think of worse uses than getting ducks in row. And while we’re at it, I want to see a video of the lion getting the blow out he’s walking home from in the main antidote. I second that. Please keep rolling out the bonuses. They help remind us of another world. Besides, I see them as a challenge. Lacking the technical skills to identify a fake, I rely on the instantaneous “ick” factor. So far, it’s worked pretty well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley Sometimes they are fun. A few weeks ago I saw a ghimli Jimmy Page with a right hand on the strings and another right hand working the frets. Having techical skills, I can confirm that subconciousnes notices it first. Then the conscius part of the brain tries to explain what is wrong. For example legs of the lion looked off instantly. Then conscius part of of the brain adds info that quadrupedal animals move “diagonal” legs at the same time, and not those at the same side. At second look, the big cat seems to be a three legged beast. There was a bad AI pic of a pretty woman sitting at a table that I saw somewhere: apparently, AI decided that one of the table legs is a human leg, too, so the woman came out 3 legged. Personally, I like AI modded pics. They are fun inways that “real” pics are not. I support and love the antidotes, regular, bonus or (ai) discount. Let the full financial backer who needs no contributions and can pay Yves and staff fabulously extravagant salaries worry about antidote veracity. You lose points for not noticing that third one is AI too. ;-) I had wondered about the third, it seemed not plausible. It seems like AI for that one had lots of movies in its training set. In the first shot, the camera is not rotating but moving like it’s on a dolly. It is also very close while not distracting animals, and above the canyon, and not minding the snow. Animals acting like it’s a live action Disney movie, is just a bonus. :) Second shot looks much more realistic, and could have fooled me. See! We’re sharpening critical thinking skills with AI antidotes. Good thing too as I expect to need AI interpretive skills more and more. “EU floats plan to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine loan, bypassing a Hungary veto” This whole elaborate Jenga Tower of a scheme rests on a simple premise. That this money will be paid back when Russia pays war reparations meaning when they lose. The Ukraine will never pay that money – ever. As soon as that money arrives in that country it will be spent at a rapid clip until it is all gone – poof! – and at that point Zelensky will demand yet more money. The countries that sign up for this ludicrous scheme will be on the hook for all that money and perhaps countries like Hungary may miss the worse aftershocks though no doubt the EU will demand that they chip in a coupla billion for the cause. The best scenario for the EU would be for the Ukraine to quit the war before this scam can be implemented but so long as the money flows, the war will go on. This whole elaborate Jenga Tower of a scheme rests on a simple premise, IBGYBG. Driving out to mother in law’s place in Cumberland county, pa recently, noticed that nobody in cumberland, Lancaster and adjoining counties seems to have planted soybeans this year. Perhaps they had anticipated the results of our clever Chinese trade war. Lotsa soybeans in NW Ohio. Either they didn’t get the memo, or they did get the memo that their man in Washington will be breaking out the checkbook again. I’m in NW Ohio. Centered between Toledo, Cleveland, and Columbus. If I were a soybean farmer I would be really worried about now. We haven’t had rain in almost 3 weeks, and probably longer of any rain that amounted to anything. The crops look bad when driving around the country. I haven’t talked to any farmers, but my buddy did last week. He said the beans look like a bee bee. Not good. Yeah. Trump 1.0 gave $23 billion to the farmers/middle men/exporters he screwed with the tariffs he put on costing AG hugely. https://www.forbes.com/sites/courtneyfingar/2024/09/27/trump-tariffs-failed-to-improve-us-trade-position-in-his-first-term/ “Forests Are Raining Plastic: New Study Reveals Shocking Pollution” Microplastics are as insidious as radiation was through all those nuclear tests last century meaning that all of us are still irradiated as a result of them. Here they are talking about forests being infested with this stuff but so are we as scientists have found microplastics in blood, the brain, the placenta, breast milk, and human bone marrow. Don’t ask me how it gets into our marrow but it does. As I said, this stuff is as insidious as fallout radiation- https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250918225014.htm The richest 10%– Yes, they’re responsible for half the consumption and half the carbon emissions that go along with that consumption. As I reported from perusing my Harvard 50th Anniversary Class Report, the preferred form of conspicuous consumption among that crowd is travel to exotic places, accounting for the fact that tourism is among the fastest growing sources of carbon emissions. Underlining just how blind these people are to what they’re doing was the entry where a Class of ’75-er bragged that his wife was head of the local Climate Action Now! group, and in the very next sentence boasted how often they flew to three different continents, including to India to their ashram. We’re changing the Earth for the worse from the human perspective so Boomer PMCs can bore their friends with their travel stories. Lao-Tzu seems to have anticipated the world of Viking cruises and pilgrimages to the summit of Everest: The farther you go, the less you know. Tao te Ching # 47 (Le Guin rendition) The farther you go, the less you know. We’re encouraged to live up to our wealth, you don’t want to disappoint in living large by needing less, and sharing what has been a glorious experiment in Socialism, thanks to the establishment of our National Parks in 1872, I speak as a 1/329.999.999th co-owner with all of my countrymen. A few years ago I attended this discussion with Karen Armstrong, who was promoting her then-new book Sacred Nature, in which she called for a re-divinization of the environment in order to save it. Obviously I was (and am) interested in the topic, hence my attendance, but as I sat there I couldn’t help but ponder the silliness of listening to someone who’d flown from London to St. Paul, MN discuss the urgent need to save the planet. Did we have no authors closer to home? Well, perhaps none who would draw the type of crowd she did. But aside from her efficacy in mostly filling a theater in the Midwest, did her ideas have enough of an impact to make a difference? How does one know or measure that difference? Is making a difference necessary to justify her air travel, or anyone’s? I am certain Armstrong hasn’t had anything like the environmental impact of the average private plane-user, but I would guess her flying around doing good has had more of an impact than doing good in England would have (she mentions late in the talk of frequently visiting Pakistan, I am guessing as part of her work for the Charter of Compassion). How much impact is any one person allowed to have – more if they are doing important work, less if they are merely curious? The best way to travel is to learn another language. You go to another world, and you can do this without any added carbon emissions as you don’t have to leave home. It is work however. Fun for some :) If English is my another language, does posting here counts as a vacation? At the least it counts as a site seeing tour. Well done Indeed, what’s amazing to me is that, if Climate were taken seriously, literally the lowest hanging fruit is rich people stopping their international and private jet travel. Not banning single use plastic, lolz. While for most people it isn’t worth agonizing over personal carbon emissions, if I didn’t exist, Climate would still happen, rich people uniquely effect the world notably through their consumption patterns. And through their signaling. If living more austerely were suddenly that cool thing to do, as modeled by the elite, it likely would have ripple effects worldwide. But this timeline is stupid. “SITREP 9/19/25: “Russian Incursion” Scare Heats Up as Enfeebled NATO Hobbles to Respond” ‘An Estonian Foreign Affairs Committee chairman did however threaten to shoot down the next Russian jet, ‘cleverly’ invoking the infamous ‘17 seconds’ it took Turkey to shoot down a Russian Su-24 in 2015’ This guy is referring to the time when Erdogan thought it a brilliant idea to have his air force set up a well-planned ambush to shoot down a Russian fighter bomber on a mission is Syria. Erdogan – and Turkiye – paid a heavy price for that idiotic mistake but this Estonian guy is implying that maybe Estonia could also ambush and shoot down a Russian plane as well because what could possibly go wrong. Where do they find these people? And I doubt that it would be the Estonian Air Force trying to do this mission- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_Air_Force#Aircraft My attention went to the speech of a German General saying, according to embedded translation, that “I think we will have gradually to accept the new reality and this new reality means that Ukraine cannot win this war, at least not militarily.” New reality? Well let’s go with it. How can then Ukraine win the war in a non-military fashion? Win in the MSM? That’s easy and the Ukrainians have been “winning” the war in the MSM since the very beginning or even before. Winning to no avail. Ahhh! The sanctions, Russia is still in tatters or worse! Has been in tatters for more than 3 years but they stubbornly continue to fight, and win, the military war. Some may believe that at some point the Russians won’t be able to stand more hysterical barking by the chihuahuas. Perhaps supply the Ukraine w/ shovels and washing machines? The Russkies seem to be doing fine w/ those. He probably thinks that Germany did not lose WW1, at least not militarily, but were stabbed in the back. They never learn. re: EU – Ukraine War FOREIGN AFFAIRS from Sept. 10th alluding to a rather long war by way of outsourcing entirely to EU. Which has already begun as according to Andrei Martyanov e.g. military command has essentially been handed over from the US to the UK. German Anti-Spiegel had the FA text two daysa go There Thomas Röper sums up: “The transatlantic Council on Foreign Relations, which is highly influential in the US, published an article acknowledging the reality that Europeans alone, without the US, should assume security guarantees for Ukraine. On another point, the Council’s sense of reality has not yet prevailed, as its analysts are still demanding that Ukraine be fully integrated into Western structures. They are also still talking about sending European troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire, which means the war will continue for a very long time because Russia will not agree to it. This is bad news for Ukraine and its continued existence as a state.” Here the FA article A Better Way for Europe to Guarantee Ukraine’s Security How European Forces—and NATO Resources—Can Make the Country Stronger Ivo H. Daalder September 10, 2025 https://archive.is/swwgb Ivo Daadler lives in La-la-land. “Any agreement with Russia to end the war must preserve all three of these pillars (the formidable army of Ukraine, commitment of European deployment of substantial air, naval, and ground forces and a true security guarantee by integration of Ukraine in the EU and NATO)” There ain’t be any agreement of that kind with Russia. FA keeps fantasizing again and again. All of these three pillars exist only in Daadler’s imagination. In fact Daadler is in an indirect way saying: Europe, f¬c& you! Oh, all three can be achieved, just not the way people think. 1. There can be a “Group of Forces in Ukraine,” as part of the Russian Army. 2. I strongly suspect that a substantial European contingent has already been committed underground irretrievably in Ukraine. 3. EU and NATO can be reorganized by admitting Russia to both ans expelling US, Canada, and UK from the latter. (/S) I am tired of all the conspiracies around Tyler Robinson and his text messages. The kid has Asperger’s. How do I know? I have Asperger’s and my language is odd and overly formal at times as well. Since he is in his 20’s he most likely was having more psychiatric issues which is common because of the overlapping Asperger’s has with the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia. It is most likely he was having delusions no doubt fueled by internet use. Instead of using this instance as a call for more mental health care it is being twisted into some insane plot by grifters. This comment is an unwarranted attack on this post and the site generally. You are already in moderation and are asking to be blacklisted. There was all of ONE link on Charlie Kirk today (the others were on the Kimmel suspension) and it had NOTHING to do with his texts. And if you are trying to censor other commenters, you have no business doing so. You are no better than anyone else here and are out of line in trying to shut down discussion. I was commenting on the Internet in general. It not against any post here or this website in general. Sorry about the confusion, but as I said, I have Asperger’s and a lot of times my writing does not come across as clearly as I would like. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt that “the conspiracies” you refer to are in general, and not specific to anything originating on this site. I have seen no evidence that the commenters around here are pushing conspiracy theories. These events (mass shootings, assassinations) always seem to inspire conspiracists. In this instance, both sides (left/right) seek to weaponize the event to score political points. If you are on the right, the fact that the shooter allegedly had a trans BF suddenly elevates this from a lone wolf shooting to a vast conspiracy with every purple-haired LGBTQ activist potentially a co-conspirator and threat to humanity. Throw in the buzzword “Antifa” and there you go. Likewise, the left wanted to initially paint Robinson as a right-wing gun nut, given his family history of conservative parents and gun usage. I find both despicable. What I find interesting is how the kid could be so naive as to confess to the crime via text message. For all the stereotypes of youth being super-savvy with tech, why not at least use Snapchat or some secure messaging platform (security being a relative term) like Signal? And why didn’t the romantic interest stop Robinson before he not only confessed, but gave the prosecution evidence of motive? I’d be like “whoa there, hoss, slow down, let’s not get ahead of ourselves, how about dem Yankees?” That at least raises my spidey-sense a bit. I guess there is an innocent explanation – people in general don’t understand how to protect their rights, and even the young can be shockingly naive about how easy it is for law enforcement to get access to their text and phone records. It doesn’t even take a subpoena, especially if they get a hold of the suspect’s phone and can get into it. I wonder if this is how they got the texts? Or did they have to go to the telcos? It might help tamp down on some of the conspiracy theories if the cops released this information. As for your theory on the suspect’s mental health, it is an interesting possibility. I have no particular expertise to add anything other than if I were the kids lawyer, I’d be looking into this as a possible defense, because otherwise, he looks to be cooked. BTW his request would include censoring Max Blumenthal, who has pointed out re the texts: 1. The ones in the charging document dctment have no time stamps. 2. No joke, they are RECONSTRUCTED. That is the FBI’s word. So suspicion is NOT CT and is fully warranted. See this interview starting at 7:55 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3j50GbcT2k “The kid has Asperger’s” Since we’re making blanket requests can I ask that we stop referring to adults as children? I’m tired of the infantilization of adults. I refer to anyone under 30 as “kid.” It is part of the terrain of approaching 60. Now, get off my lawn! Pulls out Stanley tape. I am clearly 1/2 inch onto the public easement! signed, 66 year old grumpy neighbor I noticed the following story on America becoming a post-literate society and the imminent end of civilization as this trend continues and spreads worldwide: The Dawn of the Post-Literate Society. The author blames it all on smart phones. By coincidence I am now reading Empire of Illusion by Chris Hedges, which makes the same case for America becoming post-literate, but barely mentions smart phones—because it was published in 2009, when they were still just starting to come on strong. Hedges blames cable TV and the internet. And both books quote Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, which was making many of the same arguments in 1985. The overall argument is correct, but what needs to be added is that each new technological and regulatory “advance” accelerates the damage done by previous ones. Really you can start with movies and radio in the very early 20th century as the first few pebbles in the avalanche, and television in the very late 1940s was the big boulder that cascaded the decline in literacy much more dramatically, pushing us toward a culture of visual imagery and Ong’s “secondary orality” (it’s amusing to compare TV programming and advertisements from the 1950s with anything from decades later to see how primitive and tentative the early content was, as opposed to the manipulative sophistication of later offerings). Hedges also compares literacy level required to be able to follow Presidential debate arguments, finding JFK vs. Nixon in 1960 to be two full grades lower than Lincoln-Douglas, with the Obama-Trump-Biden era dumbed down almost three full grades more—down to a 7th grade level, consistent with almost half on American adults only able to read at a 6th grade level now. Aurelien likes to blame the stupidity of our leaders and the nihilism and dumbing down of society on the New Left, postmoderns, hippies, and other Baby Boomer demons, but the cause was plainly the media environment they were enveloped in from birth, an environment which got more than just additively worse for succeeding generations each time we went to a new technology (and the associated regulatory framework for it), so, from broadcast television to cable television, from personal computers to internet connected computers to smart phones and tablets, from movies in theaters to VHS to DVD to streaming, etc. And at each step the content delivered by these media (like much social media now) has become, while technically even more glossy and sophisticated, morally and culturally more crude, more violent, more degrading, and more appealing to our worst impulses. We Boomers are children of the tube, and for all the teeth gnashing about the internet far too little is made of how television changed America. For example one reason the rich were able to take over politics was because campaigns began to center around expensive television advertising. Attack commercials became a staple of weak candidates like George W. Bush and his SC hitman Lee Atwater (met him once). Journalism too began to be more about “news personalities” rather than faceless newspaper scribes. People like Dan Rather–currently complaining about Repub threats–became millionaire celebrities with a different perspective than the old shoe leather up from the police beat crew. One doesn’t want to over simplify given all the other post WW2 changes, but here’s suggesting the sources you quote are still dead on target. As if the founding fathers were poor people? The Robber Barons never existed? The rich have always owned the levers of politics and were onlyy temporarily throttled back by the New Deal. But I never claimed that our country was once run by the poor or that pre television politics were simon pure. What I am saying is that the increasing cost of campaigns, their reliance on television and image, certain Supreme Court rulings have accelerated the class war to the point where the working class seems to have no voice at all other than the fake populism of televsion hero Trump who used his celebrity rather than his riches to win. The high cost also feeds into the Congressional incumbency racket where Congress people spend a huge amount of time sucking up to donors to pay for their campaigns. It’s a much bigger pay for play. Manifestly ignorant societies with nuclear weapons; What could go wrong? To say nothing of Public Health. Can a complex civilization built by a highly literate population be maintained when it’s inherited by a barely literate population of visual image addicts who can only the describe the world in the exaggerated “good guy”-“bad guy” stereotypes of oral heroic fantasy sagas? That’s really the question. How long can America’s Eloi keep nuclear reactors, data centers, ICBM silos, hospitals, universities, interstate highways, railroads, and wastewater treatment plants repaired and running before they have to import the Russian or Chinese Morlocks to handle all that complexity for them? It’s not only that the rich are running the system with a tighter stranglehold than before, but they’re running it into the ground with their incompetence, stupidity and hubris, all the while living in a mental dreamworld where they are fabulously brilliant, meritocratic geniuses.

My parents and I are in the French Alps this week. Yesterday, half way up Mont Blanc, it was 31 c. It’s equally warm today. Amazing. Here in Madrid it is somehow hotter but, at least, night temperatures go below 20 C these days unlike in June, July or August. Particularly, June felt hellish. Here and in Paris, when i went to visit my daughter. They are bullying everyone: Candace Owens’s comments were insightful, as they are also an indictment of the Trump / US foreign policy (and Israeli FP) and even Trump himself, though she is referencing Bill Ackerman. And that would place her “left” of the official US political “left.” If you has asked me five years ago who would be the biggest public critics of the Zionist entity, Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson would not have been anywhere near the top of my list. Yet here we are, with those other public figures who definitely know better largely silent. i might not be a regular to either (i tried to listen to Owens´s piece on Madame Macron but that as far as i came did not strike me as worth my time; perhaps wrongly so?) but on the general level – indeed, fantastic actually. And terrifyingly so on the other hand, 5 years ago I was living on the other side of the moon…it feels like a lifetime ago. My view is that “dissidents,” practically by definition, are a little nuts and are given to occasional wild and crazy musings. But, when the whole world is going crazy, it takes crazy but honest people to see and tell the truth. not wrong suggestion at all ;-) Facts, bro. Count me as one of em! Gotta do crazy shit to test the limits of our Society and find the Golden Mean 😊 You can add in Marjorie Taylor Greene as well. Crazy times. re: history of military affairs “Operational History (German) Section” – Nazis/US/RU I ran across the Operational History (German) Section which was operated by the US ARMY between 1946 and 1961. It tasked over 300 German officers and generals to deliver a military history of WWII. From THEIR POV. I haven´t looked it up yet but I assume this is closely related to Andrei Martyanov´s suggestions about US (post) Cold War views on Russia. Views that would shape the training and tactics of US and NATO forces against Russia not just 40 years ago but today too, alongside the experience of the War On Terror. Which is why I personally see it as a rather important finding. (Not to those of course who have already studied this issue closely.) I suggest everyone read it. The Wiki Page can be easily translated as there is NO Engl. version (which is more than interesting). https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_History_(German)_Section#cite_note-29 https://de-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true#cite_note-29 I ran across it studying German newspapers and the Propaganda Ministry´s SOP during WWII. Several of those men were integrated into “Operational History (German) Section”. It was headed by Franz Halder. Halder was: “(…) Chief of staff of the Army High Command in Nazi Germany from 1938 until September 1942 (…) directed the planning and implementation of Operation Barbarossa (…) became instrumental in the radicalisation of warfare on the Eastern Front. He had his staff draft both the Commissar Order (issued on 6 June 1941) and the Barbarossa decree (signed on 13 May 1941) that allowed German soldiers to execute Soviet citizens for any reason without fear of later prosecution, leading to numerous war crimes and atrocities during the campaign. After the war, he had a decisive role in the development of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. (…)”. On his and the Section´s function: “(…) As early as 1946, the former Chief of the Army General Staff, Franz Halder, justified his leading role in the Operational History Program by stating that he was contributing to “continuing the fight against Bolshevism.”[21] In 1949, Halder saw his task as Topic Leader as being, in cooperation with the Control Group, “to contribute beyond the establishment of individual facts to clarifying the internal connections of major military issues.”[22] (…)” The intent and role of the studies made should not be a critical analysis. Instead: “(…) No experiences are to be recorded, no leadership secrets are to be explained or even revealed, but rather (in the style of the Reich Archives on the First World War) facts, the course of the fighting and the events on the German side are to be described. […] The German actions are to be seen and recorded from the German point of view, and thus a memorial is to be erected to our troops. […] The achievements of our troops are to be duly appreciated and highlighted. Of course, the truth must not be disregarded in this way. (…)”[7] And this only the mundane Wiki. I the 1970’s to 1990’s people like John Erickson and later David Glantz did an enormous job to bring to Soviet experience of WW2 to the west and prove beyond any doubt that – most WW2 German military documents being archived in Moscow – the German generals basically wrote apologies, not military history. When they won it was due to their brilliance (and not having superior numbers or overwhelming air support), when they lost it was Hitler micromanaging or the Soviet hordes just overrunning them. And none of them was ever involved in the deaths of the 14 million Soviet civilians in any way or form – it just kinda happened. When Erickson died, he was in the middle of writing a new book proving that in 1945 the Red Army was better and more efficient fighting force than Wehrmacht ever had been and that the chances of survival for an individual soldier in the Red Army were better than in any other army in WW2. Sadly, it was never finished. Much appreciated! I have learned of Glantz by now regularly looking up Martyanov´s military scholarship. Erickson´s work I will look into too now. Any reading suggestions? p.s. I have muttered for a long time critique over the fact that we as a continent do not speak Russian and therefore have missed out on 100+ years of knowledge and cultural production (just the USSR angle now) which most likely will never be compensated for. Similar with the total exclusion of GDR expertise by the “victorious” FRG in so many disciplines ranging from art, literature to diplomacy to economics and climate research. Generations of knowledge wiped out. Actually, German theatre companies have just started to revive DDR operettas (Messeschlager Gisela in Cottbus, In Frisco ist der Teufel los in Berlin). I don’t know how this extends to other arts, I would assume an exception to the rule for a certain target audience. I was referring to the big context of unification and the eclipsing of almost the entire intellectual production of the GDR beyond some writers, painters, directors, scholars who mostly were already known in the FRG before 1989. Especially as latter are concerned it appears as if we are stuck with the clichés of evil Communist dictatorship. It will all fade eventually but only as part of everything else into oblivion. So GDR will remain mostly a forgotten realm of – whatever. Unless you are someone specialized. But that won´t concern 99% of the population. Case in point were short-lived discussions 25 years ago about the mistake of dismantling of the big GDR film production and the huge Babelsberg film studios. 3000 craftsmen were mostly fired or simply let go, the body of a highly-skilled workforce. One could have integrated them instead, maybe unite that studio with other Western locations – if one had had any vision of a e.g. pan-German film industry (together with Austria and Switzerland). But if addressed this (utopian way) even knowing people were just laughing. Instead East Germany lost most of its cinemas. Out of 1500 cinemas pre-1989, around 200 survived. And by comparison to other areas with film folks the “integration” or further development would have been easy. The overwhelming majority of entertainment/journalism which was considerable was mostly out of work over night. And often craftswise they were better than those in the West, e.g. singers, dancers, musicians, show hosts, critics. A very sad story, catastrophic by certain standards. Never happened… …to my surprise a lot of Erickson in the library of my choice by comparison The influence is gigantic, especially evident in the writings by and of US military historians, including many serving military officers through 1960s at least. It took people who saw real combat to rethink the conventional wisdom abd that still was not easy (I note that Col Glantz was an artilleryman in VN who had much exp trading fire with PAVN gunners and their Soviet pieces who’d have appreciated the latter’s methods before becoming a full time historian) For those as uninformed as myself this decent Wiki on Erickson (obviously from a pre-MI6-ed Wiki) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Erickson_(historian) found this, via a Feeny thing on Unherd: https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/youre-being-rude-put-away-your-phone i am impressed enough that i sent it to my youngest, up there at Texas Tech, who is most definitely addicted to his fondleslab. Gotta say, in a world bent on getting Hot Hot Hot, I had the most pleasant summer in my 20 years of living in Tiny Town from a temperature standpoint. Maybe we eked out a dozen days of 100 or more. It was as if our environment wasn’t even trying, lots of days in the lower 90’s and utterly pleasant. Interesting. In complete contrast, the summer or ’25 was the worst summer I’ve experienced in my life. 8 weeks with no rain. Temperatures (humidex adjusted) in the high 40s, wildfire smoke. Unpleasant and anxiety raising. I am wearing out my night guard from grinding my teeth in my sleep. We have had some rain but not enough. I am very worried about local farmers. This is not good. Wuk, How do you keep cool with no electricity when it is over 100? …that’s why they invented air conditioning Shockwave as Houthi drone hits hotel; Qatar attack triggers new Mideast alliance – Janta Ka Reporter, YouTube After clicking on this link, I noticed another video in the sidebar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW7L6ALWK80 Egypt & Turkey TEAM UP – The END of ISRAEL? (Note: First time I saw this channel, so I’m not familiar with the background of the speakers. I’m only posting for the subject matter discussed on this day.) While they point out that it’s a tricky situation, this and the other videos intensifies a point: The countries in the Mid-East must get past divisions and work on unity among themselves as a first step to regional security. They may then choose other big countries outside for alliances, but their unity would be the first step toward real security – or other big powers will continue to use the divisions to their own advantage. Some may do it with less blood spilled, but they are all prone to use the advantage. There is still much left to unpack with the volatile situations faced by Lebanon and Iran. 17 years ago, Gaddafi lamenting the state of Arab relations. Gaddafi Speech at Arab League Meeting, March 2008 – We all distrust each other https://youtu.be/fMLmA4lnxXo Well, maybe the people who are actually involved don’t share our notions of who they should unite with. It reminds me of the the time the Arabs invaded France in what allegedly was a death struggle between Christianity and Islam. In fact Christians and Muslims all over the place were happily making deals with each other to fight other Christians and Muslims. They might not have liked each other but they really didn’t like Charles Martel. They are making their own decisions about those using divisions for advantage. I don’t claim credit for giving them “the notion”. 🤡 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15115581/Putin-Russia-sends-sick-troops-HIV-illnesses-frontline.html Putin’s contagious Kamikazes: Russia sends sick troops with HIV and other illnesses into ‘meat grinder’ assaults amid health crisis ravaging his forces Russia is sending soldiers infected with HIV, hepatitis and other contagious diseases to the frontline as part of a desperate strategy to ‘ultimately prevail’, military analysts have warned. Soldiers sporting red armbands to denote their medical conditions have been spotted around Pokrovsk, a town in eastern Ukraine and key stronghold that has recently come under intense assault by President Vladimir Putin’s forces. Experts believe the sighting of such armbands is proof of the worsening health of Putin’s troops, with the number of HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis cases said to be soaring, The Telegraph reported. Marvel Studios might wanna turn to the Daily Mail in search of new screenwriters Daily Mail took the story from The Telegraph, which took it from “Dmytro Zhmailo, executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre (USCC), a Ukrainian think tank with close links to the military”. So, from the same people that gave us blockbusters like Ghost of Kiev, Snake Island Defenders, and Shovels of Bakhmut. LOL #Frealz Great story. What disease were all the Ukrainians with the yellow armbands suffering? This is a level of idiocy I did not think even a supermarket tabloid could reach. Tomorrow Sasquatch comes to Ukraine’s aid. What disease were all the Ukrainians with the yellow armbands suffering? Jaundice? Those red armbands probably indicate TDS. “These are better Americans than the average American. That’s my clientele.” – Ken Cuccinelli said in 2014 when he launched Virginia Self Defense Law. (From the Self Defense Insurance article) Good to know our Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security believes there are select Americans that are better than the rest of us merely by purchasing his product. From GWB’s “with us or with the terrorists” to Palin’s “Real America” the notion of “What kind of American are you?” (A line in the recent movie “Civil War”) is becoming more and more weaponized and even commodified here by The Cooch. That said, I’m actually sort of in favor of the idea gun owners should be required to have insurance but more along the lines of auto insurance. Sure, you can have your gun but if you’re a 16-25 y/o male your insurance rates are gonna be sky high. found another that will compel me to wander about the environs and ponder: https://romanticon.substack.com/p/open-country A good argument, but it seems to forget the heffalump in the room, necessary population decline. As agricultural economies of scale decline, the remaining means of production manage to be able to support fewer and fewer people. This is referred to around here as The Jackpot. Insofar as this happens, those losing out in the resource competition must resort to more and more violent methods to keep alive. This is my concept of the neo-feudalism mentioned as a possibility in the essay. One major ‘service’ the Neo-feudal “Lord” offers is protection of oneself and family from the depredations of competing Robber Barons. Under this Aegis, the suggested Romantic producer cooperatives can function. A strict division of functions is established. The division of the produced resources is a matter for internal political bargaining. Stay safe. I just stumbled on the High Priest Wurlitzer of British Establishment, Andrew Marr, blaspheming with another blasphemist, on Blightys servile status towards the Hegemon, the status that is ongoing and being enhanced by our U.K. government, in the colorectal direction. Old Andy is being less than respectful to all the TechBros, the horror! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rKYHfJLbHe4 I think it informative. There is no way in hell that any of our MSM superstars would have spoken like this about the Master and his forward troops, even a year ago. Ken Klippenstein White House Eyes Transgender “Terrorist Movement” Leaked intelligence doc warns of “trans militant cult” Oh brother, these people are delusional. I know (of) several trans people, they’re just trying to live their own lives. Militarism is not on their list. From the New Market Wizards by Schwager in the early 1990s. We got our answer. In the coin toss example you just provided, computer simulations make it possible to generate huge data samples that allow you to con-dude that the mean has no limit. But how can you definitively state that the variances of commodity price distributions are not finite? Isn’t the available data far too limited to draw such a conclusion? There are statistical problems in determining whether the variance of price change is infinite. In some ways, these difficulties are similar to the problems in ascertaining whether we’re experiencing global warming. There are suggestive indications that we are, but it is difficult to distinguish the recent rise in temperature from random variation. Getting enough data to assure that price change variance is infinite could take a century. The problem for me about all this is its application to humans in a variable environment – spanning all time and space in our history. How did DSGE models/VaR work out, generational environmental bias factored in as high powered psychology is applied via endless PR/Marketing = traditions evolve in the blink of an eye … Climate is a completely different observation which is sadly framed in the simplistic notion of temp. How many of the general population have the perception gained by understanding its not just a couple of degrees increase in C/F from the past. Its how much energy is present in the atmosphere/geology/oceans globally and how that effects everything e.g. more energy means more extremes and pace of change. Its going to be an interesting summer here in OZ. That quote does not seem to be well informed. The towering mathematical talent Beniot Mandelbrot looked at the distribution of market prices, staring with commodities data for over 100 years. He found that they were random but not Gaussian (as an a normal distribution) but were Levy stable distributions with alphas of less than 2 (Gaussian distributions have an alpha of 2, which makes them tractible). They do have infinite variances: A probability distribution, with parameters α, β, c, and m (the mode). The parameter β (-1≤β≤1) determines the skewness, with β=0 corresponding to a distribution symmetric about m. The spread of the distribution depends on the value of c. The shape of the distribution depends on α (0 < α ≤ 2), with α = 2 corresponding to the normal distribution. The case α = 1 and β=0 corresponds to the Cauchy distribution. In general, the distribution has an infinite variance. The epithet ‘stable’ is a consequence of the property that (with m=0) any linear combination of random variables having this distribution will also have the distribution (with the same values for α, β, and c). Although the characteristic function for a general Lévy stable distribution is known, there is no general formula for the corresponding probability density function. https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100102659 Mandelbrot did his work in the early 1960s. I assume the special case of the Gaussian distribution does not have infinite variance, otherwise modelers would not use it as a bad proxy for market behavior. ‘Arnaud Bertrand @RnaudBertrand Absolutely extraordinary exchange between Israel and China ?? I’ve never seen such a heated exchange come out of top-level forum in China (this is from the 12th Beijing Xiangshan Forum that started yesterday), this normally never happens. The guy speaking is Yan Xuetong, the dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, the most prestigious university in China. Speaking for Israel is a military officer apparently called Elad Shoshan.’ You can tell that that IDF guy is frustrated. If that Dean had been from any western country, then he would lose his job, be canceled and face charges of antisemitism before the end of the day. But this Dean, being from a prestigious Chinese institute, can call the IDF guy out on his bs and he cannot do anything about it. Not even Trump can sanction this guy. It really is a side show …. So the IDF guy is using the terrorist label, applied with a broad brush, too a whole indigenous ethic group, post Israel breaking every agreement/treaty since Balfour, funded Hamas via Qatar to oust the PLA, and set them up so it would vindicate liquidating the entire population so they could take it over …. without blinking an eye … Thanks for quoting my comment on the H-1B situation. Regarding the ‘annual’ thing that found its way into some of the reports, this was apparently based on statements from [Sec. of Commerce] Howard Lutnick, who said the intention was for the $100,000 fee to apply annually but ‘the details are still being worked out’. There is nothing about that in the order itself, as you can see, and I’m not sure how that would even work (H-1Bs apply for three years, and once you have one I don’t see how you shake them down for another $100k the following year absent a law change). So if the media is reporting it badly that’s partly because there’s considerable ambiguity and confusion at the source (this seems to be a feature and not a bug for Trump, as usual). Here’s an updated example: Lutnick also repeatedly said on Friday that the fee would be annual for companies, while the White House official said Saturday that it’s a “one-time fee that applies only to the petition.” In her Saturday afternoon post, Leavitt clarified that the payment would only be a “one-time fee” — not an annual one. The order supports the latter read, but it’ll come down to what replaces it in 12 months, if anything. A fascinating interview by Nima at Dialogue Works. Max Blumenthal: Charlie Kirk’s Story FALLS APART Awkward questions being raised. watching thank you Blumenthal’s first statement, 8 minutes in, resolves to the profound. blum through the red pill It’ll be very interesting to see if Kirk’s widow and new Turning Point leader is pro-Israel or closer to Kirk’s late life views. If the latter, how long she lasts. I don’t keep up on the personal lives of the punditry so unsure if she has demonstrated any prior political savviness, but pretty reliably the first line of defense on free thinking for someone public like this is the all expenses paid trip to Israel with an escorted trip to Jerusalem to ‘see the reality’*. So keep an eye out for that (or not) because Netanyahu will absolutely not miss the opportunity to parade her in front of the cameras to bolster his current ‘it wasn’t me’ claims. *: I have been subjected to a lower-profile version of this – I’m not a public figure so I didn’t get the press complement of course – there is an official tour guide trained to explain to you, the outsider, why things are the way they are there and every explanation they have comes back to ‘them against us’. My guide spent a lot of time ranting about the perfidy of Qatar after he had warmed up a bit, and this was the first time I was exposed to the ‘Qatar is behind everything’ meme over there. I was also being escorted by a Kahanist so it was like, double-barreled insanity. It is difficult to withstand this stuff unless you are already kind of used to navigating lies and bs with diplomacy (I am, it is part of my job) and practiced in critical thinking. So I don’t have high hopes for Kirk’s widow, I expect her to take the money and shut up. I’m cynical enough to think that if she might not be compliant she would not have been allowed to take the job. 2 min. clip from THE INDEPENDENT´s conversation series. I have never seen this. And I almost never watch anything like this. Former MI6 Chief ‘worried’ Trump has bias that Russia has right to Ukraine due to its size https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/constantine-dobrowolski-nazi-spy-mi6-blaise-metreweli-b2778104.html But when I do encounter this sort of demeanor and level of idiocy of self-proclaimed elites I must confess I am all in with Martyanov´s diatribes and Russia- cheerleading. This is simply sick in such a profound way. No wonder Hitler had hoped to coalesce with GB. This is the sediment of Nazism as a form of imperialism. And it has to go. No question about it. And since it has been cultivated for 500 years it´s not gonna be easy and it´s not gonna be quick. And certainly not going away without resistance. Sometimes it´s curing to see such instances of megalomania, incompetence and suprematism cast in dialect, gestures, language, tonality. Politeness and a matter-of-factness which are mind-blowing. If the other side deems you not worthy there is nothing but force to make clear to them this far and no further. Otherwise they will never stop and never yield. Sigh.

Title: Missed the gold rush? Here's why some collectors start with silver
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-some-collectors-buy-silver-as-gold-price-climbs-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-20T09:57:03Z
Full Content:
Price rallies, like the recent surge in the gold market, can inspire FOMO, the fear of missing out. This week, the price of gold topped $3,700 per ounce, roughly twice its level two years ago — and the precious metal is on track for a record year. The high unit price for gold bars and coins could have some collectors feeling priced out of the market. A one-ounce gold bar or coin, like the Golden Eagle, is now worth as much as a well-used car. But there's another precious metal that's also been on the rise recently — one that's a lot more affordable when it comes to the kind of physical forms available at Costco or a local dealer. "Gains in gold attract ancillary buying in silver, possibly by investors who have not taken full advantage of the gold rally," HSBC precious metals analyst James Steel wrote in a note last month. In percentage terms, silver's rally of 47% this year so far outpaces gold's 39%, as of midday Friday. The two-year gains for both metals are remarkably similar. "If gold keeps going up, silver, with a lag, will do the same," said Ed Yardeni, a market veteran and president of consulting firm Yardeni Research. He expects gold to reach $4,000 by the end of this year, as some other Wall Street investors have predicted. Currently at around $43 per ounce, silver's lower price per ounce has made it an entry point for some novice collectors who don't have to spend nearly as much cash to begin learning the ups and downs of owning physical precious metals. That's what one collector previously told Business Insider he did when starting out, later shifting into gold when he got more comfortable buying metals and realized how much more storage space silver requires. "I'm not going to be able to carry a suitcase full of silver around," this collector said. While silver has several similarities with gold, it also carries more risk, thanks largely to its heavy use in industrial applications that tie it more to the economy. "Silver is more volatile, typically both up and down, so it's a wilder ride," Stefan Gleason, CEO of Money Metals Exchange, a large US precious metals dealer, told Business Insider. "It's not something that you should be looking at in terms of a short-term investment because of that." While silver lacks gold's advantage as a widely accepted reserve stock, it has seen several price rallies in recent years that correlate strongly with gold, though silver tends to be delayed a bit. "Silver very much acts like a leveraged play on gold," Gleason said. "It goes up more when gold goes up, particularly in the latter half of a bull market, and it goes down more when gold goes down." Gleason sees more upside to silver, given the historically wide price ratio between gold and silver right now. Investors scrutinize that, Steel wrote. Steel's August forecast, however, did not anticipate silver prices staying above $40 per ounce for very long. That could be because some collectors are using this run of relatively high gold and silver prices to cash out, Steel found. That's increasing the supply on the market. "We're actually doing more buying of metal, back from back from our customers and from the public than we've ever done," Gleason also said. Still, as any avid collector knows and a novice will quickly learn, buying precious metals is a long play. Ownership often introduces new puzzles to solve, like where to store it, whether to insure it, and who to sell it to if the need arises. Those are lessons that can be learned as easily with silver as with gold — at a fraction of the cost. Get the latest Gold price here. Get the latest Silver price here. Jump to

Title: Rob Arnott revolutionized stock investing. Decades later, he's still disrupting the market's favorite strategies.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/rob-arnott-profile-research-affiliates-stock-market-index-investing-strategies-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-20T09:45:01Z
Full Content:
Rob Arnott had just finished his burger when we ended up on perhaps the most interesting detail of an hourlong interview: He has seen 18 solar eclipses. That's quite the résumé, considering they only happen once every year and a half. He's traveled to see them in Antarctica and Australia. He's seen one from a plane off the coast of Iceland; another he saw in Bhutan, and one while on a boat in the Black Sea. "It's the most amazing sight the sky has to offer," Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told Business Insider over lunch last week. "It's emotional, and it's hard to put your finger on why. On one level, you feel very small. Just a little speck in the universe. And on the other hand, you're very moved by the sheer beauty of it." Initially, Arnott's passion for the celestial phenomenon surprised me. Then I connected the dots. Earlier in our conversation, Arnott had briefly mentioned that his passion for math in high school had him split between a career in finance or astrophysics. Ultimately, of course, he chose the former. "I was good at math, but not extraordinary," he said. "To make a difference in astrophysics, you have to be extraordinary." What kind of career astrophysicist Rob Arnott would have had, we'll never know. But in the world of investing, we can be certain that Arnott has made his mark. Arnott has been a pioneer in index investing products, pointing out flaws in popular mainstream indexes like the S&P 500 that can hurt investors. Since these indexes are passive, cap-weighted strategies, they can have an investor unwittingly overweight one sector or theme, like technology or AI. In the early 2000s, Arnott was the first to introduce alternative index strategies to the market, launching his Fundamental Index in 2005. Firms like BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Invesco, and PIMCO have funds that use Research Affiliates' indexes. Today, Arnott is still launching new products that challenge market dynamics. His most recent focus is on the stocks that get kicked out of or added to the S&P 500 and other indexes. Last year, he put out the Research Affiliates Deletions ETF (NIXT), which is a collection of fundamentally attractive stocks that have been taken out of the S&P 500. Last week, he released the Research Affiliates Cap-Weighted US ETF (RAUS), which takes a cap-weighted approach to indexing only after undergoing a fundamentals-based selection process. Arnott sees it as an improvement on the inefficiencies of the current selection and removal process for major indexes, which can diminish returns. "One thing that I keep learning again and again and again is the resistance to change in the indexing world," he told BI. "These are ideas that should have been advanced decades ago. And why weren't they? Very simple: We're trained to think about the world from a cap-weight centric perspective, not from a company perspective, a business perspective." Arnott's lunch place of choice was the dining room at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. He ordered an iced tea along with his burger. Though Arnott hasn't lived in New York full time since 1988, he said he's been frequenting Gramercy Tavern during his regular visits to the city since it's been around. "It's iconic, it's comfort food, it's been here forever, it's got a comfortable ambiance," Arnott said of the place. "If I have business in this part of town, Gramercy Tavern's a natural go-to." Arnott, who is based in Miami, did indeed have business in lower Manhattan that day, bouncing around town to promote his new RAUS ETF. The product seeks to correct a substantial defect in popular passive index strategies, which seem to disregard the investing maxim that past performance isn't indicative of future results. Indexes often add stocks after they've seen huge outperformance, which grows their market cap enough to be considered. However, Arnott's research finds that those returns are usually not sustained. Conversely, indexes tend to kick out stocks that have suffered poor performance, which drives down their market cap. When passive investors are forced to dump those stocks, they become even more cheaply valued. Arnott's findings show that big returns usually follow. He cited the example of Dillard's Department Store, a mid-cap stock that has been taken out of and added back to the Russell 1000 index multiple times. "In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times. So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading." "How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%," he continued. "In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000." RAUS considers four factors, Arnott said: adjusted sales, adjusted cash flow, dividends plus buybacks, and book value plus intangibles. As it works out, the fund has about a 95% overlap with the S&P 500. About 5% of companies in the benchmark index don't make the cut for RAUS, as their valuation levels or other fundamental factors weaken their investment case. Palantir, CrowdStrike, and DoorDash, for example, are not in RAUS. To fill in the rest of that 5%, Arnott applies 3% of it as an extra overweight for the top 95% of holdings. The remaining 2% are about 100 attractive small-cap stocks. This framework has beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 0.69% annually since the early 1990s, Arnott said. "It's an incredibly simple idea," he said. "We're trained to think the market is pretty efficient, big market cap means big successful future for the business, and often that's true. And often it's not." Arnott may not have gone into astrophysics all those years ago, but his inclination toward science still seems to influence his approach to investing. "I think it's great fun to just ask questions," he said. "The essence of science is disagreement, and that shows up in the investing world too. Why on earth would we be the first to challenge the notion of choosing stocks for a cap-weighted index by something other than market cap?" Arnott's consensus-busting ideas usually pinpoint abnormalities in the market — out-of-whack probabilities that make for attractive risk-reward ratios. His value- and fundamental-oriented strategies aren't quite as flashy or volatile as growth areas of the market, and don't play out overnight, but the results materialize over time. Toward the end of our lunch, Arnott pulled out his phone and showed me impressive, bright-orange photos snapped while chasing eclipses. For the most recent one he saw, on a ranch in Austin, Texas, in April 2024, there was cloud cover. So instead of trying to snap pictures, he decided to record a time-lapse. In the video, people bop around in a field, eventually stopping to look up through the overcast to marvel at the darkening sky. All the while, Arnott, having everything in place well before the moment of totality, stood behind the camera and took in the excitement. "I just set a camera up," he said, "and let it do its thing."

Title: Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton’s silver tea service up for sale
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/09/20/kildare-born-antarctic-explorer-ernest-shackletons-silver-tea-service-up-for-sale/
Time Published: 2025-09-20T04:00:00Z

The personality traits associated with collectors of art and antiques have been explored recently in various periodicals, including the Journal of Antiques and Collectibles. In an article for that specialist publication, US author and collector of Chinese porcelain Shirley M Mueller suggests the personal characteristics most associated with collectors include openness to experience and conscientiousness. She links “openness to experience” to those collectors who also have a broad range of interests, a curiosity and a deep appreciation for aesthetics. Musing on the psychology of the collector makes one wonder who might purchase an Edwardian silver tea service originally gifted to Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Co Kildare-born Antarctic explorer. The three-piece set, comprising a teapot, sugar bowl and milk jug, is for sale at Roseberys’ silver auction in London on September 30th, with an estimate of £2,000-£3,000 (€2,310-€3,470). Georgina Agnew, head of silver at Roseberrys, explains that the tea set was reputedly presented to Shackleton in New York in 1910 during his North American lecture tour. “It is engraved with the Shackleton family crest and motto ‘fortitudine vincimus’ meaning through endurance, we conquer,” she explains. The James Dixon & Sons of Sheffield tea set was passed to Ernest and Emily Shackleton’s daughter Cecily, before being given to her cousin and close friend, Rena Dodds. Dodds subsequently gifted the tea service to the current vendor’s mother. From 2001 until earlier this year, the tea set was on long-term loan to the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. But, who will buy it now? [ Listen: Ernest Shackleton’s adventure is told in his own voice - thanks to AIOpens in new window ] “As with all historically significant objects, we alert relevant museums, institutions and individuals ahead of the auction. Ernest Shackleton’s story is a global phenomenon, and while it could find a home anywhere in the world, it would be wonderful if an Irish institution were to acquire this important piece of history, given his Irish heritage,” Agnew says. Efforts by this columnist to contact the Shackleton Experience Museum in Athy, Co Kildare, were unsuccessful. A fascination for the belongings of owners of castles and stately homes will always attract potential buyers to auctions. So, Aidan Foley’s auction next week of almost 1,000 items from Castle Matrix, the former home of retired US air force pilot Colonel John O’Driscoll should draw some interest. O’Driscoll was aide to General Douglas MacArthur when he accepted the Japanese surrender in 1945. On his retirement in 1961, O’Driscoll bought and restored the dilapidated manor house near Rathkeale, Co Limerick. Originally built in the 15th century as a tower house for the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Desmond, Castle Matrix was later converted to a manor house by the Southwell family. It had been owned by the Johnstone family before O’Driscoll purchased it and opened it up for medieval-style banquets in the 1970s. Castle Matrix also served as headquarters of the International Institute of Military History and the Heraldry Society of Ireland. It remained open for tours until O’Driscoll’s death in 1991. As well as a large collection of historic books, there are more than 50 antique guns from Castle Matrix in the Foley auction. These guns, which the Garda took into storage at Collins Barracks in Cork following O’Driscoll’s death, are being sold in association with Pat Hayes, a registered firearms dealer, who must ensure any purchaser has acquired a gun licence before collecting their purchase. “It has been a difficult process to get the guns to auction, but they will be made available by Pat Hayes for viewing in Doneraile,” says Aidan Foley. Viewing for all lots continues today, tomorrow and Monday in Aidan Foley’s auction rooms in Doneraile, Co Cork. Restorers of historic houses may be interested in viewing the six 18th and 19th century fireplaces, alongside fenders and fire surrounds, at Hegarty’s live online auction on Wednesday, September 24th from 11am. The fireplaces, which include an Italian marble mantel with painted tiles and an embossed Adams-style motif from the Metropole Hotel in Cork (€6,000-€8,000), originated in Noble Antiques, a renowned specialist in antique fireplaces in Cork city, which is now closing down. An early 18th century simple framed Queen Anne-style marble fireplace is another item of potential interest (€5,000-€7,000). Finally, amid jewellery, gold and silver coins and silver bullion at Matthews’ live online auction on Tuesday, September 23rd from 5.30pm, are some quirky silver pieces. Perfect for gifts, these include a silver mustard pot with a blue glass lining (€30-€50); a silver-cased aide-memoire notebook pendant (€40-€70); and a silver pen rest with an intricate filigree domed lid (€150-€250).

More Info Back in 2021, Texas passed two laws that restricted the state from doing business with companies deemed hostile to the fossil fuels and firearm industries. The Lone Star State barred pensions and other state entities from investing in approximately 350 funds that promote environmental, social and governance, aka ESG investing, claiming that ESG investing does not act in the best financial interests of their clients. To wit, the Republican-leaning state banned Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc., Barclays Plc and members of Net Zero Banking Alliance, saying ESG is “…just a hate factory.” The anti-ESG movement has since gained traction, mostly targeting financial services like banks, pension funds and asset managers, as well as the energy sector. And now a new report by GlobalData reveals how the U.S. has become the epicenter of a rising tide of anti-ESG sentiment across the globe. The report points to a Pleiades Strategy tracker that reveals that a total of 370 anti-ESG bills were submitted to the legislatures of 40 U.S. states between 2021 and 2024. GlobalData notes that, whereas few of those bills were signed into law, this does not signify that the anti-ESG movement has weakened. Indeed, an analysis by Ropes & Gray found that anti-ESG bills filed in 2024 enjoyed a significantly higher rate of success than those filed in prior years, indicating that the architects of these bills are becoming more effective at drafting legislative challenges. Not surprisingly, the anti-ESG movement has gained massive momentum since the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President. Trump has rolled back many climate action policies by the previous administration, taken aim at DEI policies and passed executive orders banning ESG investing. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) has rolled back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027, from January 1, 2033, as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Trump’s anti-climate actions are similar to his stance in his first term when he unraveled more than 100 climate policies. There are estimates that nearly $28 billion-worth of wind, solar, EV and battery projects have been delayed or cancelled since Trump took office, with a potential 19,000 jobs chopped. “Since President Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the efforts of the anti-ESG movement have ratcheted up, and all companies (not just those in the financial services industry) lie within the movement’s scope,” the GlobalData report states. “Trump has unravelled much of the previous administration’s climate action policies, passed executive orders banning ESG investing and taken aim at DEI policies.” Meanwhile, efforts by the European Union to simplify its regulatory landscape have frequently seen the bloc slide towards anti-ESG, with growing right-wing populism bolstering climate skepticism across the globe. International markets have opposed advancing ESG standards through initiatives like the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and European Green Deal that enforce sustainability criteria by requiring disclosure of ESG-related risks. GlobalData has predicted that the anti-ESG movement will ultimately impact companies across all industries, including institutions and other entities previously considered to be fully independent. Not surprisingly, Big Oil companies have been scaling back their clean energy investments. Last year, oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced that it will not move forward with one of the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen projects if the federal government failed to provide tax incentives for natural gas-fed facilities. Current guidelines provide incentives for projects that produce "green" hydrogen by using water and renewable energy, but Exxon wants them extended to"blue" hydrogen from gas by trapping carbon emissions. That’s an interesting take because Exxon CEO Darren Woods previously expressed his doubts about the efficacy of carbon capture at lowering emissions because “…the technology works for high concentration streams of gases but is too expensive for low concentration streams.” BP Inc. (NYSE:BP) has unveiled a less aggressive decarbonization strategy that entails (1) a slower decline in upstream investments and scrapped former plans to shrink refining; (2) focus more on higher-margin hydrogen and biofuels as well as offshore wind; and (3) higher spending in both oil and gas as well as low-carbon. According to the company, the new strategy will offer higher shareholder returns, especially critical to the company after it severed ties with Russia’s Rosneft. BP’s nearly 20% stake in Rosneft helped to add several billion dollars to its bottom line every year. Back in April, BP announced that it was abandoning its hydrogen ambitions in favor of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport. Then in July, the European oil major announced that it would exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia. BP has informed its Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) partners that it will leave its role as the project’s operator and equity holder. Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) has revealed it had scrapped plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant in Norway citing lack of demand. Days later, Norway’s NOC Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) announced similar plans, "We haven't seen the market for blue hydrogen materialize and decided not to progress the project," a Shell spokesperson told Reuters.

Title: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Novo Nordisk A/S Investors of the Pending Class Action Lawsuit with a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 – NVO

September 19, 2025 16:44 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168147&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

September 19, 2025 13:18 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: As sure as Night ’n Day: Family-run business that rose from a corner dairy to 54 franchise stores – can it disrupt supermarket duopoly?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Night ’n Day general manager Matt Lane and one of the company's newest franchise stores - in Kawarau, near Queenstown. Composite photo / Oliver Rusden They hit headlines recently by selling 20,000 blocks of cut-price butter. Shayne Currie charts the rise of Night ’n Day, a family-owned business with a franchise network of more than 50 stores. Does New Zealand’s third-biggest grocery retailer hold a key to breaking the supermarket duopoly? Bridget Stevens started working in the shop as a teenager, serving at the counter every second weekend. At 15, she left school for a fulltime job in the store. By the time she was 34, she owned it. Now, another 17 years later, Stevens – along with her sister, Rebecca Excell – runs one of the most renowned Night ’n Day stores in the country. In Winton, Southland, the pair have 25 staff and a steady stream of customers: the locals who they know on a first-name basis, the truckies lining up at 6am for coffee and hot food and the State Highway 6 travellers popping in for a road-trip snack before heading north to Queenstown or south to Invercargill. “It was just a little corner dairy when I started,” Stevens says. “Olly Olsson was the owner, Mum worked here as well. When I turned 15, Mum left and they offered me her fulltime job – I left school and came here.” Then, 17-and-a-half years ago, Olsson sold up. He’d been at Night ’n Day’s annual conference and returned home to Winton, informing Stevens that he was offering her the business first. “I couldn’t stop crying. He was like, ‘Right, go and talk to your parents about it’. I went and got advice from Mum and Dad, and they were like, ‘That’s a no-brainer’.” In 2017, Excell bought into the business – she is now a 40% shareholder in the franchise. Together, the pair make a formidable team – the store has now won five store-of-the-year awards, including their most recent just last week. They say they complement each other well – Stevens with her knowledge and history; Excell, who trained at one point to be a teacher but never made it to the classroom, with her administrative skills. They both have a natural rapport with their staff. “Before Dad passed away, he was the referee,” Excell laughs, when asked if there have ever been any sisterly squabbles. “He used to come in and sort us out.” Mum still keeps an eye on the shop as well. “She’s very proud,” Stevens says. Family connections and community links run deep at Night ’n Day. Among many examples, there’s father-and-son combination Alan and Hamish Garrick, who own four Night ’n Day stores in Queenstown and Arrowtown, and husband-and-wife Sukhwinder Singh and Manjit Kaur, who own the Mt Maunganui and Rotorua stores. At the top of the business is general manager Matt Lane, who was born in 1990, the same year that his parents, Andrew and Denise – the original Night ’n Day founders – turned their fledgling group of stores into a franchise chain. The Lane family has owned Night ’n Day’s original Regent Rd store in Dunedin since 1984, buying an ageing grocer’s shop with a decaying floor and transforming it, eventually, into a 24-hour student mecca, selling all manner of hangover-curtailing staples (a hot steak pie and Coca Cola, anyone?). The Regent Rd store remains world-famous in Dunedin, but 35 years on from its launch as a franchise business, Night ’n Day has expanded well beyond its Otago roots, now operating 54 stores across New Zealand. It is the country’s third-biggest retail grocery chain. At the same time, the company is pushing for a more level playing field to take on the supermarket duopoly of Foodstuffs – which runs New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square – and Woolworths NZ (previously Progressive), the owner of Woolworths and Fresh Choice/Super Value. Last month, Night ’n Day rolled back the price of butter to August 2024 prices. Rather than a 500g block of yellow gold selling for around $11, Night ‘n Day sold 20,000 blocks – they were limited to one per customer – for $6.50 each. An effective marketing campaign and publicity stunt, it certainly forced home a point about the hefty price of butter, with the duopoly in the spotlight, and broader consumer speculation of a major new competitor. “I think too much focus is on a third player,” Matt Lane told Karen O’Leary of the Paddy Gower Has Issues TV show. “How can we change the market to be a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth? Let’s not limit ourselves. Are the small centres going to end up with Costco’s? Absolutely not. “Is Timaru, is Greymouth? They’re not going to end up with a Costco, so why should [those towns] be disadvantaged purely because we’re trying to get an international player that competes in the major cities to try and compress prices?” Lane tells the Herald that the duopoly situation has been a long-term problem since the early 2000s and, therefore, needs long-term solutions. He’s a big fan of the Government effectively carpet-bombing the problem with solutions, rather than a piecemeal approach. “I feel – and it’s easy for me to say this – that there needs to be an overcorrection and then wind it back if necessary, rather than just trying to take one step, then one step, and then one step, and saying, ‘Is it actually working?’” The Government, the Commerce Commission and “the whole of New Zealand know it’s an issue”, Lane says. “We seem to be content just to say, ‘We’ll try and tweak wholesale, or create a wholesale supplier. We’ll try and tweak some of the competition rules or the land covenants’. “Let’s try to fix everything. If we find that something is a bit harsh, you can still dial it back again to find that parity, but we’re a long way away from creating competition.” Night ’n Day was once a member of the Foodstuffs co-operative, giving it access to wholesale prices of dry grocery items. That came to a halt in 2011 - Foodstuffs has previously cited breaches of its membership agreement; the decision also coincided with Night ’n Day partnering up with Gull to open 21 new stores in the North Island. The grocery challenges have meant some Night ’n Day stores lost the ability to hold liquor licences. Because grocery wholesale prices jumped and therefore the retail price lifted, they weren’t selling enough relevant products to be deemed a grocery retailer (and therefore able to also sell booze). Despite these hurdles, Night ‘n Day is a big business success story, largely because of its agility and a necessary pivot away from a focus on groceries – they’re still there, but currently more expensive because of the wholesale issues – to a more purposeful, competitive offering within three distinct pillars: coffee, milk bar and fresh food-to-go/deli foods. “That’s because everyone can access different prices and you can create a differentiation of the product,” Lane says. “That’s where we see a massive amount of growth and that allowed us to sustain our operations because we lost all the profitability and sales of grocery.” While serving barista coffee and hot food might seem common sense, New Zealand has a reputation for leading these retail trends internationally. Lane recalls being at a US retail conference when an expert speaker’s suggestion of barista coffee – rather than the instant, filter variety – was met with gasps and concern in the American audience. New Zealand had been selling it for years. Night ’n Day has also been turbocharged in recent years with delivery service in the form of Uber Eats, Door Dash and Deliver Easy. “It’s the next step of convenience,” Lane says. “Historically, we’re a convenience store because you can get in and out very quickly based on the format size.” Now, convenience arrives at your front door. “People are living a lot more here and now. They’re living for the moment. They value their time a lot more.” While Night ’n Day has a network of 54 stores dotted from Southland to Whangārei and is always looking to grow, Lane says there is no magical number. “It’s the quality over quantity for us. We look at every opportunity as it comes across. We certainly don’t sit there ... being complacent with what we’ve got. “We do want to grow, but we want to make sure that it works, first of all, for the brand, franchisees and the site itself.” Lane reveals the company is looking at several potential new sites, including one at Jack’s Point, in Queenstown, as well as exploring some further options in Dunedin. There is also a “clear gap” in Hamilton. “It just feels like that’s a logical city we’re not part of, when you look at our geographical spread.” An indication of a franchise value is revealed on Night ’n Day’s own website. Right now, two franchises are listed for sale - Cromwell, for $680,000 plus stock at valuation (an estimated $160,000), and Dee St in Invercargill, for $450,000 plus stock at valuation (estimated at $125,000). According to the website, the Cromwell store has a weekly turnover of $62,700 and Dee St has a weekly turnover of $51,000. The average gross profit for each site is 34%. Lane talks of Night ’n Day having more agility than similar-sized retail convenience brands. “We can’t compete on [a marketing] budget with the BPs and the Zs in terms of doing things that way. We’ve just got to do it by creating a point of difference and we do that through our supplier base, speed to market, the ability to have an idea in the morning and execute it in the afternoon.” Like Bridget Stevens in Winton, Matt Lane first experienced life in the shop as a young teenager, stacking shelves. That later became a university job behind the counter, alongside a number of his mates. After graduating from Otago University and working for four years at Deloitte, he came back into the business in 2016, working in business development and then finance before becoming general manager in 2019. Lane’s mother, Denise Lane, says she and her husband, Andrew, owned two standalone dairies in Dunedin initially. They sold those in 1984 to buy the Regent Rd store in the heart of the student district. It was a good-performing store and long-established on a busy street. The site also became the family home for the Lanes and their young children, with their residence attached. Staff had to use the family toilet. “Our hallway wasn’t a normal hallway – it was all filled with shelves and stock because our house was also our storage room.” Opposite them was a BP station, and the Lanes started hearing whispers that it would start trading 24 hours a day. They acted quickly and got in first. They knew they needed to retain their regular customers – a 24-hour rival threatened to draw them away. While Night ’n Day went 24 hours, the BP never did. It’s no longer there. “It was the first standalone 24-hour convenience store in New Zealand,” Andrew Lane says. “There was nothing like it. It started off slow, but it actually picked up and we thought, ‘we’re on a winner here’.” Confident that the model could work elsewhere, the couple then sought out and bought the best dairies in Invercargill and Christchurch. In 1990, the couple were at a National Association of Retail Grocers of New Zealand (Nargon) conference where they met representatives from the Night Owl convenience chain from Australia. “At that stage, we had five stores and they had 10 or 11, and they explained to us about franchising, which we’d never heard of as a business system back then. We’d probably heard of the McDonald’s way of doing things, but didn’t really know too much about it,” Andrew Lane says. “They explained what they had gone through – they said you should really look at it, it’ll move you away from the day-to-day hassles of operating a convenience store, and you’ll be able to help other people replicate what you’ve done. “We did some investigation into franchising and we thought, well, yeah, this system works and it works well. And we said, if we’re going to do that, then we’ve got to come up with a brand.” With the help and expertise of a Dunedin graphics designer, they came up with the Night ’n Day concept and worked over the following months to develop systems, including operations manuals. The other dairies were rebranded. Andrew Lane was worried about that, but he says there was no pushback. “There was none at all; it was all in our head!” Denise Lane puts a myth to bed that the blue-and-gold colours were a nod to their Otago heritage. Not at all, she says – they represent night and day. Matt Lane says there is no one “silver bullet” to compete against the supermarkets. “We need the foundations to be able to compete, whether it’s ourselves, whether it’s The Warehouse, whether it’s a new player coming in. More competition in this space helps us, even if we’re not the leader in it. “Do we want to grow? Yes, absolutely. The only way I can see it happening, though, is through the existing set-ups. “It’s very hard for any player to sit there and go, I’m going to open opposite a Pak’nSave and compete. It’s just not going to happen. There’s not the brand presence. There’s not the pockets to be able to do so. “We’ve grown organically over time. We’ve utilised the conversion of some Four Square stores to be able to do that. “To start creating competition, I think one of the most important things is removing the restraints of trade on the duopoly stores. If someone is currently operating a Four Square and they want to convert or go independent, there should be no barriers for them to do so.” Lane points out there’s not a lack of brands in New Zealand, it’s a commonality of ownership. “If you had Pak’nSave, Fresh Choice, New World, Woolworths and Four Square all competing against each other, it would actually be quite a competitive marketplace and they’d all try and take each other’s market share. “Whereas what we’ve got is quite a complacent duopoly where everyone just plays in their own space ... ” Lane also points out that for every day that the status quo remains, the duopoly grows stronger. “They’re opening new stores, they’re creating a better footprint, they’re cementing brand awareness. “Competitors are getting more and more nervous. It’s one thing to come out and go, we’re going to fix the supermarket industry – that happened in 2021. We’re now in 2025. “My discussion to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] was there’s been nothing given to me that has improved my business and my ability to compete that wasn’t available to me in 2021. So we’re four years deep and I don’t have one tangible thing I can point to say, ‘This is helping me grow and succeed’. “But then you go, ‘Who is going to take the risk and why would they take the risk in the New Zealand market?’ Bit different in the States or Australia, given the population size and density. “But there needs to be a genuine motivation or genuine support to actually be able to encourage people to do that.” After first interviewing Lane in early August, I went back to him this week for an update. “No public announcement has benefited us to increasing competition, however what is encouraging is the key components that will improve competition are still being worked though and considered. “It is a wait-and-see, but there is still a lot of resource being allocated to increasing competition and I’m hopeful something will eventuate.” For all their success, Andrew and Denise Lane remain remarkably grounded – they are thrilled to see new generations of families in their franchise stores coming through the business. “I don’t know if I see it as a major success story,” Andrew Lane says. “I probably see it more as something that we just wanted to achieve and just kept on achieving it to grow.” He says when the business entered its franchising structure in 1990, it was with the intention of mentoring and “helping other people enjoy a business that we both thoroughly enjoyed, and to grow like that”. Denise Lane adds: “It was a case of long, hard hours. I guess we never thought it was going to get to where we are now. “It was like a Ferris wheel – when you got on the ride, you couldn’t get off it until it stopped. It has not stopped yet.” Disclaimer: Night ’n Day recently sponsored the NZ Herald’s Great NZ Road Trip project. This article is an independent editorial story.

Shares of Netskope (NTSK) surged Friday, extending gains after making their debut on the Nasdaq Thursday. The stock was up close to 7% around $24 in recent trading, after finishing Thursday's session 18% above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $19 per share. The IPO price was at the high end of the company’s expectations, and the 47.8 million shares sold helped Netskope raise $908.2 million. CEO Sanjay Beri told Yahoo! Finance in a televised interview that he expects going public could help boost the company's credibility and customer awareness. Netskope, which counts companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Zscaler (ZS) as competitors, reported a 31% year-over-year jump in revenue to $328 million for the six months ended in July, according to a regulatory filing. It's $170 million net loss over that period narrowed from $207 million a year ago. This has been a strong year so far for a number of cybersecurity stocks, amid expectations the sector could get a boost from strong demand trends as AI-driven threats grow. Zscaler shares have added over 60% of their value in 2025, while CrowdStrike (CRWD) has climbed close to 50%. Palo Alto Networks shares have added about 13%, roughly in line with the S&P 500's rise over the same period.

Paschal Sheehy Southern Editor More than 100 venues across Cork will open tonight as part of Culture Night events in the city. They will include music and dance, literature and visual arts. Many of the events are concentrated in the city centre, with activities also in Blackpool, Togher, Churchfield and Mayfield. Online, Cork International Film Festival will present a selection of short films. Events are presented by Cork City Council in collaboration with the Arts Council. Some events require pre-booking, and details of all events taking place in the city are available at the Cork City Council website. Cian Sweeney presents 'As If I Always Knew: A Piano Meditation' in the Cork City Hall's concert hall; a variety of choirs will entertain on the City Hall plaza; a multi-panel art piece from Mahon Community Arts Project will be on display in the atrium; and the Millennium Hall will see a fun show called 'Squish, Stomp, Spin - The Magic of Stim', by performance artist and neurodiversity activist, Moss Russell. "It's my favourite night of the year," Moss Russell told RTÉ News as she looked ahead to Culture Night. "I love being part of it, I love performing in it, but I really miss running around and watching all the amazing things that are happening - just hopping from place to place, getting all of this free culture. It's absolutely one of the best nights of the year." Rappers and musicians from the Kabin Krew studio will celebrate the release of their new album, 'Up The Kabin', when they deliver a pop-up performance on Corn Market Street at 8pm. Kabin Krew Rapper Aaron Hennessy -- who earlier this year recorded with RTÉ's Bryan Dobson - is a big fan of Culture Night. "It's brilliant, yeah," Aaron said. "We've loads of opportunities and loads of decent stuff going on tonight." Cork City Library will host exhibitions, live music, theatre, readings, children's storytelling and creative workshops. Among the highlights will be the Rory Gallagher-inspired 'Kickback City' exhibition, an adaptation Coleridge’s 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' and music from Áine O’Gorman. There will be Irish language activities, in association with An t-Oireachtas, including award-winning sean-nós singer Sorcha de Róiste who will present a unique workshop celebrating traditional Irish song and 'Amhráin na Mara' (Songs of the Sea), a celebration of maritime songs in both Irish and English. MTU buildings across the city will open their doors too. Centre piece will be a multi-venue exhibition of works by MTU Crawford College of Art and Design alumni, in the James Barry Exhibition Centre in Bishopstown and also at Grand Parade. There will be talks at Blackrock Castle Observatory and a night of music and theatre at the Cork School of Music. At UCC, there will be conversation and music "as gaeilge" in Áras Uí Rathaille, trad music in the Hub, a Chinese cultural experience in the Boole Library, and a walking tour of UCC’s LGBT+ history at the iconic Clock Tower. Visitors can also enjoy live music at the Department of Music, theatre workshops at the Granary Theatre, and a literature evening in the Boole library, while Visitor Services will host children’s story time and guided walks.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield—which measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period—for the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity—so-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares—could benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.

Title: This Week in Games - Nintendo September Direct 2025
URL: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-games/2025-09-19/nintendo-september-direct-2025/.228798

Welcome back, folks! I hope everyone enjoyed my cameo appearance in This Week in Anime yesterday. I'd have made a cute segue for it in last week's column, but things were arranged a bit too late for that. It's always nice to collaborate with Steve, Coop, and Chris, especially when I can chat about topics I'm familiar with. I got to meet Chris in person for the first time a few weeks back; he's just as charming as his writing. We were also able to meet up with fellow This Week in Anime alums Nicky. Good times were had by all! Today, though, we're covering a ton of news—so let's begin. People sure love tempting the Persona 5 curse. You'd think after Star Ocean: anamnesis, Dragalia Lost and the Fullmetal Alchemist gacha, folks would have a bit of trepidation about collaborating with Persona 5. Oh well! Here comes Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has had a lot of collaborations with Japanese media lately, and they've been hit-or-miss. The One-Punch Man outfits didn't look great, and the Cowboy Bebop collab was all right (given some weird faces). This time, the suits look pretty good. Mercy as Panther/Ana actually looks pretty great, and I can't fault any of the other choices (D.Va as Queen/Makoto, Genji as Skull/Ryuji, Wuyang as Joker/Akira, and Lifeweaver as Fox/Yusuke). They've even got art from Shigenori Soejima; that's at least as much effort Fortnite would put into one of these. The collab started on September 16; at the time of writing, further details haven't been released. I snark, but the skins look legitimately cool. I might be a bit burnt out at the sight of Persona 5, and Overwatch has never really done anything for me. But kudos to Blizzard for finally getting one of these right. A major surprise dropped into our laps earlier this week with the reveal of two new Game Boy Advance titles added to Nintendo's NSO+ service—and both of them are third-party titles from Bandai Namco! While they were exclusives to Nintendo's old handheld, this opens a lot of fun doors for the NSO+ library. Provided, we might want to keep those reins in check: these likely came about because Nintendo and Bandai Namco have some very close business relations. Those old side-scrollers starring Nickelodeon characters might still be a bridge too far, more's the pity. First up is Mr. Driller, Bandai Namco's long-running puzzle series starring the eponymous miner. The Mr. Driller games are fun, hectic puzzlers: using your drill, you tunnel your way through variously-colored minerals, with entire blocks of like-colored minerals vanishing at once. But as you drill your way through, blocks that aren't affixed to larger blocks will fall behind you, forcing you to keep on digging to keep from getting caught in the cave-in. Complicating things is your oxygen meter: you lose air as you drill, and harder minerals require more effort (and thus more air), forcing you to be careful in choosing your path as you tunnel. It can be a long way between spare air tanks... Mr. Driller has never been a massive hit for Bandai Namco, but the games are fun—especially if you can take them on the go. Also fun is the lore behind the title: canonically, the titular Mr. Driller, Susumu Hori, is the son of Dig-Dug's hero, Taizo Hori. Taizo has even made cameo appearances in other Mr. Driller games! (The mom is Toby Masuyo, protagonist of Baraduke/Alien Sector. According to Namco x Capcom, Toby and Taizo had an acrimonious divorce.) The other game is another attention-nabber: Bandai Namco's beloved Klonoa: Empire of Dreams! I have a soft spot for the Klonoa titles: deceptively deep platformers with stunning presentation and music, and stories that rip your heart out. Empire of Dreams sees the Dream Traveler Klonoa having to clear his name of the crime of "dreaming of adventure." Of course, there's a reason why dreams have been outlawed, and Klonoa is likely to make us shed a few tears as he finds out the truth... Empire of Dreams continues the series' traditional mechanics: Klonoa can jump and flutter around a bit by flapping his cute, floppy ears. Klonoa also has his Wind Ring, which lets him inflate enemies. From there, Klonoa can carry them around, throw them at other enemies, or throw them after jumping to extend his jump. It's basic stuff on paper, but eventually expanded into surprisingly complicated platforming sections. The Klonoa titles might be cute, but 100% completion is a true challenge in those titles. My heart always weeps for Klonoa. We were fortunate enough a few years ago to get the Phantasy Reverie Series back in 2022, and I was luckier still to get to review it. Bandai Namco even teased a possible Klonoa 3 if the collection sold well enough... but it's been three years. At the very least, the Phantasy Reverie Series regularly goes on sale for very cheap; at around $10, these are some of the best platformers you can get your hands on. I'd at least like to hope that Empire of Dreams coming to NSO+ means that the other GBA Klonoa titles are on the table. Dream Champ Tournament is also cute, but Legendary Star Medal never came to the United States. We can only hope for more chances to hear Klonoa's adorable "WA-HOO!" Both of these titles go live on NSO+ this September 25. Last week, I mentioned how Nintendo and Pokémon have become a serious "bitch eating crackers" for the gaming industry and for self-described "Gamers." For folks unfamiliar with the phrase, a "bitch eating crackers" is when you have such dislike for someone that something as innocuous as them eating crackers at the other side of the room ticks you off. I maintain that. Mind you: More than a few decisions in the following Direct did turn me off... but also, I wasn't catastrophizing about this being the worst display of arrogance from a company that "needs to be humbled." Because there wasn't any need to. I worry if I'm the crazy one, but then I read past the headline of an article... With 2025 being the 40th anniversary of the Mario Brothers, Nintendo has arranged for several fun goodies: special art and light displays at the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, sponsoring the annual Kyoto Marathon... fun stuff. There was also the news that the Mario Bros. sequel is being developed, and it's going with Super Mario Galaxy. (A lot of folks have pointed out that Old Spice jumped the gun a little and spoiled the reveal with some of their promotional stock that is in stores now. Whoops.) Weird that the movie is going with Galaxy, but considering that none of the other Mario games escalate on the level Galaxy does, I see where they're coming from. Doki Doki Panic has been buried; Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World only really introduce the Koopalings, which aren't enough of a draw; Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine don't really shake up the formula enough, and Illumination still thinks Chris Pratt is more charming than Charlie Day, so that's a no-go on Luigi's Mansion. No word yet on who's playing Princess Rosalina, but Rosalina's storybook (as in, an actual physical representation of it) is for sale on Nintendo's website and set to release this November 25. The real disappointment was the news that Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel are getting a remastered physical release—at full price, US$70. This is following the Super Mario Bros 3D All-Stars, which already included the first Super Mario Galaxy. Let me be clear, I think people have lost their damn minds when it comes to game price discourse. I saw someone comment that Digimon Story: Time Stranger "doesn't look AAA, so it shouldn't be priced like a AAA game," which is a great way of completely disregarding the amount of effort that went into actually producing the game. It is my genuine belief that Steam's firehouse sales have destroyed any semblance of value when it comes to a game; why buy a game at full price when you can get it for 20% off at the Summer Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for 30% off at the Winter Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for $5 at the next Spring Sale? I feel like the effort put into remaking a game top-to-bottom isn't invalidated just because the game was originally released on Game Boy or because you can't see the individual scales on Gomamon's Marching Fishes. That said, US$70 for both Super Mario Galaxy games is where I draw the line. Both of those titles were US$20 on the Wii U! We already had Super Mario Galaxy in the first 3D collection! This is what a piss-take looks like, if you ask me. But this got weirdly ignored following the further news. At any rate, it releases on October 2, with promotional Amiibo (Mario with a Luma, and Rosalina reading a book to several Luma) releasing on April 2. I rather like the Rosalina Luma a lot. I'd rather buy that than the US$70 two-pack. I regret to inform you all that the following news involves tennis. (Cue the clip of Rex Mohs screaming his soul out in disgust.) We're getting a new Mario Tennis game, titled Mario Tennis Fever. The titular gimmick is the fever rackets: tennis rackets that can build up energy over the course of a rally to activate special effects. There are over 30 Fever Rackets, with all sorts of effects like freezing the opponent's side of the court or summoning Mini Mushrooms. There is also a record-breaking amount of characters in Mario Tennis, over 30. There are also a variety of modes, like the standard Tournament mode and online Ranked modes, along with a mode for motion controls or randomized effects on the court ("Mix-It-Up" mode). The Adventure Mode is most intriguing. It's a story mode where the Mario characters are turned into babies and have to relearn tennis skills as they travel through a world. It's a good way to mask a tutorial mode, especially for people who aren't great at tennis simulators. Mario Tennis Fever releases on February 12, 2026, but, y'know, it's tennis without Ultra-Smashes. Super Mario Wonder is also getting a dedicated port on Nintendo Switch 2—but it's not just a graphical update. New features and content were teased, but we won't hear about that until later. The main feature the Direct focused on was the Bellabel Park update, which adds a variety of multiplayer options. A lot of these are actually quite fun as party games. Also, like, if we're getting toys of Nintendo characters, can we get more Yoshi toys? There's so much money left on the table from Nintendo not making a full stable of Yoshi toys. Speaking of the T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas: A thing I appreciate about the Yoshi games is their use of different aesthetics. The original Yoshi's Island was ostensibly a Super Mario World sequel—but it abandoned the look of the original game in favor of a crayonesque design, along with its own unique platforming mechanics (i.e., carrying Baby Mario around). Yoshi's Story wasn't great, but its pop-up book aesthetic still looks pretty good. And so on with other games like Yoshi's Woolly World. So Nintendo's going all-in with Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. With the help of the encyclopedia, Mister E (get it?), Yoshi and his friends must fill out the missing pages. The whole thing is done as a side-scrolling puzzle game, figuring out the various abilities of the creatures Yoshi encounters while using the world around him to move around. The trailer showcased a puzzle where Yoshi had to spread dandelion seeds to erode a boulder that was in his way; that's some good lateral thinking. They'll have a real winner on their hands if they can properly iterate on that kind of stage construction. Also, I like the in-universe aesthetic. It's a bit Super Mario Wonder in its approach, but with undercranked character animations to sell the "illustrated" aesthetic. See, this is the thing I like seeing from Nintendo; it's disappointing that this kind of attention to detail doesn't get its due appreciation. That's not Bill Trinen! Nintendo had a minor once-over for Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream, going over the basics of character creation and care. But there wasn't much else, outside of the confirmation of a Spring 2026 release. The burning question on everyone's mind is whether Living The Dream will actually incorporate gay/lesbian couples. There was a kerfuffle over the original Tomodachi Life on 3DS, since this was impossible then (outside of a glitch). Games have come a long way in the years since, and even other Nintendo games have allowed for more gender-affirming options, such as referring to body types as "styles." And that's before you consider other titles like the Story of Seasons games, allowing for non-gender-locked relationships. It'll be a significant disappointment if Nintendo doesn't follow along. Here's a funny one. Square Enix originally broke away from Nintendo during development of Final Fantasy VII because Nintendo decided upon a cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, and Square Enix (then Squaresoft) had bigger goals in mind for their upcoming title. This was a particularly strong bit for them, so much so that they referenced the matter in their magazine ads. We wouldn't see new Final Fantasy titles on Nintendo consoles for years after that. Anyway, Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is coming to the Nintendo Switch this January 22. The first part of Square's ambitious three-part remake of the original Final Fantasy VII, the "Integrade" update includes new story beats and stages that center around Yuffie, explaining what she was doing before Cloud and company find her in the forest. There might be some graphical compromises, but I feel like those are small potatoes compared to being able to play a game of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade's scope on the go. Speaking of Amiibo! Nintendo has decided to introduce a Smash Bros-style mechanic to Kirby Air Riders wherein you can train Amiibo Figure characters. These characters will learn racing techniques as they play against you, up to and including developing a "personality" based around their experiences racing. So far, we only have Kirby on the Warp Star and Bandana Dee (no need for a middle name here) on the Winged Star. But also: the figures are swappable! You can unplug the riders from their machines, which will come in handy with upcoming Riders and Machines that are being teased. You can expect Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Gooey to come along with certain machines. I lack the experience with Kirby Air Riders to make any educated guess on those. Also, because Sakurai's 40-minute Direct focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders wasn't enough, there's going to be a second one in the near future. More updates on Hyrule Warriors: War of Imprisonment! The gameplay stuff sounds fun, but the most important bit is that it's Gameshare compatible: players will be able to play co-op across two consoles with just one copy of the game, including the original Switch model. It's a great move. I honestly wish more games offered this as a feature by default. Anyway, War of Imprisonment adds some new wrinkles to the Hyrule Warriors formula in the form of Tears of the Kingdom's Zonai tech. Using these ancient artifacts, players can mess with enemy groups or alter the battlefield. I appreciate the puzzle-based addition to the battles. I'm still not crazy for the post-Breath of the Wild Hyrule Warriors games because of the original Hyrule Warriors offering so much, but I can't knock them for actually trying to expand the formula. Few things disappoint me than how the gaming community has left Dragon Quest in an ivory tower. If everyone who namedropped Dragon Quest Monsters during the Palworld/Pokémon discourse had actually bought a copy of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Black Prince, Square Enix might have brought over more Dragon Quest Monsters games. And hey, all those arguments about Expedition 33 and Square Enix's turn-based games are incomplete without recognizing all of the work Square Enix has put into titles like Dragon Quest XI (like how the Switch adds a sprite-based mode for playing the game, a la the 3DS remakes). Dragon Quest isn't the end-all, be-all of Japanese RPGs, and there were plenty of other games that were made leading up to their original title on Famicom... but getting anyone to recognize Dragon Quest in America is an uphill battle. At any rate: Dragon Quest VII is getting a remake. And while it's not an HD-2D remake along the lines of the Erdrick Trilogy, it's nevertheless a top-to-bottom remake of the whole game. Er—another one, since we also had a comprehensive 3D remake of Dragon Quest VII back on the 3DS. Dragon Quest VII is a weird entry for the series; while tremendously overshadowed in the United States due to releasing alongside the graphical powerhouse that was Final Fantasy X, DQ7 also had a very long intro; famously, the PS1 original front-ended the game with a lot of puzzles, so much so that it could take you as long as five hours to encounter your first Slime in battle. Of course, there's a story reason: the protagonist accidentally petrifies his village, and he has to recover several stone tablets to break the curse. This whole quest has a very tragic ending, as many vignettes in Dragon Quest do, but it leads to a game that can have triple-digit length. Dragon Quest VII's deal is its class system: much like Final Fantasy V, characters can be given specific jobs for battle, with each victory leading towards improving their proficiency in that class. There are a lot of classes, many of which are unlocked as combinations of other classes. And that's before we get to the Monster classes, earned by fighting monsters. Yes, there's a Metal Slime class, and yes, it's a pain to unlock and master. Look forward to this one on February 5. Here's one that gets me: Nintendo is adding the Virtual Boy's library to the Nintendo Switch Online repertoire, along with other consoles like the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo 64. People have had words about this. For starters, the Virtual Boy was a failure of a console: its early attempts at 3D (plus everything being in shades of red) caused headaches, and the console wasn't very comfortable. All told, only 22 games were made for the console—14 of them are available on the NSO+Expansion service. This includes several... well, I can't call them "classics," but they're still noteworthy. Wario Land was the first game in the series, and had its first entry made on the Virtual Boy, making this the first time it's been ported, ever. There's also Jack Bros., a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off starring Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Jack Ripper. The point of contention is that the Virtual Boy games aren't available to play in 2D—they're exclusively designed for 3D play. So to play the Virtual Boy games, you'll need an accessory that effectively re-creates the original console that you'll slot your Switch or Switch 2 into. The accessory costs $100 USD, which I agree, is a lot. I understand why Nintendo made it; it's to keep the games in context and because they likely don't have a way to allow these games to be played in 2D without extensively reworking them—a tall order for 30-year-old games from a failed console. Nobody's playing a Virtual Boy game to play it in 2D anyhow, the way I see it. The bit where I scrunch my nose up is people doomsaying about the $100 add-on... when there's a $25 alternative that's also for sale. If you don't want to spend $100, you don't have to. Heck, I even appreciate that Nintendo found a new use for the Nintendo Labo components. But the discussion begins and ends with the $100 doohickey. I've seen other peers point out how Nintendo also offers Switch-compatible variants of older controllers, from the NES and N64 controllers to even the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controller for use with the NSO titles; a quick look at Nintendo's store reveals that those are all in the ballpark of $65. My dudes, the cardboard option is cheaper than a N64 controller. There's so much to complain about. I don't understand why this is the straw that breaks the camel's back, nor do I understand why people can't see the cheap option that's literally right there. Speaking of old stuff, Koei Tecmo is bringing back another Fatal Frame title with a remake of Crimson Butterfly. Originally released in 2003(!), Crimson Butterfly tells the story of a young woman named Mio searching for her twin sister, Mayu, in an abandoned town. Along the way, Mio investigates an old ritual that the village was undergoing. Jumpscares and creepy Japanese ghosts ensue. The series' traditional Camera Obscura is still the central mechanic, a camera that can banish ghosts. This one's another comprehensive top-to-bottom remake; if it's half as good as the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse remake from 2023 (which I reviewed), it'll be a treat! Others and I would definitely prefer a new Fatal Frame proper, but this is a good-enough stopgap. Look forward to it in early 2026. I am disappointed that nobody is talking about the new Suika Game. Suika Game was a huge hit among streamers and players alike, and countless Suika Game clones have emerged in its wake, like IntiCreates' PuzzMix. Just this past summer, Shift-Up even had a Suika Game-esque mini-game for their Boom The Ghost event in Goddess of Victory: NIKKE! In upping the ante, Aladdin X has taken the game to the only place left to go: space. Suika Game Planet has you dropping fruit into an orb at the center of the screen. You can arrange the fruit all around the planet, but they can't break its surface (it's more of a bubble, so the edges have some give). Another twist is in the form of Super Evolution, which grants you bonuses depending on how many fruits of which type you've combined in a row. It's even compatible with Game Share on the Switch 2! I don't expect Suika Game to register on most people's radar, but it'll definitely be a fun hit once it lands this Winter. A major twist was delivered regarding Metroid Prime 4: Samus has a sick sci-fi bike! The reveal comes along with the twist that Metroid Prime 4 is now seemingly an open-world game, with Samus riding her new bike across massive vistas in search of new locales to explore. There's some consternation over this, given that Metroid has been at its best when it's nurturing a claustrophobic vibe. I'm with them. The trailer shows a sequence of Samus facing off against a pack of wolf-like creatures during a blizzard; it seems so pedestrian for Samus to be fighting space-wolves, given all of the other bizarre alien life-forms she's encountered. Regardless: Metroid Prime 4 is slated for a December 4 release, with Amiibo and an art book set to release shortly beforehand. Donkey Kong Bananza has some DLC out now. Most of us expected DLC related to the twist reveal in Bananza, but the DLC is only tangentially related: you actually get to explore D.K. Island! It even plays the song from Donkey Kong 64! There's also the new Emerald Rush mode, a rogue-lite mode where Donkey Kong has to smash enough emerald ore within a time frame. You'll find fossils and stuff that can unlock perks as you run around smashing things, and better performance unlocks new stages in lower layers. A unique twist is that the locations for all of the ores and fossils are a constant, so you'll be able to strategize and plan out your route. The news of Pokémon: Pokopia has some people unsettled, if only because your player character is a Ditto who has shapeshifted (badly) into a human. This has deep ramifications for the world of Pokémon that nobody wants to contend with. The idea itself is fun; however, Ditto will meet other Pokémon and learn moves from them that allow it to modify the environment. As the environment is made more comfortable, more Pokémon arrive, teaching Ditto more moves that allow it to create a whole village for the Pokémon to live in. The idea has been likened to Dragon Quest Builders, which I feel is apt (provided I haven't played Dragon Quest Builders yet). It's a cute idea, and I can see it leading into explaining how Pokémon in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games have places to live. Let's go into a lightning round for some other titles: Danganronpa 2 is getting an expanded port with Danganronpa 2x2, which not only includes the base Danganronpa 2 but also a new scenario with a new story. It'll be available next year, also on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Dynasty Warriors Origins lands on Switch 2 this January 22, with paid DLC announced. Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections has a March 16 release date. Resident Evil 9 arrives for the Switch 2 on February 27, wildly enough, with Resident Evil VII and Resident Evil: Village in tow. A new Fire Emblem is coming! Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave takes the series to a Greco-Roman setting, where some would-be heroes duke it out in front of their regent in the hopes of having a wish granted. Some fight for revenge, others fight for someone else. Sothis from Fire Emblem: Three Houses is back, so maybe this takes place in the same world? Who knows. I have an issue with Fortune's Weave, though. Several of the lead characters have darker skin; the protagonist we see is ostensibly a Black young man. His design is otherwise okay. I love his hair (he doesn't have the Killmonger haircut!). But a problem he and the other darker-skinned characters have is that they all have an ashy skin color. It does them a disservice. Mika Pikazo took a lot of heat for the toothpaste hair in Fire Emblem Engage, but she did right by the dark-skinned cast like Timerra by giving them beautiful skin tones. Even in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Claude's olive skintone belied his Mediterranean-inspired origins. So it's a disappointment that the ball was dropped with Fortune's Weave. Still, the cast seems interesting, the designs are nice, and I especially like the hairstyles. So I'm hopeful. Here's where everyone lost their marbles. Paid DLC has been announced for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which releases this October 16. Now, this DLC includes new story content, as well as two new Mega Evolutions for Raichu (Raichu X and Raichu Y). The announcement of paid DLC before the game has launched has people outraged... as though this is the first time any game has been announced with paid DLC at launch. The trailer also reveals new Mega Evolutions for the Kalosian starters, Delphox, Chesknight, and Greninja. Notably, these three Pokémon didn't have Mega Evolutions in their original game, which, in the eyes of many, was an oversight. Legends Z-A corrects this... but also, the Mega Stones for these Mega Evolutions are barred behind timed ranked play over the course of three in-game seasons. There has been a lot of discourse about this being beyond the pale and a sign of Nintendo's modern-day "greed." Let's break this down for a minute. First off: the DLC. Where have people been for the past decade? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate had announced paid DLC before it launched, too! And the only carrot on that stick was knowing that the first character in the DLC list was the Piranha Plant! Nintendo has done this with all three Xenoblade Chronicles games on the Switch, going back to Xenoblade 2! Getting the Season passes was how you unlocked a stash of items and the post-game stories (which are effectively games unto themselves). This isn't new! This hasn't been new for years! You can't even say it's exclusive to Nintendo—Sonic Racing Crossworlds also has been promoting paid DLC for the game, and that game hasn't launched either! There's a lot to argue over paid DLC as a means of bilking people out of their money, but that discussion has long since passed us by. One of the funniest clips from my favorite Vtuber is her going through almost a minute's worth of prompts from all the cosmetic DLC she bought before playing the game. For better or worse, paid DLC is just a standard factor in games these days. And you're telling me it's a problem now? In a Pokémon game? I've seen people claim that this artificially inflates the price of Pokémon Legends: Z-A--again, where have people been? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate costs $120 with both season passes—and you're going to want those, if you want to use Kazuya Mishima or Steve! It disturbs me how much people make this their hill to die on after actual years of literally every other publisher and developer going through with it. Especially since this is now such an entrenched belief with people. It's a truism that Nintendo is especially greedy, patent-starved and disrespectful to its fans and you're the crazy one if you bring up receipts proving otherwise. These are stances I can understand coming from rage-bait content creators online, who have the ears of the entire fandom. I am puzzled that people who should know better fall into these talking points. It's not even that paid DLC isn't a bad thing—it's sure as hell not, especially not since so many games had actual content cut from the main game just to be turned into DLC. That people decided Pokémon was where things were a bridge too far is what blows my mind. I half-expect that if Nintendo ever introduces a gacha system in a Pokémon game, it will finally prompt the rest of the industry to abandon the practice. There's also consternation about Pokémon imported from Pokémon Home getting stuck in Legends Z-A if and when they're imported. Again, not fun! I don't like this! But I understand why it's happening: Legends Z-A has a unique battle system and Pokémon data likely has to be reformatted to accommodate it, and it'll likely be too much of a pain to reformat Legends Z-A data back out of Legends Z-A. This means that the unique Mega Evolutions in Legends Z-A are landlocked into the game... for now. Seriously, there's no way Mega Victreebell or Mega Hawlucha aren't going to be made available some other way. Pokémon Champions is still releasing soon, after all. Again, this is disappointing... but people know that you can't import Pokémon from the first two Generations into Gen 3 onward, right? Even now, there's no legal alternative to get Pokémon from Pokémon Gold out of those games. Sure, there were digital alternatives on the 3DS—but if you wanted to rescue your old Lugia from your old cartridge, there's no official means. I'll go a step further, because as much as I dislike this, I still don't think it's the worst. Monster Rancher 4 had an exclusive in-game monster based on Kasumi from Dead or Alive. The only way to get her was by scanning a copy of Dead or Alive: Hardcore for the PlayStation 2. So you had to spend $100 to buy two games, to get a special-edition Monster. And that's just Kasumi—I'm not counting White Hound, a unique variant of the default Tiger monsters. You could only get White Hound in Monster Rancher 4 by scanning a DVD copy of Princess Mononoke (or Red Hot Chili Peppers' By The Way album). That's another, what? $30 USD? And I haven't even gotten to all of the other exclusive monsters. And then there's Yokai Watch 2's Local Yokai, which you could only get by playing participating Yokai Watch arcade games in certain regions of Japan. That's right: you had to physically travel across the country to get all the cards with the QR codes for these promotional monsters. Or buy the cards second-hand, which still takes money. It's bizarre how much anger gets levied towards Pokémon because I can point to so many similar issues from other monster-taming RPGs. And I think this really highlights the hollowness of much of the discourse surrounding the titles. It doesn't even invalidate the criticisms, but it definitely puts Pokémon into context. But that's the context that usually gets lost since most people don't look into the genre past Pokémon. That'll do it for this week. It's been a bit since I had a column this long... I stepped back and took a screenshot of the whole column when I had finished writing up the Nintendo Direct breakdown, and it was already long enough to be a column unto itself. That's what they pay me for, babes...! I might actually be glibbed out this time. Be good to each other. I'll see you in seven. This Week in Games homepage / archives

Title: AI Agents Are Coming For Your Buildings. Is Your Office Ready?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronschmelzer/2025/09/19/ai-agents-are-coming-for-your-buildings-is-your-office-ready/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T14:48:34Z

ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. So-called intelligent automation has been in buildings for decades. Facility systems could dim lights or adjust temperatures, but only after humans set the rules. Operators fiddled with thermostats, tweaked schedules, and tried to balance comfort with utility bills. These systems followed instructions. They didn’t think. Now Trane Technologies is taking a different approach. This week the company rolled out AI Control and ARIA, an AI agent for buildings. The move marks a push from pre-programmed automation toward adaptive intelligence. It also fits into a broader trend. Companies in many industries are embedding AI agents into daily operations so that machines no longer just assist, they act. Conventional Building Automation Systems work like scripts. Once written, they run. Trane’s new AI Control is closer to a continuously adaptive process. It draws data from weather forecasts, occupancy sensors, and energy meters, then makes adjustments every few minutes. Heating and cooling shift on the fly, not just at set times. Trane says this approach can cut up to 25% of energy use and reduce emissions by as much as 40%. Commercial real estate consumes almost 40% of global energy, so the stakes are high. Even small improvements can translate to billions saved and a measurable climate benefit. “Our vision is to unlock next-generation building performance, delivering both immediate and long-term benefits for our customers and the planet,” said Riaz Raihan, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, Trane Technologies, according to a recent press release. Unlike a BAS dashboard that waits for commands, ARIA, Trane’s AI building agent, uses a conversational approach with building staff. Ask it for an energy forecast, a performance update, or a system change. It responds, acts, and adapts. That shifts the role of facility managers. Rather than tuning equipment line by line, they supervise a digital operator that never takes a break. Similar patterns are already playing out elsewhere. In retail, autonomous shopping bots fill carts. In finance, algorithmic systems trade at high speed. Buildings could be next. Buildings generate tons of data. HVAC sensors, security feeds, and occupancy trackers continuously churn out data. Yet much of it goes unused because teams can’t respond fast enough. But AI agents can. ARIA’s five-minute optimization cycles allow adjustments that humans could never sustain. Over time, those small improvements can accumulate into large savings. The timing matters. Energy costs remain unpredictable, and regulators are raising the bar. In New York City, Local Law 97 fines owners who exceed emissions caps. Smarter systems don’t just save money, they help properties avoid penalties. These new tools emerged from Trane’s recently launched BrainBox AI Lab, acquired earlier this year to accelerate Trane’s AI innovation pipeline. Positioned as an incubator, the lab focuses on rapid development of control strategies that improve efficiency without manual oversight. Competitors are moving in the same direction. Johnson Controls has been folding machine learning into its OpenBlue platform. Siemens has expanded its Desigo CC system with AI modules that highlight integration across building systems. Trane is trying to stand apart by framing ARIA as a system that doesn’t just provide data, but takes initiative. Across industries, AI agents are seeing increasing adoption. In retail, Walmart, Instacart, and Shopify are testing digital buyers that anticipate needs and complete orders. In finance, trading platforms at JPMorgan and BlackRock use autonomous systems to scan markets and act on risk models. Healthcare companies are also making agentic AI investments, with Philips and GE Healthcare are piloting agents in ICUs that monitor patients continuously, freeing staff from constant checks. The common thread is that tools once seen as assistants now operate independently. Humans step back into oversight roles. For all the potential, adoption in the building industry faces challenges. Trust is the first issue. Managers won’t cede control without safeguards. They need clear explanations for why the system acts, along with an override button when comfort or safety is at stake. These systems also need to prove their value. AI agents need to show that they can deliver better results than their human counterparts. Early deployments will face close scrutiny as facility managers track cost reductions and emissions savings. Other industries show how this might play out. Finance managers resisted algorithmic trading until performance proved to be a competitive advantage. Healthcare hesitated with diagnostic AI until error rates dropped and clinicians saw the benefit. Facility management may follow a similar path. If systems like ARIA catch on, the role of the facility manager changes. Instead of adjusting dampers and thermostats, they’ll monitor, interpret, and decide when to intervene. The work becomes less mechanical and more strategic. That echoes changes in trading floors, hospitals, and retail supply chains. People now guide the agents rather than carry out every action. Trane’s release is a sign of the change in the industry. Within a few years, AI-native control may become the baseline for commercial properties, not a premium add-on. The unknowns lie in the business model. Will operators pay recurring fees for optimization? Will insurers reward AI-run properties with lower premiums? Will tenants expect AI-managed comfort as part of the lease? For now, Trane has made its move. The company is betting that buildings with their own digital operator will define the next stage of “smart.”

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Blackrock clinic co-founder among objectors to apartment plans
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/19/blackrock-clinic-co-founder-among-objectors-to-apartment-plans/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T14:31:40Z
Full Content:
James M Sheehan. the co-founder of the Blackrock, Hermitage and Galway Clinics, is opposing plans by Cairn Homes for 252 residential ‘build to sell’ units in Blackrock in south Dublin. Mr Sheehan is one of over 30 local residents opposing the scheme which is made up of 236 apartments and 16 houses at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co. Dublin. The 236 apartments are to be located in two blocks ranging in height from five to eight storeys while the 16 homes will be five bedroom terrace houses. In his objection, Mr Sheehan claims that the scheme “will erode the long established character of the neighbourhood”. Mr Sheehan of Cross Avenue, Blackrock contends that “numerous properties will lose their privacy due to the height of the proposed apartment blocks”. He said that the “high rise blocks are inappropriate for this neighbourhood” and argues that it is overdevelopment. Mr Sheehan states that “a low rise development with open spaces could be appropriate such as St Helen’s Wood”. In a comprehensive objection lodged on behalf of Catherine Greene, planning consultant, David Armstrong contends that “the over-development and over-densification of this suburban site will result in a congested form of development and a poor standard of amenity for future residents”. Mr Armstrong contends that “the proposal will result in negative impacts due to loss of residential amenity, visual amenity traffic and overspill parking.” Alan and Charlotte Sullivan of Cross Avenue, Blackrock contend that “there is undoubtedly very significant local opposition to the proposed development”. The O’Sullivans state that “it appears clear to us from the size of the proposed development that the objective is to maximise commercial gain at the expense of amenity in the local area and in disregard of local residents and the local community”. Cairn has been trying to develop the site for the past seven years and last year An Coimisiún Pleanála refused planning permission for 355 build to rent apartments as it would lead to an over-proliferation of build to rent apartments for the area. Addressing ACP’s grounds for refusal on the proliferation of ‘built to rent’ apartments for the area, planning consultants for the new scheme, McCutcheon Halley Chartered Planning Consultants (MHP) state that new scheme in contrast “offers 252 built to sell (BTS) units, which align with the identified housing needs in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and contributes to addressing Ireland’s housing demand”. MHP say the scheme “will facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is also located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village”. A decision is due next month.

Title: CleanSpark: Buy The CLSK Stock Rally Before It's Too Late?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/19/cleanspark-buy-the-clsk-stock-rally-before-its-too-late/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T13:15:23Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CleanSpark stock (NASDAQ:CLSK) has seen a sharp rise, gaining over 40% in the past month. This surge comes after the company reported a 38% increase in bitcoins mined during August, driven by a significant boost in its operational hashrate, which reached 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second)—a critical measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network. The company achieved this milestone in June 2025. The broader cryptocurrency market has also shown strong momentum. Other Bitcoin miners, like IREN and MARA, have posted gains recently. This upward trend has been supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, with further cuts expected—an environment generally seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin’s near-term outlook looking positive, we expect Bitcoin mining companies to continue growing. A few months ago, we noted that the initial jump in CLSK could mark the start of a larger rally. Since then, the stock has climbed over 30%, and we still see it as well-positioned for further gains. In the following sections, we’ll take a deeper look at CLSK—comparing its current valuation with its operational performance over recent years and reviewing its financial health. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Separately, see – CrowdStrike: What’s Happening With CRWD Stock? Looking at what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CLSK stock appears slightly undervalued compared to the overall market, especially considering its strong revenue growth. Cleanspark's Revenues have grown rapidly in recent years. Cleanspark’s profit margins lag behind most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Cleanspark’s balance sheet appears very strong. CLSK stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, what if another recession hits? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how major stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes. Summarizing Cleanspark’s metrics: • Growth: Very Strong• Profitability: Weak• Financial Stability: Very Strong• Downturn Resilience: Weak• Overall: Strong Overall, CleanSpark has performed well across the metrics we’ve analyzed. Given its moderate valuation, we believe the stock still has significant upside potential. When we look at the competition, CleanSpark appears undervalued. For example, IREN trades at 17 times its trailing revenue, MARA at 8 times, and RIOT at 11 times. In comparison, CleanSpark’s valuation is much lower at 6 times revenues, suggesting it could be poised for growth to catch up to its peers. Now, of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors might continue to value CLSK conservatively, especially considering its historical volatility. We think the long-term outlook is positive. For investors with a risk tolerance and a 3-to-5-year investment horizon, we continue to believe CLSK stock could deliver substantial returns. Still, single-stock investing carries risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a collection of 30 stocks—has consistently outperformed its benchmark (the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000). This is because HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with lower risk than the index, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan is finally getting religion on risk-taking — here’s why
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/09/19/business/bank-of-america-boss-brian-moynihan-is-finally-getting-religion-on-risk-taking-heres-why/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Bank of America’s boss may be finally getting religion on risk-taking – and it looks like a possible bid to keep his job, On The Money has learned. CEO Brian Moynihan – who has been notoriously cautious leading the nation’s No. 2 bank since the 2008 financial crisis – surprised and delighted insiders and investors alike as he promoted Jim DeMare to group co-president – positioning him as his possible successor. The reception was joyful partly because inside BofA, DeMare is considered the anti-Moynihan: He’s not from the big bank’s retail banking side, nor is he a lawyer like Moynihan. Instead, he’s a longtime trader who has been running BofA’s capital markets division and its real estate lending business. His elevation as BofA’s possible CEO-in-waiting also looks like the bank’s current CEO is listening to critics both internally and on Wall Street pushing Moynihan to embrace risk taking to juice earnings and a stock price that has lagged the competition. As On The Money has reported, Moynihan, who has led the nation’s second-largest bank for the past 15 years, is known for his wokeness (strict adherence to DEI until recently and “debanking” conservatives over the years including President Trump). He’s also known for a plodding and overly cautious management style. You could argue – as some of Moynihan’s supporters have – that his risk avoidance has kept BofA out of trouble since 2008, which almost spelled its doom. During Moynihan’s tenure as CEO, BofA’s stock is up more than 400% with no major scandal or existential trading loss. True, but consider: JPMorgan, run by Jamie Dimon, is up nearly 700% during that time. JPM uses its balance sheet all the time to win deals, and its balance sheet is among the banking sector’s strongest. Also getting a bump to co-president is Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking, setting up a horse race between two of the big bank’s top executives. Until the unrest began bubbling up this year over Moynihan’s weak-kneed management, Athanasia was seen as the odds-on favorite to be the next CEO. As one BofA insider put it: “He’s the carbon copy of Brian; a retail banker who looks at capital markets as an afterthought. They are literally the same person in different bodies.” DeMare, meanwhile, is seen as a charismatic leader, well-liked by his troops. Moynihan’s supporters say the reason DeMare has been able to outperform — 13 straight quarters of his division cranking out profits — is because the CEO gave him the portfolio to do so. Maybe, but his emergence is seen as proof that risk is in the air at BofA. He’s odds-on favorite for the top job since he provides expertise in capital markets that the bank needs to better compete with JPM. That’s if he sticks around. As reported, Moynihan, 65, says he wants to stay as CEO until he’s 70. Both Athanasia, 59, and the 56-year-old DeMare head large swaths of BofA’s balance sheet. But given their age, they may not wait for Moynihan to call it quits if the right CEO opportunity emerges elsewhere. Other names could make the short list include Holly O’Neill, president, consumer, retail; Lindsay Hans the head of wealth management; and Wendy Stewart, president of global commercial banking. That’s why there’s talk inside BofA that Moynihan might leave sooner than his stated end-date of 2030. “Brian staying until 2030 is like those promises to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” said another BofA insider. “People keep talking about it but no one thinks it’s realistic. “ A BofA rep had no comment.

Title: Bitcoin’s Big Flip: More Stable Than the Nasdaq 100 as Best Altcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Benefits

There’s a massive shift occurring in the financial world, and it’s a big deal for Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped below that of nearly every company on the Nasdaq 100 index. A cryptocurrency once known for its wild, unpredictable price has now become more stable than giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. The data in CEX.io’s report shows that over the past 3 months, Bitcoin’s realized volatility is now lower than 99 of the 100 companies in the index. Just a month ago, it was steadier than 91% of them. It seems the days of Bitcoin’s stomach-churning volatility might be behind us. Exciting developments being brought to the Bitcoin network by projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) further signal a bullish momentum is building for $BTC. With nearly $17M raised on presale and a promise to turn Bitcoin from a store of value into a DeFi-ready ecosystem, $HYPER stands out as one of the best altcoins today. The CEX.io report explains that it’s all about maturity. As Bitcoin’s market cap has exploded, it’s created a much deeper liquidity pool. Basically, there’s a lot more money flowing in and out of the market, which means a single big buyer or seller can’t rock the boat like they used to. This is a significant vote of confidence for Bitcoin, demonstrating its status as a serious investment. What’s even more impressive is that Bitcoin hasn’t sacrificed its returns for this new stability. It outperformed almost all of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks, a famous group of tech behemoths like Alphabet and Nvidia. In fact, among that group, Bitcoin’s gains were only topped by Alphabet. You’re not just getting a calmer asset; you’re getting one that’s still delivering spectacular results. Let’s face it, results are what’s important, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is shaping up to deliver in a big way with increased speed and development on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been the gold standard of crypto: secure, decentralized, and a rock-solid store of value. But let’s be honest, it’s not exactly built for speed. Transaction are slow and fees get high during network congestion, making it tough to use for daily payments or cutting-edge dApps. It offloads network traffic off Bitcoin’s L1 through a canonical bridge, which securely cross-mints wrapped $BTC ($wBTC) on the Hyper network. While the $wBTC is usable for L2 dApps and DeFi protocols, Bitcoin’s L1 remains the settlement layer. The L2 taps into the incredible speed of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which helps unlock lightning-fast, ultra-cheap transactions and a new universe of possibilities for Bitcoin. This isn’t about replacing Bitcoin; it’s about making it faster, more flexible, and future-proof. Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website to learn more. The Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem combines Bitcoin’s security and Solana’s speed, making it a perfect combo for the Web3 world where Bitcoin risks being left behind. The $HYPER token is the fuel that powers this upcoming ecosystem, and the project’s promise has drawn in a lot of bullish investors. As the project races towards its mainnet launch in Q3, with top exchange listings following in Q4, $HYPER is poised to become a core part of the Bitcoin universe. Indeed, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has been a massive success, raising over $16.8M so far. It’s a massive vote of confidence that shows people are hungry for ways to make Bitcoin more useful. With $HYPER fueling network fees, DAO governance, and giving 68% APY rewards to early presale buyers, its incentives and value as a utility token make it an attractive play in late 2025. Remember, this isn’t financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

Title: The mystery of Nvidia’s underperforming stock

Nvidia may be the biggest name in the artificial-intelligence boom, but the stock has lagged behind peers over the past few months. “Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, it’s hard to find a stronger performer than Nvidia," Bespoke Investment Group wrote on Wednesday. The market research group noted that Nvidia shares were up 982% from that date through their record close on Aug. 12. However, Nvidia’s footing has looked increasingly shaky, especially relative to other AI-linked stocks. A basket of stocks including foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, data-storage company Seagate Technology, and memory-chip maker Micron has gained 68.2% since Oct. 31, 2024; Nvidia has gained just 28.3% since then. The underperformance is evident even when comparing Nvidia to other stocks, not just chip makers. Bespoke’s “Picks & Shovels" basket, which includes energy and data-center infrastructure stocks like Constellation Energy, Vistra, NRG Energy, and Quanta Services has gained nearly 61% since Oct. 31—more than twice as much as Nvidia. The latest leg of the performance gap was kicked off by earnings from Oracle earlier this month, Bespoke noted. It revealed a significant increase in Oracle’s backlog for contracted work. “We don’t have a strong thesis as to why NVDA has been such a relative underperformer over the past month," the research group admitted. Investor expectations were high, but Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report was far from a bust. Adjusted earnings, revenue, and third-quarter revenue guidance all came in above expectations. One might think the company’s troubles in China are spooking investors. Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed last month to give the Trump administration a 15% cut of their AI-chip sales in the country. Then, on Wednesday, a report suggested Chinese companies had been banned from purchasing Nvidia’s semiconductors. But the stock actually inched up following confirmation from the White House in August. And even though shares tumbled on Wednesday, closing down 2.6%, they bounced back on Thursday. Even if Chinese sales are challenged, “other buyers appear to be as desperate as ever to get their hands on NVDA GPUs," Bespoke added. The market for GPUs, however, may not be as strong as it once was. Bespoke notes that the cost to rent GPU’s has been declining, and a look at the Silicon Data H100 Rental Index, which tracks the hourly cost of renting a graphics processing unit, suggests that is accurate. The index climbed to $2.89 an hour in mid-April, but was down to $2.41 one month later, before slipping to $2.15 on Thursday. “Part of that is thanks to the introduction of their Blackwell line, which is generally more efficient, but it remains the case that data centers are chasing falling prices for a given level of capacity," Bespoke added. It’s difficult to predict where Nvidia will go next—and the stock isn’t falling, just lagging. In fact, the concerns may be much ado about nothing. But the market has a way of sniffing out problems before investors do, creating something of a quandry. “It wouldn’t be the first time that a secular winner faces a narrative test before continuing to surge if that ends up playing out," Bespoke wrote. “But we are somewhat surprised at how little attention the underperformance of the largest listed U.S. stock is getting, especially relative to other adjacent names." And now investors have to make sense of Nvidia’s partnership with Intel to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers, an announcement that sent shares up 3.5% on Thursday. It’s almost enough to make one give up on AI altogether. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Title: Public-Private Genocide?
URL: http://opiniojuris.org/2025/09/19/public-private-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T10:00:48Z

In association with the International Commission of Jurists [Professor Sundhya Pahuja is ARC Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate Professor and Professor of international law at the University of Melbourne. She is the Director of the Laureate Program in Global Corporations and International Law. Dr. André Dao is a postdoctoral research fellow with the Laureate Program] On 30 June 2025, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese issued a report detailing corporate complicity in Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and genocide against the Palestinian people. Special Rapporteurs are independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate and report on specific human rights situations or themes around the world. Albanese provides a forensic account of how corporations across eight sectors, including arms manufacturers, tech firms and extractive industries, are both crucial to, and profit from, Israel’s violations of international law. The report thus provides a map of the specific corporations and sectors involved in the genocide. The report comes at a time when many people are growing uneasy about the increasing power and impunity of corporations, particularly as the state in many places is becoming authoritarian. From modern slavery to climate change, and from war profiteering to genocide, major corporations around the world seem to be able to harm people and planet with impunity. The global movement to hold corporations to account for harmful behaviour has steadily gained ground. But Albanese’s recent report, entitled ‘From economy of occupation to economy of genocide’, is a landmark statement in challenging corporate impunity. It advances a new vision of corporate accountability that understands that many of the world’s harms are the result of states and corporations working closely together. The existing mechanisms for holding corporations to account are inadequate to the task. The most important, in the field of Business and Human Rights (BHR), is encapsulated in a document known as the United Nations Guiding Principles (the UNGPs). The UNGPs were a compromise response to demands by many states and civil society activists for something much stronger than what eventuated, in both substance and form, for holding corporations to account. Formulated by Harvard Professor John Ruggie in the mid-2000s, the success of the UNGPs lies in their widespread acceptance by the business world. This uptake is largely due to their voluntary nature and their reliance on language and tools corporations are familiar with. Chief among these is the stipulation that all corporations should carry out ‘human rights due diligence’. In substance, this is a tool that encourages corporations to investigate and mitigate the risk of potential human rights violations in the same way they would approach more familiar financial or legal risks. But what attracts corporations to the UNGPs is also their weak point for everyone else. Besides being voluntary and not binding, by translating human rights into the language of risk management, due diligence makes it possible for corporations to focus narrowly on discrete harms rather than on the effects of their business models as a whole. And in practice, the human rights risk assessments at the heart of due diligence are often an opportunity for corporations to ‘balance’ presumed economic benefits to vulnerable peoples against actual human rights violations. A similar problem plagues the other core regime of accountability for grievous corporate conduct, international criminal law (ICL). As a mechanism for holding individuals within companies responsible for corporate harms, ICL dates from the Nuremberg trial of directors of IG Farben, the German chemicals manufacturer responsible for amongst other acts, making the Zyklon B gas used in the concentration camp chambers. Unlike BHR, ICL is binding, and punishing individual decision-makers can meet some victims’ demands for justice. But like BHR, it also misses the structural point, both by being confined to individual actors within corporations, and by taking a ‘few bad apples’ approach to corporate misconduct, normalising wider patterns of harm. Even were international criminal responsibility to be extended to corporations themselves rather than the individuals within them, this structural problem would remain, and the deleterious effects of ‘business as usual’ would remain unchallenged. This is particularly problematic when corporations operate within, and often in close partnership with, undemocratic states. As many scholars have detailed, the Holocaust could not have happened without corporate complicity. A few corporate leaders were tried, but most companies complicit with the regime escaped unscathed. Many still operate today. What is less widely known is that Fascists (first the Italian version, then the German version) invented the modern practice of ‘privatisation’. This involved handing over control of state-owned monopolies to corporations. This had the immediate consequence of shoring up business support for the regimes of Mussolini and Hitler. In the longer term, it created a certain pattern of power, whereby economic control and benefit was concentrated in a wealthy, fascist-supporting elite and away from the ‘public’. At the same time, the state maintained its monopoly on legitimate violence, which was re-orientated in service of private corporations. It is telling that the man who popularised the concept of privatisation in the Anglosphere, the management consultant Peter Drucker, originally called it re-privatisation. He meant that giving private corporations responsibility over ‘economic’ life was merely to return to them a responsibility they had held before the late nineteenth century, which had seen the birth of the modern public sector through successive waves of nationalisation and municipalisation. Drucker’s argument sought to naturalise privatisation in modern democratic states. In fact, he was more correct than he realised, but in a different way: long before the 19th century, private corporations had been responsible for engaging in colonial conquest and colonial government. The ‘public’ colony of British India, for instance, was originally ruled for over 200 years by the ‘private’ British East India Company. Colonialism was, in other words, always a form of public-private partnership. Today, many states going “bad” are led by authoritarian populists supported by big business, who are in turn supported by those leaders. Think of the conclave of oligarchs standing behind Donald Trump at his inauguration, Adani’s funding of Narendra Modi after the Gujarat massacre, or the concentration of media ownership among businessmen linked to Victor Orbán in Hungary. This form of company-state relation far exceeds mere ‘corruption’. It represents what we might call empire coming home: a technology of governance from the colonial encounter, used to extend a form of public-private rule over distant peoples, is now turned inwards, upon the state’s ‘own’ people. This intimacy between corporation and state is at the heart of Albanese’s report. Refusing the tendency of Business and Human Rights and international criminal law to focus on discrete, ‘rogue’ behaviour, Albanese insists on understanding corporate crimes in a long historical trajectory. Thus the very first line of the report acknowledges that ‘colonial endeavours and associated genocides have historically been driven and enabled by the corporate sector’. This turn to history then makes it possible to see that the activities of major corporations such as IBM, Caterpillar, and Blackrock in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories is not incidental or aberrant, but part of a longstanding pattern of power. The innovative part of Albanese’s report is that she does not jettison human rights or international criminal law, but instead reworks them so that they can begin to address genocide and other serious harms as the result of a public-private partnership. One of the ways she does this is by refocusing corporate accountability efforts on how corporations’ ‘specific human rights violations may also be constitutive of more structural and systemic violations of international law’. In the case of Palestine, this means that corporate due diligence is not satisfied simply by muddying the evidentiary waters over whether a specific weapons part was used to commit a specific violation. It is the very relationship itself between company and state that enables, among other things, the systemic violation of Palestinians’ right to self-determination. And as Albanese points out, the systemic nature of this violation invalidates ‘paternalistic’ arguments about the economic benefits of continued engagement with Israel’s occupation regime. The response to Albanese’s report has confirmed its significance. Nine days after Albanese filed the report, the US government announced it was imposing sanctions on her for ‘writing threatening letters to dozens of entities worldwide, including major American companies across finance, technology, defense, energy, and hospitality, making extreme and unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC pursue investigations and prosecutions of these companies and their executives.’ These letters to corporations were deemed by US Secretary of State, Mark Rubio, to constitute ‘political and economic warfare, which threatens our national interests and sovereignty.’ The ‘our’ says it all, revealing the US’ own perception about how to understand its ‘national’ interest. When it comes to the genocide in Gaza, as was the case throughout colonial history, public and private interests – and culpability – are inextricably linked.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Cintas (NASDAQ: CTAS) stock, which provides corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, is set to announce its fiscal first quarter 2026 results (closing in May) on Wednesday, September 24. Analysts predict earnings of $1.20 per share on $2.70 billion in revenue, indicating a 7% growth in EPS and an 8% increase in sales compared to last year's figures of $1.12 per share on $2.50 billion. Historically, CTAS stock has increased after earnings announcements 72% of the time, with an average one-day gain of 3.7% and a maximum move of 8%. The company concluded FY25 on a strong note, posting Q4 revenue of $2.67 billion (+8% YoY) with EPS of $1.09 (+9%), while its operating margin improved to 22.4%. For the full year, revenue grew by 7.7% to $10.34 billion, and EPS surged 16% to $4.40. For FY26, management has projected revenue between $11.0 and $11.15 billion and EPS between $4.71 and $4.85, emphasizing stable growth and enduring profitability. Separately, check out Rocket Lab: How Low Can RKLB Stock Really Go? With a market capitalization close to $80 billion, trailing 12-month revenue of $10 billion, $2.4 billion in operating profit, and $1.8 billion in net income, Cintas is decidedly profitable. For traders focused on events, the situation is straightforward: either position in advance of earnings based on historical likelihoods, or await the announcement and trade based on the relationship between short-term movements and medium-term results. For those looking for a more consistent option, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio —up 91% since its inception—has regularly outperformed the S&P 500. See earnings reaction history of all stocks. Additional data on observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation and implementing the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns.

Seven tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – have driven massive gains on Wall Street over the past decade, collectively earning an eye-popping 698% between 2015 and 2024, according to The Motley Fool. The S&P 500 as a whole returned a comparatively modest 178% in those years. If you own shares of any broad index fund that tracks large American companies, you probably own shares of the Magnificent Seven. In 2015, the Magnificent Seven made up 12% of the total market value of the S&P 500. In 2025, the seven companies account for 34% of that value. Anyone who has owned Magnificent Seven stock over those years has reason to rejoice. They are the toast of Wall Street. “The Magnificent Seven are heroes,” said Jim Cramer, a CNBC stock-market pundit, in a Sept. 15 broadcast. “And I’m not going to tell you to sell heroes, unless something changes that makes them feel a lot less heroic.” Why would anyone consider selling a stake in the Magnificent Seven? Here are some reasons. First of all, market forecasts suggest the Magnificent Seven are overpriced. Economists measure the value of a stock by a formula called cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio. It measures a stock’s price against corporate earnings. It tells you, in effect, whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. Right now, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 39.7. That means stock prices are very expensive, relative to earnings. Forecasters point to two prior moments when the CAPE Ratio ran high. One was in 1929. The other was in 1999. In the decades that followed those peaks, the stock market plummeted. Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have higher price-to-earnings ratios than the S&P 500 as a whole, according to another Motley Fool analysis. That means Magnificent Seven stocks are historically overvalued. Based on that premise, Vanguard projects that U.S. growth stocks, a category the Magnificent Seven dominate, will rise by only 1.9% to 3.9% annually over the next decade. Despite the red flags, investors are still scooping up Magnificent Seven stocks. Nvidia stock is up 28% on the year, as of Sept. 18. Meta is up 31%. Alphabet is up 32%. “I own them. I love them. I’m going to keep holding them for the next 10 years. That’s what I do,” said David Gardner, co-founder of Motley Fool. Motley Fool includes two of the Seven, Alphabet and Amazon, on its current list of 10 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold. The Magnificent Seven have plenty of upsides. They are some of the most successful companies in history, lauded for technological innovation, global reach and brand recognition, strong revenue and earnings, and diverse operations that can adapt to changing market conditions. “Here you’re talking about concentration in seven of the most profitable, most diversified companies in the world,” said Jonathan Swanburg, a certified financial planner in Houston. Whatever your opinion about the Magnificent Seven, if you are an index-fund investor, you may own more of the stocks than you realize. “The first step would be to understand just how much exposure you have to them,” said Andrew Patterson, head of active research at Vanguard. The runaway success of the Seven has reshaped the stock market, with the Magnificent Seven at its core. If you have $1,000 invested in a typical S&P index fund, roughly $340 of that money is tied up in the Magnificent Seven. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple, alone, make up more than 20% of the value of the typical S&P index fund, and nearly 20% of the typical “total stock market” index fund. As a rule, market concentration is considered a bad thing. Investors are urged to diversify: not to hold only stocks, and not to hold too much of any one stock. Because of the massive gains by Magnificent Seven stocks, many everyday investors now own more of those stocks – and more stocks in general – than they intended. An investor who started out with a 60-40 mix of stocks and bonds may now own a 70-30 mix: The stocks have outperformed the bonds. Whether you own too much Magnificent Seven stock, or too much stock in general, depends on your tolerance for risk and how far you are from retirement, among other factors, Patterson said. A potential solution is rebalancing: Invest in other asset classes. Maybe even sell some of your Magnificent Seven stock. To avoid market concentration and overpriced stocks, forecasters say, here are some other investments to consider:

Title: Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay deal is ambitious — but so was his last 'mammoth' one, tech guru says

Tesla's $1 trillion pay deal for Elon Musk has triggered the same skepticism that greeted his ambitious 2018 pay deal, tech investor Eric Schiffer has said. In a wide-ranging interview with Business Insider, the CEO of private-equity firm the Patriarch Organization said Musk's previous deal also tied a "mammoth" payout to extremely challenging goals. That agreement required Musk to grow Tesla's market value from around $60 billion to $650 billion, its 12-month revenue from below $20 billion to $175 billion, and its adjusted profits from under $1.5 billion to $14 billion to get the full compensation. Schiffer recalled the deal was labeled "insane" and "crazy," with commentators declaring there was "no way in hell he'll ever achieve that." "And you know what, he did," Schiffer added. Under the company's latest plan, Musk would have 10 years to raise Tesla's market value from around $1.3 trillion to $8.5 trillion, boost its adjusted profits to $400 billion, deliver 20 million Tesla vehicles and a million Bots, reach 10 million active full self-driving (FSD) subscriptions, and bring a million robotaxis into commercial operation. "If he were to accomplish that, investors would do backflips, and of course, he should be compensated," Schiffer said. Awarding $1 trillion worth of stock to a CEO who's built an $8.5 trillion company would be reasonable, he added. Schiffer told Business Insider that the AI frenzy may have shades of the dot-com bubble at the turn of this century, but he's not worried about a crash. Many dot-com players were loss-making and had valuations "astronomically out of whack," Schiffer said. By contrast, Meta, Alphabet, and the other tech titans leading the AI charge are "money gushers" showing no signs of slowing down. Schiffer gave the example of Oracle, which recently disclosed that its expected contract revenue more than quadrupled year on year to $455 billion last quarter, thanks to strong AI demand. The software giant's stock price surged as much as 43% in a single day, boosting its market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, as investors banked on years of rapid revenue growth. AI companies are "priced close to perfection," but their valuations also reflect a "continued escalation of earning estimates that I don't think are going to slow down, frankly," Schiffer said. "I think there's more to come." Schiffer, who has 18-year-old twins, said young people face a "more difficult" backdrop than previous generations between political divisions, wars, an affordability crisis, and AI-fueled job losses. He advised them to figure out their strengths and apply them to activities that are "profoundly human," where people maintain an advantage over AI. He gave the examples of healthcare and enterprise sales, where trust and relationships are vital. Schiffer also recommended they "get fluent with AI — learn how to master it, write it, work it." He added that "people are not going away," and knowing how to work with AI will benefit many industries for years. Shiffer also offered some advice for wealthy parents on not raising entitled children. "Do not give your money to your kids," he said. "That is not the move — it will not serve them or help them create agency, develop their own future, build their own security, or make things happen on their own." For those children who receive large sums from their parents, Schiffer urged long-term responsibility over frivolous spending. "That's a great gift, something you want to steward and manage and help to grow," he said. Jump to

Title: Football Manager player numbers are through the roof thanks to subscription platforms like Game Pass and Netflix - series boss Miles Jacobson explains how

"We don't see cannibalisation..." "It was five, six years ago we celebrated two million players for the first time," Miles Jacobson tells me, during our lengthy interview with the studio head at Football Manager developer Sports Interactive's office earlier this summer. Checking that reference, it was indeed 2020 when the studio first announced that figure, with some pride. "And then we've really embraced the subscription platforms…" Those platforms - Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus, Apple Arcade, Netflix and more - have had a marked effect on the series. From 2 million players in 2020, the series' playerbase has skyrocketed. "As I sit here today," Jacobson says, in the late summer, "and because I haven't been on social media these numbers haven't been [publicly] updated for a long time, so I'm glad you're sitting down - as of when I last checked, we're at 19.09 million players. Of which, 7.5 million have played for more than five hours. If you play a game for more than five hours, you tend to play for a lot longer." Of those, 2 million people played the game in the month of June alone, Jacobson goes on. "That's for a game that has been out since November 2023." While going through the figures, Jacobson brings up a dashboard on the giant screen he has in his office. Total playtime: 1.7bn hours, for FM24 alone. Average playtime: 118.8 hours, "including all the people that have subscribed and played for an hour and then not come back." Without those, that figure's in the many hundreds. And then the one that stood out the most to me: FM24, as of late this summer, actually had slightly more regular daily players than when it first came out. Two years after release, with no FM25 after that game's shock cancellation and no additional, official updates or data patches to fill the gap, FM24 is effectively bigger than it's ever been. "We have nine times as many players; we have two and a half times the revenue," Jacobson says, before adding quite understandably: "So we're really happy with the partnerships." Those kinds of partnerships have been in the spotlight of late. Back in July, for instance, Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio called Game Pass the "elephant in the room" of the conversation around Xbox parent company Microsoft's large-scale layoffs. He referred to it then as an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit." He added, "I don't think it can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up." The sentiment has some backing - in a continued conversation on X with Michael Douse, director of publishing at Baldur's Gate 3 studio Larian, who broadly echoed those points, Colantonio continued: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does." It all makes for interesting context for Football Manager's huge success, something Jacobson attributes quite directly to subscriptions. FM is a relatively unique series of course, in that it's annualised, has theoretically different audience to 'core' games, and is available on such a wide array of platforms, from PC and consoles to tablets and mobile. Nevertheless, Jacobson says there are specific things the studio has done to ensure its success on subscription services. "We built a whole business model around it," he says. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place." Part of that strategy is in building up what Jacobson called a "long-term addressable audience". In other words: those players who play the game for more than five hours. Essentially they become a kind of insurance against subscription revenue suddenly going away. "If the platforms decided they didn't want us anymore, we would know that we have a lot more consumers to talk to," Jacobson explains. As for that revenue, the specifics of the deals these kinds of platforms make with publishers and developers are quite heavily guarded, but Jacobson could speak broadly to how that worked - how, for instance, does getting nine times more players in a game like Football Manager equate to 2.5 times the revenue, when the games don't include any real in-game microtransactions for those extra players to spend on? "Different platforms work in different ways," he says. "Some of them work in a world of up-front fees and royalties. Some of them work in a way of royalties. Those royalties are different for different platforms, so some are based on eyeballs, some are based on playtimes… So what Epic does with their free weeks is very different to what Microsoft does with Game Pass, very different to what Apple Arcade does. Which is very different to what Amazon Prime Days do, which is very different to what Netflix does." An extra upside comes "if your sales don't drop," Jacobson adds, meaning a studio such as Sports Interactive gets the revenue from the royalties and revenue from sales of the games they would've always had. "We don't see cannibalisation, which is an absolute key thing. But we work with a publisher that we've worked with for a long time, who happens to own us as well, who understands the nature of annual iterations." The studio also has a five-year plan, Jacobson says, and publisher Sega its own 10-year plans, which factor in the timing for when certain deals might run out. "We know when our deals are going to run out with these platforms," Jacobson says. "If we can get a deal that makes sense for us, then we will do the deal that makes sense. If we don't… we know how many customers have played for more than five hours, so we know what our target number is going to be to hit that year. So it actually helps us, being able to be in a - I can't say fully 'no-lose' situation - but in most cases we're in a no-lose situation." All that has left Jacobson almost unanimously positive about the services, at least in terms of how they've worked for Football Manager. "We'd love to stay with the partners, we work very, very well together, and it's massively increased our audience - but I don't control their businesses, and with any large business they can pivot, so we've protected ourselves from that, and that's why it was so important to do that long-term plan first." As for that painfully protracted wave of layoffs, Jacobson put much of the industry's difficulty down to games' increasing competition for attention: "We are in the middle of a battle for eyeballs." "We are not just battling time for other games," he adds. "We're also battling for the time of people watching TV, people watching YouTube, music, videos - games are battling with streamers over eyeballs, because there's only one set of eyeballs. It all ties into the same thing… you have games like ours that have huge playtime. You have games like Candy Crush or Clash Royale, but also games like Destiny that have huge, huge playtimes, and we've seen a lot more of those coming through." All of those games, he goes on, "are battling against everything else. Plus there are more games coming out now than there've ever been before. Literally thousands of games coming out each month. Not everything can survive. So the subscription platforms are part of it, but the whole market is part of it as well." Likewise, he adds, "you have to be realistic about the situation, which is: if there aren't enough hours in the day for the games to be played, then there are games that aren't going to be able to be made. That's the reality, in my opinion, of what people have been going through the last few years… I think people probably realised there's just too many games coming out, they can't all be successful. And the budgets have gone up so much - budgets have gone up exponentially - so you have to sell a lot more than you had to sell five years ago to have a hit game. So it's a perfect storm." That ultimately comes back to Jacobson and the team's five- and ten-year plans - something which might insulate Football Manager as a series more than other games from the "infinite money" concerns raised above. "We've got my COO, we've got the comms team, we've got the finance team, we've got the BI team, and we've got the whole of Sega that we worked with to agree on that long-term plan," Jacobson says. "And then I ruined it all by not releasing FM25."

Title: Bitcoin’s 25% Shot at $125K This Month Sends Traders Flocking to Bitcoin Hyper Presale
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/btc-25-chance-to-reach-125k-bitcoin-hyper-gains-interest/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Polymarket bettors have predicted a 25% chance for Bitcoin ($BTC) to rise above $125K this month. It’s currently down to 17% at the time of writing. Earlier today, Bitcoin touched an intraday high of $117,888, bringing it closer in line with bettors’ predictions. The coin reached its all-time high of $124,517 on 14 August 2025, placing it only 6.1% below its ATH. Despite a 2.6% increase in Bitcoin’s price last month, crossing $125K will depend on sustained momentum fuelled by improving macro conditions and strong ETF inflows. Underscoring this bullish setup, Bitwise’s Matt Hogan said this in an interview with CNBC two months ago: The Bitcoin network only produces 450 Bitcoin per day. Yesterday alone, Bitcoin ETFs bought 10,000 Bitcoin. This institutional investment into Bitcoin is a one-time event, it’s going to take years to play out, but I think over the course of the year, there’s going to be this persistent bit where there’s more demand than there is supply. And the natural response to that is […] Bitcoin’s price goes higher. —Matt Hougan, CNBC Interview As $BTC continues to build momentum, its Q4 looks promising, with bettors giving a 79% chance of hitting $125K+ by year-end. This growing confidence hasn’t just lifted $BTC sentiment, it’s spilling over new Bitcoin-based projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has raised 16.8M in its presale. The market sentiment is very bullish right now as $BTCgets closer to breaking a new ATH — $125K. While Polymarket suggests that an upside is more likely than a downside, macroeconomic factors such as ETF inflows and Fed cuts in Q4 will have a direct impact on Bitcoin’s price action in the coming weeks and months. In other developments, US spot $BTC ETFs are seeing robust inflows. For starters, the last week saw approximately $2.3B pouring in from prominent names like BlackRock and Fidelity. As the $BTC held in ETFs and treasury hands reduces circulating supply, it makes $BTC scarcer, potentially leading to prices hikes in the future. Furthermore, some crypto analysts highlight several historic timing markers for Bitcoin, such as the 1,065-day post-halving window. Historically, bullish markets have often witnessed parabolic surges around the post-halving timeframe, suggesting that the current setup paves the path for $BTC’s strongest rally yet. With the interest rate cuts, regulatory clarity, increased institutional inflows, and shifting risk perceptions, newer $BTC-backed top altcoins are benefiting from this halo effect. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a high-throughput project built to supercharge Bitcoin’s scalability, is drawing strong investor interest as it rides the $BTC’s bullish wave. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) offers Solana speed + $ETH liquidity + $BTC security, unlocking a true high-throughput Layer-2. It will enable instant payments, DeFi, dApps, and MemeFi within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Other exclusive (upcoming) features include: Additionally, the token’s dual-chain utility enhances hedging, liquidity strategies, and governance rights, positioning it as a high-value play in the 2025 market. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is already flexing serious strength, having raised $16.8M so far, with the next price hike expected in less than 2 days. At today’s presale rate of $0.012945 per $HYPER, a $200 buy bags you roughly 15,450 tokens. But here’s the juicier bit — you can scoop staking rewards at 68% APY if you buy now. That means the same $200 allocation into $HYPER could climb to around $537 by 2025’s end once you add staking yield to the price appreciation. Remember that the staking APY will decrease as more traders stake tokens. The earlier you buy, the higher an APY you’ll benefit from. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide here. With whales already aping in — including buys of $161.3K and $100.6K in August, $HYPER is shaping up as a rare Layer-2 gem that blends scalability, utility, and fat staking yields with Bitcoin’s unmatched security. Snag $HYPER at lower-tier prices before the next hike. This is not financial advice. Please do your own research before investing in cryptocurrencies.

Title: Apple’s iPhone 17, Air go on sale to years of demand for new look

Friday, 19 Sep 2025 A customer looks at Apple's iPhone 17 series at the company's Sanlitun store during the first day of sales of the smartphones in Beijing, China, on Sept 19, 2025. — Bloomberg For the past four years, some Apple Inc customers have been waiting for a fresh design before buying a new iPhone. The time has come for those consumers, with the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max and iPhone Air going on sale Sept 19. In a first since 2020, Apple is rolling out several new iPhone designs. It’s also releasing into stores a new Apple Watch SE, Watch Series 11, Watch Ultra 3 and AirPods Pro 3. Early sales across Asia showed strong demand for the Pro models. In Hong Kong, a small crowd assembled at Apple’s flagship store to check out the new handsets, but stock for walk-in purchases was limited only to the novel iPhone Air. Anyone wanting to purchase an iPhone 17 or Pro edition was directed to order online, where Apple indicated wait times of roughly three weeks. Australia, New Zealand, mainland China and Singapore’s Apple stores showed similar shipping times, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max wait extending to as long as four weeks. Japan was the only major market where consumers could acquire any new iPhone model with next-day delivery, while in South Korea the 17 Pro was available within a week whereas the Pro Max was marked as unavailable until late October. The new Pro editions return the iPhone to an aluminum shell and have a redesigned back, while the iPhone Air is Apple’s first attempt at a radically different design with its thin shape as the main selling point. The stakes are high for Apple. The company faces high expectations from Wall Street for sales over the holiday period, despite global economic concerns and the threat of future price increases due to tariffs. The Cupertino, California-based electronics giant is also trying to convince consumers its mojo is back after its artificial intelligence strategy fell flat. The new models’ reception in China will be of great importance to the company. Sales in the region fell 6% in the weeks leading up to the new device family launch, marking a steeper-than-usual slump. After years of success in the region over the past decade, Apple now only holds 12% of the local market, trailing Oppo, Huawei Technologies Co, Xiaomi Corp and others. The launch of its latest major iteration of the iPhone – a product that debuted in 2007 – hits as Meta Platforms Inc and others are moving on to AI-powered wearables, including smart glasses with displays. The new models also land weeks after Alphabet Inc’s Google and Samsung Electronics Co rolled out upgrades to their flagship smartphones. Samsung, in particular, is a threat to the iPhone’s dominance. It launched a seventh-generation version of its book-style foldable phone, which appears to be a hit with consumers due to its more durable frame and thinner look. Apple won’t have a foldable phone until the end of next year, Bloomberg News has reported. The iPhone 17 Pro line is resonating most with buyers because it improves the features that people most want in a new phone: battery life, camera technology and durability. It’s also priced from US$1,099 (from RM5,499 in Malaysia), only US$100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro it replaces. "Prices are being really increased for the first time in several years, so if we see a typical replacement cycle with higher prices, plus some progress on AI, that may not be an exciting setup for the stock, but it’s a decent one,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which has US$33bil (RM138.92bil) in assets under management. The iPhone Air, on the other hand, may not drive sales despite the attention it will receive. The US$999 device focuses on a thin profile, but has drawbacks in battery life, audio and cameras. It’s also the same price as a 17 Pro when factoring in an optional magnetic battery attachment to increase endurance. Earlier this year, Samsung launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, using a similar concept to Apple’s iPhone Air. Thus far, it’s been a sales dud. – Bloomberg Thank you for your report!

Title: Indian Bonds Ripe For Rally On Foreign Inflows, BlackRock Says

Indian bonds present an attractive opportunity for foreign investors after a bruising selloff, according to a BlackRock Inc. product strategist. The spread between 10-year debt of India versus the US is near its widest level year-to-date and there’s potential for a reversal, Koay Hui Sien, BlackRock’s head of iShares fixed-income product strategy for APAC ex-Japan, said in an email interview. A rare sovereign rating upgrade last month helps make Indian bonds appealing, she added. “The setup favors renewed foreign inflows,” Koay said, particularly with the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-cut path into year-end. The Fed reduced rates on Wednesday and signaled more might come this year, which makes debt of other countries more attractive by comparison. Global funds are starting to return after months of subdued international appetite amid tariff-related worries. Foreign purchases of index-eligible Indian bonds hit 104 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in August, the highest since March — even as yields on India’s 10-year notes rose 19 basis points, the sharpest monthly advance in three years. India’s domestic-driven growth and low dependence on US exports boost its appeal in such an environment, according to Koay. Indian bonds also offer good potential for roll-down return — price gains made as they approach maturity — and that the currently low levels of foreign ownership leave plenty of room for a catch-up trade, Koay said. However, there are still concerns, including the rally in yields last month. On a hedged basis, Indian bonds are underperforming global peers with a 3% gain this year. And worries over heavy supply of longer-duration bonds linger. But that also means “a clear pickup over Asian peers” and with lower volatility, Koay said. Indian 10-year government bonds yield around 6.5%, compared with about 6.2% in Indonesia and 5.9% in Thailand. BlackRock launched its India government bond exchange traded fund in February 2024, four months before the country’s debt was included in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s flagship emerging market index. Foreign holdings of index-eligible notes have risen by more than a trillion rupees since then.

Title: Artists are losing work, wages, and hope as bosses and clients embrace AI

After the launch of ChatGPT sparked the generative AI boom in Silicon Valley in late 2022, it was mere months before OpenAI turned to selling the software as an automation product for businesses. (It was first called Team, then Enterprise.) And it wasn’t long after that before it became clear that the jobs managers were likeliest to automate successfully weren’t the dull, dirty, and dangerous ones that futurists might have hoped: It was, largely, creative work that companies set their sights on. After all, enterprise clients soon realized that the output of most AI systems was too unreliable and too frequently incorrect to be counted on for jobs that demand accuracy. But creative work was another story. As a result, some of the workers that have been most impacted by clients and bosses embracing AI have been in creative fields like art, graphic design, and illustration. Since the LLMs trained and sold by tech companies have ingested countless illustrations, photos, and works of art (without the artists’ permission), AI products offered by Midjourney, OpenAI, and Google can recreate images and designs tailored to a clients’ needs at rates much cheaper than hiring a human artist. The work will necessarily not be original, and as of now it’s not legal to copyright AI-generated art, but in many contexts, a corporate client will deem it passable—especially for its non-public-facing needs. This is why you’ll hear artists talk about the “good enough” principle. Creative workers aren’t typically worried that AI systems are so good they’ll be rendered obsolete as artists, or that AI-generated work will be better than theirs. Their fear is that clients, managers, and even consumers will deem AI art “good enough” as the companies that produce it push down their wages and corrode their ability to earn a living. (There is a clear parallel to the Luddites here, who were skilled technicians and clothmakers who weren’t worried about technology surpassing their skill, but the way factory owners used it to make cheaper, lower-quality goods that drove down prices.) Sadly, this seems to be exactly what’s been happening, at least according to the available anecdata. I’ve received so many stories from artists about declining work offers, disappearing clients, and gigs drying up altogether, that it’s clear a change is afoot, and that many artists, illustrators, and graphic designers have seen their livelihoods impacted for the worse. And it’s not just wages. Corporate AI products are inflicting an assault on visual arts workers’ sense of identity and self-worth, as well as their material stability. As with translators, the subject of the last installment of AI Killed My Job, there’s a widespread sense that AI companies are undermining a crucial pillar of what makes us human; our capacity to create and share art. Some of these stories, I will warn you, are very hard to read—to the extent that this is a content warning for descriptions of suicidal ideation. All, I think, help us better understand how AI is impacting the arts and the visual arts industry. A sincere thanks to everyone who wrote in and shared their stories. “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing,” as the from SF author Joanna Maciejewska memorably put it, “not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” These stories show what happens when it’s the other way around. A quick note before we proceed: Soliciting, curating, and editing these stories, as well as producing them, is a time-consuming endeavor. I can only do this work thanks to readers who chip in $6 a month, or $60 a year—the cost of a decent cup of coffee, or a coffee table book, respectively. If you find value in it, and you’re able, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription. I would love to expand the scope and reach of this work. Many thanks, and onward. Edited by Mike Pearl. ﻿I work in the field of constructing costumes for live entertainment: theater, film/TV, ballet/opera, touring performers, etc. Budget and scale is all over the map, from low-budget storefront theater in which one person designs and secures costumes for a production, up to a big-budget Broadway spectacular, which can have a dozen people on the design team alone and literally hundreds of makers creating the costumes from designs developed by the design team. I’m seeing this happen typically on the low-budget to midrange end—community theater/high school theater, independent film, etc.: Producers and directors eliminating the position of costume designer in favor of AI image generation. It comes up often in professional forums in the field, someone will share the AI generated costume “designs” and they will be literally impossible to construct for an actual human with materials available in the actual world—gravity-defying materials on pornographically cartoon bodies, etc. -Rachel E. Pollock I remember reading about the new stage of generative AI engines sometime in late 2022 in the NY Times, and seeing Dall-E and Midjourney's outputs and knowing it will mean trouble. Until then AI was making laughable 'art.' Really bad stuff. But all of a sudden the engines had leveled up. I have been working in the comics and publishing industry for over 20 years, but the majority of my income was usually coming from work with advertising agencies. Whenever they needed to present an idea to a client I would come in and help with illustrations, and sometimes storyboards, this was all internal and would never be published, but it was still great to get paid for doing what I love most—drawing. I felt appreciated for my skills and liked working with other people. It was in 2023 that It seemed like overnight all those jobs disappeared. On one of my very last jobs I was asked to make an illustrated version of an AI generated image, after that, radio silence. I had my suspicions that AI was the culprit, but could not know for sure, there was also a general downturn in the advertising industry at the time. Finally I reached out to one of the art directors I work with and he confirmed that the creatives are using AI like crazy, there was no aspect of shame in presenting an AI illustration internally, no one would call you out on it, and it's sure as hell cheaper than using an illustrator. I had to deal with a sudden, very scary decrease in income. Meanwhile it felt like AI slop was mocking me from every corner of the internet, and every big company was promoting their new AI assistant. I was just disgusted with all these corporations jumping on the AI bandwagon not thinking of what the outcomes could be. and additionally, there was the insult of knowing that the engines were trained on working illustrators, including mine! I used my free time to work on a new graphic novel, and eventually leaned into more comics work, which paid (a lot) less, but at least felt more creatively satisfying. The two years following the loss of work were difficult, definitely felt like the rug was taken out from under my feet, and I'm still adjusting to the new landscape, although I feel better about where I am now, I work harder than ever before, for less money. But at least the work will be seen by readers. I'm hoping that in the world of comics the public shame of replacing an artist with AI will hold off the use of the technology, but I'm sure that one day it will become a lot more accepted. I feel like we live in an age where technological changes are happening too rapidly, and are not in any way reined in by the government, and humans can lose their job in the drop of a hat, with no sense of security or help. We are just not built for these fast changes. I'm happy to see people sobering up to the downside of this technology, and hoping the hype would die down soon. -Anonymous I've been out of work for a while now. I made children's book illustrations, stock art, and took various art commissions. Now I have several maxed out credit cards and use a donation bin for food. I haven't had a steady contract in over a year. two weeks ago, when a client who has switched to AI found out about this he gave me $50 out of "a sense of guilt." Basically pity for the fact that Illustrator, as a job, does not exist anymore. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore.The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. I feel cheated, like if I could go back in time and tell the younger me in high school that all the practice, all the love, and all the hope from your parents and friends for your future gets you is carpal tunnel and poverty, I could have gone into a better job field. I'd be an electrician or welder. I have a resume with skills that are appealing to no one, as slop can be generated for free. I sold my colored pencils and markers and illustration tablet on Facebook marketplace for a steal once a previous client who I considered a friend boasted on LinkedIn that AI was the future of cost reduction above an image of a man in a suit who looked like him with six fingers holding a wad of cash. I have applied to over one thousand jobs and I stopped keeping track. My disability didn’t effect making art, but makes me a poor candidate for much else. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore. The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. My friends all post themselves as cartoons online. The person I married had a secret file on their computer labeled "AI pics" they thought I didn't notice. I will wither away eating stale food from the garbage while everyone else is complacent with the slop generator doing what I used to put passion into and finely detail. I don't think it's going to get better. -Anonymous1 I have taught various graphic courses but overwhelmingly Photoshop, the 800 lb. gorilla of the graphics world. I am not a photographer and I do not teach people to take photos, but to manipulate them, also known as Photo Imaging. They are done by manually placing several images into a composite, and then enhancing them by various digital techniques such as layering, blending, masking etc. to arrive at a final result. Most people who take my classes don’t necessarily want to do all that I do, but want to know how to correct or otherwise manipulate photos to create their own projects. I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence and Photoshop’s version, Firefly, my teaching and private tutoring have pretty much dropped dead. There is very little incentive for people to learn these techniques when they can conjure up an image by text prompts. It takes virtually no skill to do this besides the ability to read and write. I have played around with A.I. for personal projects, with varying degrees of success. Some of it is amazing, and some of it is laughable. However, there is no escaping the reality that these models were trained on existing artwork already online. It’s essentially plagiarism on steroids. Also known as theft. Not to mention the obscene energy costs involved. Had this happened to me 20 years ago I would have been devastated. But at this point in my life (I’m 71) it is not as important as it once was. I’ve had some success both in client work and also creating digital art pieces for which I’ve won accolades. I’ve found satisfaction in teaching but now I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. I have been married over 50 years and we have never relied on my income to survive. -Susan Oakes I worked in the video game industry, as a 3D artist. In early 2023, when AI image generation was hitting the mainstream, I was working as a temporary contractor at a large games and technology company. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there.” I have not been able to find any work since then. Our boss was very enthusiastic about AI image generation, and he showed us how he was using AI to generate some of the textures for the game. I realized that if AI image generation didn't exist, then the company would have needed to hire an extra artist to do that work. I could have recommended a dozen colleagues who were looking for work at the time. It felt like AI was directly taking money out of artist's pockets, and allowing the companies to keep it all. When my contract with that company ended, I did an exit interview with my boss. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there." I have not been able to find any work since then. There were several factors as to why there were so many layoffs in games and technology in 2023-2024, but I know that AI has played a role. I miss working as a 3D artist. -Anonymous I am a freelance 3D/2D Generalist. Over the past decade plus, I've had a recurring gig of being hired as a contractor to help create supplemental graphics and B-roll for various documentary-style programs. Everything from infographics about military tanks to 3D animations of prehistoric creatures to recreations of scenes involving historical figures. If you've ever watched any History show, you know the format: footage of the host and experts speaking, then sometimes video clips or photographs, and then typically animated content that illustrates the points the speaker is making. That final category was, until recently, made by people like me. That market has completely dried up. My job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. A couple of years ago, as soon as demos of AI-generated video began to appear, there were almost immediate rumblings that the specific business of creating documentary-style graphics would be disrupted. The logic being that, while the public might reject a feature-length AI-slop theatrical film, the at-home audience for shows about military history or ghosts or aliens might be less-discerning. That theory is now being tested. History Channel is currently airing a season of "Life After People" that heavily features AI-generated visuals, and I'm sure there are more shows in the pipeline being made the same way. We'll see how audiences respond. As much as I would like to say viewers will reject the AI style and demand a return to human-made art, I'm not convinced it will happen. Even if it did, it might soon be too late to turn back. I know that there are studios with expert producers, writers, and showrunners with decades of experience in this exact genre who are closing their doors. That institutional knowledge will be gone. That's probably the bigger point: this trend is not only affecting artists like me, but also the types of companies I contract for. Obviously I lament my own loss of those stable gigs, but my job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. -Anonymous I work as a freelance illustrator (focusing on comics and graphic novels but also doing book covers or whatever else might come my way) and as a "day job" I do pre-press graphic design work for a screen printing and embroidery company in Seattle. Because of our location, we handle large orders (sometimes 10k shirts at a time) for corporate clients—including some of the biggest companies in the world (Microsoft, Amazon, MLB, NHL, etc.) and my job is to create client proofs where I mock up the art on the garment and call out PMS colors as applicable. I also do the color separations to prepare the art file for screen printing. [H]e instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. When AI first came on the scene, I was approached by a potential client that was self-funding a mobile game and wanted to commission me to create in-game art. He asked what my standard rate was and then offered to double it if I allowed him to pay in etherium (which I knew nothing about at that point.) I immediately had some concerns, but I'm a struggling artist so I took the gig anyway and crossed my fingers. He then introduced me to generative AI and encouraged me to use it to create game content quickly. At first I was interested in the possibility of using it to reduce my workload by maybe generating simple elements I get tired of painting—like grasses or leaves—but he instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. After that I resisted and tried to use my own art. He grew frustrated with me pretty quickly and I left the company after less than 2 weeks (I was never paid; he owes/owed me about $1300).` Since then, I have been very outspoken against generative AI and haven't touched it again. I was the moderator for a very large group of children's book illustrators (250k members) and I helped institute and enforce a strict AI ban within the group. While this was mostly a positive thing, there were quite a few occasions where legitimate artists were targeted for harassment over accusations of AI use. Some of them were even driven out of the group, in spite of our interventions and assurances that the person was not using AI. In my own freelancing work, I have now been accused of using AI as well. I like to do fan art from Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern [series], and sometimes when I'm looking for work I will post my art and past commissions in fan groups to see if anyone wants to hire me to draw their original characters based on the Pern books. Almost invariably now someone will ask if my art is AI generated. It used to bother me more than it does now, I'm growing a little numb to it. My coworker at my screen printing job (in spite of knowing my negative feelings on the matter because I had cried after I found several dozen pieces of my art in the LAION dataset) chose to plug my art into an AI generator and asked for it to imitate my style—which it did poorly, might I add. It felt extremely violating. Lastly, in my role as a graphic designer, we often now have to deal with clients sending art files in for screen printing that were generated with AI. It's a pain in the ass because these files are often low-resolution and the weird smudgy edges in most AI images don't make for easy color separations. When a human graphic designer sits down to create a design, they typically leave layers in place that can be individually manipulated and that makes my job much easier. AI flattens everything so I have to manually separate out design elements if I want to independently adjust anything. The text is still frequently garbled or unreadable. The fonts don't actually exist so they can't easily be matched. These clients are also almost invariably cheap, and get upset when they're told that it's going to be a $75 per hr art charge to fix the image so it's suitable for screening. Also, and here I don't have any data, just my personal anecdotal experience, but it feels like some of these companies have laid off so much of their in-house graphic design staff that they are increasingly reliant on us as a print service to fix up stuff they'd formerly done for themselves. I get simple graphic design requests every day by people who should have had the resources to handle this themselves but now they're expecting me to pick up the slack for the employees they've let go for the sake of our working relationship and keeping them on as clients. It's become such a drag on our small business that my boss is considering extra fees. (Which, considering the slim margins in the garment industry, is really saying something!) I am convinced Microsoft does not have any in-house graphic designers left at this point. Okay I joke, but man, it's bleak. I have no way of knowing how many gigs I've lost to AI, since it's hard to prove a negative. I'm not significantly less busy than I was before, and my income hasn't really changed for better or worse. There's more stress and fear, greater workloads cleaning up badly-done AI-generated images on behalf of people looking for a quick fix, instead of getting to do my own creative stuff. And it felt deeply and profoundly cruel to have my life's work trained on without my consent, and then put to use creating images like deepfakes or child sexual abuse materials. That one was really hard for me as a mom. I'd rather cut my own heart out than contribute to something like that. There's a part of me that will never forgive the tech industry for what they've taken from me and what they've chosen to do with it. In the early days as the dawning horror set in, I cried about this almost every day. I wondered if I should quit making art. I contemplated suicide. I did nothing to these people, but every day I have to see them gleefully cheer online about the anticipated death of my chosen profession. I had no idea we artists were so hated—I still don't know why. What did my silly little cat drawings do to earn so much contempt? That part is probably one of the hardest consequences of AI to come to terms with. It didn't just try to take my job (or succeed in making my job worse) it exposed a whole lot of people who hate me and everything I am for reasons I can't fathom. They want to exploit me and see me eradicated at the same time. -Melissa I’m a South African illustrator and designer with 20 years of experience, and in my industry, I saw things going pear-shaped even before gen AI hit the scene. One the main places I get jobs from is on Upwork (one of those gig type work platforms), and I’ve noticed a couple of things: A decrease in job offerings for the illustration I typically do (like book covers). I’ve also noticed a lot more job offers to “fix” an AI generated cover. These authors offer less money because of “the work is pretty much done” attitude. Since Upwork added an AI function to help potential employers write their briefs, there’s been a surge in what I’m pretty sure are fake jobs. The job listings all sound very samey obviously because of the format the ai uses, and the employers have no history on the platform of ever having hired anyone and don’t have their phone or bank linked. So I think what might be happening is that some evil person/persons are creating fake accounts and posting fake jobs so that their competitors waste credits applying for these jobs. -Roxane Lapa I got my start on deviantart, moved on to furaffinity and various other websites. I used to take commissions in the furry fandom drawing futa furries with big fat tits and dicks. In the past year or two my commissions have all but dried up, in the time it can take me to do the lineart for an anthropomorphic quokka's foreskin, someone can just go onto one of a dozen websites and knock something of tolerable quality out in no time at all. AI has ruined a once sacred artform. -Anonymous I am the creative team manager for an e-commerce based company. I manage the projects of 2 videographers, 1 CG artist and 3 graphic designers (including myself).As AI has been getting more and more advanced, our boss (one of the owners) keeps pushing us to use AI to make our images stand out amongst competitors. We have a limited budget, so filming or photographing our products in real environments is difficult. And photoshopping them into stock imagery also takes time. Apparently a 1-hour turn around time per image is not quick enough. Our boss has been going to conferences where he hears and sees nothing but praise for AI created images. How quick it is and how "good" the images look like.So of course he's been pushing us to use this technology. I did tell him that it's going to be a learning curve and to be patient. From Midjourney, to the latest update of Chat GPT, and to Adobe's Firefly. We've been cranking out these partial AI images. The funny part is, A LOT of it still has to be photoshopped together. AI is still not smart enough (yet) to produce accurate images. The products we sell are very particular and even if you feed the AI images of said product, it never gets it 100% right.Our boss didn't believe us so he himself tried it and failed miserably. Despite that, he still reminds us that our jobs will be obsolete and that we have to adapt.Even since we started using AI to improve our images, the turnaround time for listing images remains the same. Though I feel like our boss is waiting for the day to fire and replace my team with AI. -Anonymous As an artist, I thought I was going crazy when it seemed everyone was okay (even enthusiastic) with our work being scraped left and right to build image-generation models. I'm a mom and have a mortgage to pay, so the existential threat to my livelihood caused a lot of sleepless nights to say the least. I have been working in 2D animation for the last 10 years. I'm a background artist, which is unfortunately one of the departments most likely to be hit by gen AI replacement in the animation production pipeline. Of course, there's no reality where gen AI could actually do my job properly as it requires a ton of attention to detail. Things need to be drawn at the correct scale across hundreds of scenes. In many cases scenes directly hook up to each other, so details need to stay consistent—not to mention be layered correctly. But these are things that an exec typically glosses over in the name of productivity gains. Plus, there's already a precedent in which AI was used to produce backgrounds for a Netflix anime. Thankfully, I'm very lucky to work at an artist-run studio that currently appears to avoid the use of AI, so I continue to be employed. My peers who were freelance illustrators or concept artists are not so lucky. I'd say about half of the people I've worked alongside this last decade have left the field (not all because of AI, granted, but the state of the North American animation/games industry is a whole thing right now and AI is not helping). The production I am on currently leverages a lot of stock photos from Adobe Stock. We have a rule in place not to use AI, but some images slip through the cracks. These have to be removed from the finished product because of, I assume, the inability to copyright AI-generated images. An incident happened recently where an AI image almost made it to the very end of the pipeline undetected and wound up disrupting several departments who are on tight submission deadlines. We aren't typically paid overtime unless approved by the studio beforehand, so it's likely that unpaid labor (or ghost hours, where you don't tell anyone you worked overtime) went into fixing this mess AI created. I was running research on [Adobe’s] stock marketplace, trying to understand how customers were adopting the new Gen A.I. tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. Internally Adobe was launching their own text-to-image A.I. generator called Firefly but it hadn’t been announced. I was on the betas for Firefly and Generative Fill (GenFill) for Photoshop and ran workshops with designers on the Firefly team. I tested the new tooling internally and gave feedback on Adobe Slack channels and their ethics committee. A.I. generated content started to flood the Adobe Stock website as stock contributors quickly switched from adding and uploading photos to prompting and creating assets with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly and then selling them back on Adobe Stock. Users wanted a better search experience but it was never explicitly clear if they wanted more A.I. slop, although Reddit forums indicated otherwise. During the GenFill beta, I raised concerns about model bias after prompting the model to edit an image of then president Joe Biden across racial categories and having the model return a Black man with cornrows—without taking into account relevant and contextual surrounding information in the image. The ethics committee pointed me to a boilerplate Word doc with their guiding principles and we had a short Microsoft Teams call, but there wasn’t any real concern from their end. After raising additional red flags inside an Adobe Slack channel about Photoshop’s GenFill beta possibly being used to create misinformation at scale the main response I got was a blasé “Photoshop, making misinformation since 1990…” Long story long, the people internally working on these products really don’t care. In another company all hands meeting about text-to-vector capabilities fellow workers shared thoughts and concerns on the impact of AI tooling to the livelihoods of artists, illustrators and other designers in the Teams chat and no one cared. In another meeting when asked about artist’s rights a manager quipped “In the research from AdobeMAX (Adobe’s annual conference) someone said they were willing to sell their ‘artistic style’ for around the price of a car” when gathering data around AI-style mimicry and trust. The Firefly model still struggled to render hands and certain objects with difficulty and an Adobe company wide email sent to all employees encouraged us to sign up for an upcoming photoshoot on a green screen, holding things like trumpets, accordions, rubber chickens and asked employees to make awkward expressions like being surprised with “mouth open” or squinting while putting your finger in your ear in exchange for a free lunch. Some time in 2023 Adobe paid for photographers to document crowds of people during a concert in Seattle and had attendees sign waivers releasing their likeness since Firefly had trouble rendering and distinguishing people in crowds. Shortly thereafter I was told my staff role was being eliminated. They didn’t let me switch teams. They gave me six weeks to find a new job inside the company and six weeks of severance pay. During the six weeks of “offboarding” as they called it I applied to dozens of internal jobs at Frame.io and other teams like Acrobat within the company and it never went anywhere. -Anonymous I just graduated in June from a two-year intensive vocational program in graphic design. It's probably still too early in my job search for me to say that AI "killed my job," but my classmates and I, as well as students from the class just ahead of us, are certainly struggling to find work. Why I wanted to reach out, though, is to share what my experience was as a student studying design in the midst of the peak years of this AI hype. Basically our entire second-year curriculum in one of our five classes, which was previously focused on UX, UI, web design, etc, transitioned to being largely generative AI-focused. I don't think I'm overstating matters to say that no one in my class was happy about this; none of us decided to go (back) to school for design to learn Midjourney or Runway. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? [One instructor] has lived through and had his career significantly impacted by past shifts in the industry (he was a full-time web designer when platforms like Squarespace came along), so my charitable read is that he wants to prepare us for a lifetime of learning new tools to stay employable. I think the faculty in our program are also hearing from alumni and their technical advisory board that AI tools are becoming more important for local companies (we live in a pretty tech-centric city). So while he's sympathetic, I guess, he's still choosing to go all-in on AI, and to push his students to do the same. In our other classes, AI use was varied. Some of our instructors allowed it; a couple still forbid it completely. I came out of school feeling like... I guess I'm grateful to know what's out there, for the sake of my own employability in this really awful job market. I really feel for designers whose school days are a little further behind them. It's not just AI that makes me say this—in fact, even if things like image and video generators find a more permanent place in graphic arts careers, they're changing fast enough that whatever we learned in school is likely to be outdated pretty quickly. If all the angry posts I see on LinkedIn from more senior designers are any indication, there's been a trend in hiring for a while of companies looking for a designer who also does video, animation, UX/UI, and many other things that aren't really graphic design. Our program taught us a lot of those skills, so maybe, if the current economic circumstances improve, our class might be okay. But it makes me worry a lot for our future. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? Even our AI-booster instructor told us over and over again that computers will never replace the need for creative design thinking and empathy. That, he said, is what we should lean into to distinguish ourselves and ensure our employability. But there are only so many positions out there for art directors, and not everyone who studies design wants to do that. Production design gets looked down on as "menial" by some, I think, but it used to be the pipeline into more senior design positions--and if that goes away, how do new designers even get into the field? And what about people who have worked in production their whole lives? -Anonymous I am a freelancer of a few trades, so it can be hard to measure lost work, because I can also wonder if I'm slow because times are slow, or a typical cycle, or AI. I can tell you this: ALL my "lighter" graphic design work—making social media or print ad graphics, designing logos—has totally dried up. I was actually more worried about this when Canva came out, but even then they wanted my eye and my touch on things, so having the tools to do it themselves didn't really deter people from hiring me. I did this kind of work for some local small businesses, organizations, event venues. This was an abrupt change within the past couple years. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" […] are in the bones of the art. My illustration work is mostly picture books, and while my work has remained steady (I do 1-3 a year), the number of inquiries I've gotten from new authors has dropped to nearly zero, when I used to field a few a month and usually book myself out for the next year. Also, through Upwork and other various avenues I find work, I've had quite a few people (presumably authors) reach out to me to "fix" their AI generated art. It does depend on the task at hand but it's a 90% certainty that fixing the art will take nearly as long as just doing it myself. Of course they aren't coming to me with AI generated work because they intended to hire a full-blown illustrator. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" AI makes on art for something like a picture book, which requires consistency of a lot of different elements across at minimum 16 or so pages, are so deep that they are in the bones of the art. It's not airbrushing out a sixth finger; it's making the faux colored pencil look the same across pages, or all the items in a cluttered room be represented consistently from different angles, or make the different characters look like they came from the same universe. It's bad at that stuff and it's not surface level. A lot of time potential clients don't know why the art isn't working and it's because it's these all-encompassing characteristics. -Melissa E. Vandiver The title for this story comes from the heading of the email this author submitted. Hopefully, as the bubble bursts, the quality of these outputs will plateau, and people will realize it was all slop to begin with. It’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with soulless bunch of pixels and even just putting them in the same category. The point of art, no matter the category-even something as simple as corporate illustration, is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can feel the quirks, the struggle and the love in every piece or at the very least the personality of the artist. And that’s what makes art unique and human. No doubt AI art can be beautiful, after all it’s modelled on top of some of the best human art ever produced. But to me, it will always feel like you know when you’re taking a photo of the sunset or the moon with your phone and it never looks right? Those photos never compares to actually standing beneath it and taking the moment in with the sight. Both can impress, sure, but only one is able to make us feel something in our bones. And that’s what AI art will never be able to do for me As a medical transcriptionist, I went through the same story in the early 2000s when speech recognition software became a thing. I went from making good money, to training the speech engines, to being paid a pittance to edit SR-generated text, to leaving the field and having to reinvent myself - at 56. I finally retired because I was making less reviewing medical records full-time as an independent contractor than I would with Social Security, even retiring early. Rapid evolution of technology is more than our society is built to handle. Pursuit of insane profits by releasing iffy tech will destroy us from the bottom up. There are now disclaimers in every medical record to the effect that much of the text of reports is generated by speech engines and ***mistakes should be expected/can occur***. JFC. Oh, sorry the engine said 50 mg instead of 15 mg of drug and your dad died as a result. Whoopsie. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Nvidia announces a new partnership with Intel to work on custom data centers and personal computer products

Nvidia, the world's leading chipmaker, announced on Thursday that it's investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company. Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it “a fusion of two world-class platforms” that combines Intel's strength in making conventional computer chips, known as CPUs, that power most laptops, with Nvidia's focus on the specialized graphics chips that are critical for artificial intelligence. “This partnership is a recognition that computing has fundamentally changed,” Huang told reporters Thursday. “The era of accelerated and AI computing has arrived.” Intel shares jumped nearly 23%, its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1987. Nvidia shares added more than 3%. For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. For personal computer products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology. The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut. Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the AI boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake — 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — making it one of Intel’s biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing. Of Nvidia’s own Intel stake, Huang said “the Trump administration had no involvement in this partnership at all,” though “would have been very supportive, of course.” Intel's stock price surge Thursday pushed the total value of the U.S. government’s stake in Intel to $13.2 billion, a $2.5 billion increase from before Nvidia's announcement. Huang said Nvidia has been in talks with Intel for about a year. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who joined the press call with Huang on Thursday, said he's been talking to Nvidia since he was named Intel's new leader in March. “This is a very big, important milestone,” Tan said. “I call it a game-changing opportunity that we can work together.” The deal is “bullish for U.S. tech,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note. Ives said it brings Intel “front and center into the AI game” and, combined with the U.S. government stake, adds to "a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.” Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the AI boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems. Left out of the celebration Thursday was another U.S. chipmaking rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Shares in the leading maker of both GPUs and CPUs dropped slightly Thursday. AMD, Intel and Nvidia are all headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The deal between Nvidia and Intel comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and China-based Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing. While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors. Huang emphasized Thursday that both his company and Intel remain “very successful customers” of TSMC. Huang has been in Britain on a visit that coincides with Trump’s trip to the country, and he has been attending events with the president along with other Silicon Valley bigwigs. At a signing ceremony for a trans-Atlantic tech partnership on Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump mused that AI was “taking over the world.” “I’m looking at you guys. You’re taking over the world, Jensen,” Trump said. Huang and Trump also both attended a royal banquet, prompting the tech mogul to dish about the Windsor Castle event to Intel's CEO in the seconds before their press event. “The cognac was excellent, but just not enough of it,” Huang told Tan. “I guess the cognac was from 1912.”

Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (NasdaqGS: CRWD). On July 19, 2024, an update pushed by the Company caused global outages for millions of users of Microsoft Windows devices, including financial institutions, airlines, government entities, and corporations, and left users vulnerable to potential hacking threats. Then, on July 22, 2024, it was revealed that Congress had called on CEO George Kurtz to testify regarding the catastrophe, and the Company’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts. Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had retained noted attorney David Boies to seek damages from the Company following the outages. Thereafter, the Company and certain of its executives were sued in a securities class action lawsuit, charging them with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing. KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether CrowdStrike’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to its shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

Title: The Zombie Stock List Makes Another Call For Five9

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. I first put Five9 Inc. (FIVN) in the Danger Zone and named it a Zombie Stock in December 2022. Most recently, I reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in August 2024, but I removed it from my Zombie Stocks List. Note that the short strategy based on my Zombie Stock List has outperformed the S&P 500 since inception in June 2022. However, the business is running low on cash again and qualifies as a Zombie Stock. So, Five9 is back on the Zombie Stock List. Even with FIVN down 35%+ year-to-date (YTD), further downside remains in this stock. Five9 grew subscription revenue 16% year-over-year (YoY) in 2Q25. This growth was largely driven by enterprise AI revenue growth of 42%. Five9’s total revenue grew 12% YoY in 2Q25. Five9’s management also increased its full year 2025 revenue guidance, which now equals 10% YoY. In the same release, management increased its adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 1% for the same period. Despite growing revenue in 2Q25 and guiding for YoY growth in the full year, Five9’s revenue growth has been slowing in recent years, while the company has yet to generate any annual profits since 2019. This business is a cash-burning machine and doesn’t have a long runway ahead of it, as I’ll show below. Unprofitable companies with fast-depleting cash reserves are risky investments in any market. These risks are higher when the cost of raising capital is higher. Five9’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) increased from 9.3% in 2019 to 10.1% in the TTM. In August 2024 I removed FIVN from the Zombie Stocks List after the company issued senior convertible notes and increased cash on hand, which ultimately increased Five9’s cash runway to more than 24 months. However, Five9’s cash on hand fell from $1.1 billion in the TTM ended 2Q24 to $636 million in the TTM ended 2Q25. With this lower cash balance (and consistently negative FCF), Five9 can only sustain its TTM free cash flow (FCF) burn for 24 months from the end of August. The company also has a negative interest coverage ratio, and now officially earns its spot back on the Zombie Stocks List. The company will likely need to raise expensive capital once again to avoid bankruptcy, unless it can engineer a turnaround in the profitability of its operations. Otherwise, the stock has a real risk of going to $0/share. Figure 1: Five9 Is Back on the Zombie Stocks List * As of 6/30/25** To calculate “Months till Bankruptcy” I divided the TTM FCF burn, excluding acquisitions, by 12 to get the monthly cash burn. I then divide reported cash and equivalents and long-term investments in the most recent 10-Q by the monthly cash burn. Five9’s FCF has been negative on an annual basis in eight of the ten years of my model (since 2015) and is negative in the TTM ended 2Q25. 2018 was the last annual period the company generated positive FCF. On a quarterly basis, the company generated a positive FCF in just one (3Q20) out of the last 20 quarters. Since 2017, Five9 has burned through a cumulative $1.1 billion (47% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. In the TTM, the company’s cash burn sits at -$299 million. Figure 2: Five9’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2015 Through 1H25 Despite regularly selling stock, the company is still low on cash. Per Figure 3, Five9’s shares have increased YoY every year since the company’s IPO in 2014. Five9’s shares outstanding nearly doubled from 38 million shares at the end of 2014 to 76 million shares at the end of 2Q25. Figure 3: Five9’s Shares Outstanding: 2014 – 2Q25 Five9 continues to grow revenue, but its growth rates are on the decline. The company grew revenue YoY by: Going forward, management guided for 10% YoY revenue growth in 2025, a further slowdown from 2024. Additionally, analysts expect Five9’s revenue growth to lag the forecasted contact center software industry growth rates in the coming years. While analysts expect Five9’s revenue to grow 10% in the full year 2025 and 9% in both 2026 and 2027, Precedence Research estimates the cloud-based contact center market will grow more than twice as fast at 22% compounded annually from 2025-2034. In recent years, Five9 managed to cut its costs down relative to revenue, which helped the company improve its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). Five9’s total expenses fell from 110% of revenue in 2020 to 99% of revenue in the TTM. However, despite the improvements, Five9’s NOPAT is still negative in the TTM, and has been negative in every year in my model since 2019. The company’s NOPAT sits at -$5 million in the TTM, while its return on invested capital (ROIC) is -1% over the same time. Figure 4: Five9’s Revenue and NOPAT: 2020 – TTM Five9 is the least profitable company among peers in its industry. Per Figure 5, Five9’s NOPAT margin and ROIC both rank below all peers, which include Zoom Communications (ZM) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), SAP SE (SAP), Nice Ltd (NICE), Salesforce (CRM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), 8×8, Inc. (EGHT), Danger Zone stock Twilio (TWLO), fellow Zombie Stock Ringcentral (RNG), and more. The companies that offer full-service solutions (that tie in their contact center software solutions into their other offerings/products and offer a wider range of solutions as a one-stop shop), like Microsoft, Nice Ltd, and Cisco Systems, maintain competitive advantages over niche and singularly focused companies like Five9 and RingCentral. Figure 5: Five9’s Profitability Vs. Competitors: TTM Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the revenue and future cash flow expectations baked into Five9’s stock price. I also present an additional DCF scenario to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Five9 fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of $26/share, my model shows that Five9 would have to: In this scenario, Five9’s revenue would reach $8.5 billion in 2034 or nearly 8x the company’s TTM revenue, 3x Nice’s (NICE) TTM revenue, and nearly double Zoom’s (ZM) TTM revenue. For reference, Zoom and Nice’s combined revenue equals $7.5 billion in the TTM. This scenario also implies that Five9’s NOPAT improves to $372 million in 2034, compared to -$5 million in the TTM and the company’s record NOPAT of $6 million in 2018. In other words, to justify its current valuation, Five9 must immediately improve margins to 2x its best-ever level, while also growing revenue faster than the industry. Keep in mind, the number of companies that grow revenue by 20%+ for such a long period are also “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Five9’s share price look even more unrealistic. If I instead assume Five9: the stock would be worth just $6/share today – a 77% downside to the current price. This scenario implies that Five9 generates $5.5 billion in revenue in 2034, which would be 5x its TTM revenue. In this scenario, Five9 would also generate $121 million in NOPAT in 2034. Figure 6 compares Five9’s implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For reference, I also include the TTM revenue of competitors Zoom (ZM) and Nice (NICE). Figure 6: Five9’s Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Each of the above scenarios assume Five9 grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Five9’s invested capital has grown 27% compounded annually since 2014. If I assume Five9’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Five9 is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company owes $700 million in total debt, has $1 million in underfunded pensions, $3 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities, and just $359 million in excess cash. Five9 has an economic book value, or no growth value, of -$5/share. In other words I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

Title: Nvidia Just Gave Intel a Vote of Confidence. Will That Keep Intel's Stock Rising?

Is a deal with AI darling Nvidia enough to win investors over to Intel's stock? A $5 billion investment and a promise to co-develop chips for data centers and PCs from the chip designer at the heart of the AI boom sent Intel (INTC) shares soaring 23% to around $31 Thursday. That brought the stock to levels not seen since July 2024, before a wider-than-expected loss and massive restructuring plan announced that August dealt a blow to investor confidence and sent its stock reeling. Roughly a year later, the struggling chipmaker has welcomed a new CEO, laid off workers, and struck a deal with President Donald Trump to sell the government a 10% stake. That inspired enough confidence to bring the stock up 24% this year heading into Thursday's session. Intel was for years a blue-chip stock and a member of the Dow industrials. It's fallen on hard times recently, with the stock at half its 2021 highs. Thursday's vote of confidence from Nvidia, which replaced it in the Dow, could be seen as a turning point not only for the stock but for a company that has struggled to engineer a turnaround. Today's Nvidia-fueled (NVDA) momentum has Intel's year-to-day gains above 50%. Some analysts now think the momentum could mark a turning point in sentiment for the stock, which Wall Street has largely viewed with caution and currently sits at around half of its 2021 highs. All 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha held "hold" ratings for Intel's stock up until Thursday. The Nvidia news is "a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game," Wedbush's Dan Ives told clients in a note Thursday. Wedbush said it expects the move, which could lend Intel some of Nvidia's AI-driven tailwinds, to help stem further losses of Intel's existing market share in server and PC products and boost the company's longer-term prospects. "The chip landscape remains [Nvidia's] world with everybody else paying rent," Ives said. Bernstein analysts led by Stacy Rasgon called the blessing from Nvidia "priceless." Some analysts said Intel may need further support. Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead called it a “step in the right direction” in an interview with CNBC Thursday, though he suggested Intel likely requires another $5 billion to $10 billion to build out its chip manufacturing capabilities. However, Moorhead said, there’s now a “pretty long line of people” the chipmaker could turn to in exchange for some concessions. "The question becomes control, ownership, and voting rights," he said.

September 18, 2025 15:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally. Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups. “This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.” The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups. “NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.” NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone. Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators. “In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.” “We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.” “We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.” “The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.” “Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.” About NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.

Δ STBL mimics traditional finance’s zero-coupon strip structures by turning digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT), CoinDesk reported Thursday (Sept. 18). The components can be held separately, letting investors keep the part that appeals to them and sell the rest to counterparties that hold different attitudes to risk. “Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who also helped found Tether, said in the report. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant and built to serve the community.” When a yield-bearing on-chain asset is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and function as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance and a separate, yield-accruing NFT called YLD, according to the report. “When a user who’s already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” STBL CEO and co-founder Avtar Sehra said, per the report. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.” In related news, Tether is planning to match the success it has seen with stablecoins in other countries by bringing a new token to the United States. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Bo Hines, strategic advisor for digital assets and U.S. at Tether, said the company wants to be “the largest player in the U.S. market.” “We already are abroad, and we want to match that here,” Hines said, adding that two of the customers Tether hopes to serve in the U.S. are underbanked and underserved consumers and enterprise clients, including banks. Meanwhile, Bryce Jurss of Nuvei described to PYMNTS this week a long-term vision for stablecoins in the B2B payments sector in which businesses end up with the tokens on their balance sheets, no matter how their customers pay. “Ultimately, once it does trickle down to the consumer, they may have stablecoins, they might not even know they’re using stablecoins,” Jurss said. “And you’re getting all these faster payments happening on the back end.” Tether Co-Founder’s Startup Wants to Usher in ‘Stablecoin 2.0’ Amazon, Walmart Tap Fall Event Spending for Go-Forward Benchmarks Mastercard Expects Holiday Spending Growth to Slow to 3.6% Indian Payments Firm Pine Labs Seeks $700 Million in IPO We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

I have to say I walked into this illustrious building and the first thing that Secretary Lutnick said was “it is quite like my flat.” We now need to see evidence, or next time we have these meetings we can do it in your home. I am sure everyone would agree that this State Visit has been a remarkable and memorable few days. Mr. Secretary Lutnick, Director Michael Kratsios, and all of our guests from the United States, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, you are very, very welcome. Your presence here tonight, and in Britain this week, is an honour and, as valued friends and trusted colleagues, thank you for coming here. Mr. Secretary Lutnick, Howard, I am very grateful for the decisive role that you have played in securing our Economic Prosperity Deal earlier this year. Thank you. A deal which lowers tariffs and protects jobs in the automotive, the steel, the aluminium, the aerospace and the agricultural sectors. With your leadership, Britain has been able to be the very first country in the world to successfully negotiate such an agreement and it is also the best agreement. Our agreement shows that, for President Trump, the “art of the deal” is more than just rhetoric, it is the beating heart of his presidency. It is a vindication of the cool-headed approach adopted by both nations and advocated for by our Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, right from the very start. The Tech Prosperity Deal, signed today, is more than just a diplomatic nicety. It is a signal that the special relationship between our two countries means business. In 1944, my very celebrated predecessor as President of the Board of Trade, Churchill, first coined the phrase “special relationship” to describe the US-UK partnership. Formed at a time of war, sustained in times of peace, strengthened in times of adversity, the special relationship today is about the future prosperity of both of our countries. It is about the new technology enhancing the lives and the life chances of both of our peoples. It is the future, and it is founded on the strength of our shared, mutual friendship. Looking around this room, I see leaders of so many brilliant businesses. I want to convey my appreciation, not just for your presence, but for being so invested in modernising the special relationship, ensuring that it is relevant today and into the future. The fact that we are joined tonight by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Gloucester, the Deputy Prime Minister, our Chancellor Rachel Reeves, we have the Secretary of State for DSIT, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and so many ministers and Cabinet ministers from across Government. It is testament to the scale and ambition that we invest as this Government in the special relationship. Even before the State Visit, the trading and investment relationship between our two nations was completely unrivalled. Bilateral investment alone stood at $1.5 trillion. And over the last few days, we have added around $300bn to that total. That is almost a third of a trillion dollars being added by the partnerships announced this week. And we have secured record-breaking US investment across key growth sectors in our economy. We’re seeing big investments in financial services from CitiBank, from Bank of America and BlackRock announcing ambitious expansion plans, creating thousands of jobs from Belfast through to Edinburgh. We’re seeing new commercial partnerships being formed in our nuclear industry – with X-energy and Centrica building 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. And Amentum expanding its UK workforce by 50%. Prologis are ploughing £3bn into state-of-the-art biometric campuses in Cambridge – it is a massive win for our life sciences sector. During the State Visit, big-hitting British businesses like GSK have announced an extra $30billion of investment into the development of and manufacturing in the United States, and that will happen over the course of the next five years. And the National Grid has affirmed billions of dollars worth of investment into American businesses over the same period of time. They are working with Emerald AI’s Conductor platform and NVIDIA to drive super-efficient energy consumption right through the economy. Sage, one of the UK’s major listed companies, are making significant long-term investments into the US market: $2.3 billion in spending over the next three years. So, transatlantic trade is good for America and it is good for Britain. It is the life blood of the special relationship. The latest iteration, the Tech Prosperity Deal, unlocks growth from the very best of companies. It will endure and it will ensure the technologies will be defining the next 100 years – from AI to quantum computing – and build out our special relationship’s commitment to democracy and liberty, enhanced by our close security, regulatory and commercial cooperation. The Deal goes further by increasing capital flows which will help companies here in the UK and the US not just to build and do business, but to scale and scale at speed. Increased bilateral investment in technology holds the potential to create thousands of jobs and add billions of pounds to our economies. That’s why, when I moved to the Business and Trade job, the very first thing I did was to fly to Washington to close the deal for the Technology Partnership. And I want to share and thank the many, many people across businesses and across Government here who informed these discussions. Months of determined work have paid off for the UK and the USA. Together with the Economic Prosperity Deal, this partnership will secure success for our trillion-dollar tech sectors in the 21st century. My focus now is ensuring that we build on that momentum. I want us to dive into the delivery of this partnership with even greater determination than its design and its deployment. By doing so, we will be writing the next exciting chapter in our special relationship: where we make it easier than ever before for Britain and America to do business and to make, sell, invest, and to grow. Our history shows, that when the two great countries work together there is nothing beyond our reach. That was shown in the beaches of Normandy at D-Day and in the defeat of fascism. It was shown in the discovery of the DNA structure – a collaboration between British and American scientists – that laid the groundwork for the genetic research that revolutionised medicine. And it was shown in the transformation of global communications - with American internet foundations and British World Wide Web – that led the way to the digital world that we now live. And now, with the deals that we have secured, with the partnerships that we have agreed, we can be confident that the future of the special relationship is now stepping up a gear. Thanks to the brilliant businesses that are here today – those who work and trade across the Atlantic – the special relationship endures and it strengthens and thrives. The transatlantic businesses and the opportunities that we created will be transformative into the future and I couldn’t be more excited and proud at that proposal.

Title: A Dividend Cut Just Created A 9.2% Monthly Dividend Bargain
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/18/a-dividend-cut-just-created-a-92-monthly-dividend-bargain/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Most Wall Street “suits” are allergic to dividend cuts. These spreadsheet jockeys sooooo lack imagination. They prefer linear trends—up and to the right. Dividend growers model nicely. Payout “resets” (cuts!) do not. So, there is often a knee-jerk reaction from analysts to sell every divvie slash they see. Same goes for most individual income investors. These vanilla beans sold BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ) late last week when BlackRock sliced the dividends for three of its popular funds. The weaker hands sold. Big payouts remain. As contrarians, we’re intrigued. Dividend cuts, ironically, often mark the start of opportunity. Here’s what the knee-jerk sellers miss: In other words, the “bad news” is already priced in. This nifty 9.2% monthly dividend can now be had for 89 cents on the dollar. Why the deal? Because this is a CEF. Unlike ETFs or mutual funds, CEFs raise a fixed pool of capital at launch. After that, shares just trade back and forth on the exchange. That creates inefficiencies—often big ones. When investors sell (like last week), they often dump CEF shares without looking at the underlying assets. Discounts widen, even if the portfolio is perfectly fine. That’s when dividend deal hunters like us step in! CEF discounts open the door. Politics blow it off the hinge. Wall Street is worried about President Trump letting RFK Jr. “go wild on health” from his perch at HHS. The first-level fear is that pressure on drug prices is bearish for healthcare. But remember Trump 1.0: big pharma lagged, while biotech and medical device makers soared. BMEZ’s portfolio today is a blend of biotech and medical device makers with big potential. These aren’t cartel-like insurers or big pharma names whose product prices the government may cap. BMEZ holds the kinds of firms that benefited the most in Trump 1.0: healthcare innovators that thrive when regulation lightens. Top holding Alnylam (ALNY) is a pioneer in “RNA interference”—a cutting-edge class of medicine that essentially turns off disease-causing genes. Alnylam’s therapeutics are being explored for treating genetic, heart and neurological diseases. Bad genes? Alnylam fixes them. The company’s research benefits from less regulation. The stock soared under Trump 1.0, racking up 300%+ gains. And the sequel is shaping up to be even bigger with ALNY already up 90%: Number two BMEZ holding, Veeva Systems (VEEV), gained a fantastic 570% under Trump 1.0. The life sciences software and data provider benefits from a looser healthcare mergers and acquisitions environment because Veeva’s existing customers install Veeva’s platforms on newly-acquired corporate laptops. VEEV shares lost 4% in Biden’s four years as sector M&A slowed, but they are already up 29% as the healthcare deals begin to flow. ALNY and VEEV are increasingly hot tickers, and deservedly so. But they are hidden beneath the cloak of BMEZ! The discount to NAV means we’re paying less than 90 cents on the dollar for this duo. Dexcom (DXCM), is the fund’s number three holding. It makes continuous glucose monitors that are quickly replacing old-school finger sticks for diabetes management. Its stock climbed 354% under Trump 1.0. Let’s put the dividend reset in perspective. We are moving from a variable monthly overpayment to a consistent 11 cents per month. BlackRock is like a carpenter. Management measured twice so that they can cut just once and leave the payout at these levels for the foreseeable future: So we have a 9.2% divvie supported by the current administration’s policies. With an 11% discount to boot! The vanilla sellers may regret dumping this well-supported monthly dividend. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Dogecoin’s first ETF launches after SEC eases pathway for crypto funds to enter public markets
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/18/dogecoin-xrp-etf-rex-osprey-sec-rule-change-exchanges/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T18:38:22Z
Full Content:
Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Investors can now speculate on a dog-themed memecoin straight from their brokerage accounts. On Thursday morning, the U.S.’s first spot Dogecoin ETF went live on Cboe BZX, an exchange headquartered in Chicago. Spot funds give traders exposure to current asset prices—as opposed to futures or other derivatives. Dogecoin is widely considered to be the first memecoin, or a cryptocurrency that references an online joke and doesn’t have underlying utility. Dogecoin derives its name from a popular meme that features a Shiba Inu dog and absurdist text, like “so amaze.” The launch of a memecoin ETF illustrates the shift in the regulatory landscape over the past year in favor of the crypto industry—especially since blockchain advocates battled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for years to launch a spot ETF for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Now, especially with new rule changes voted in Wednesday by the SEC, the floodgates for funds tied to digital assets appear to be wide open. The ETF issuer Rex Financial and its sister firm Osprey Funds, which specializes in crypto investments, jointly manage the Dogecoin ETF. The fund is listed with the ticker DOJE. The price of the memecoin is up 7% over the past 24 hours to almost 29 cents, according to data from Binance. “We’re doing something nobody’s ever done, and it’s catching a lot of people by surprise,” Greg King, CEO of REX Financial, told Fortune. The Dogecoin ETF, like other crypto funds, lets traditional investors and institutions, who usually don’t have access to crypto exchanges like Coinbase, speculate on cryptocurrencies from within traditional brokerage platforms such as Fidelity. Proponents have long said crypto ETFs can attract new investors to allocate portions of their portfolio into digital assets, but for years, the SEC blocked spot crypto ETFs from going live. The agency cited fears of market manipulation for its hesitancy. In January 2024, after a prolonged legal battle with the crypto financial firm Grayscale, the agency relented, and the U.S.’s first spot Bitcoin ETFs came to market, including an entry from the asset management titan BlackRock. Since their launch, over $57 billion in capital has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., according to data from the crypto analytics site SoSoValue. The success of the Bitcoin funds opened the floodgates for new crypto ETFs to hit the market. Soon, in July 2024, BlackRock and other competitors launched ETFs for Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. And, one year later, Rex Financial and Osprey Funds launched the first ETF for Solana, another digital asset. On Wednesday, the SEC approved rule changes to allow exchanges to adopt generic listing requirements for digital asset ETFs. Rather than needing to pass through customized, manual review from the SEC, ETF issuers will send their proposals directly to the exchanges. That fast-tracking has at least one regulator worried. “The Commission is passing the buck on reviewing these proposals and making the required investor protection findings, in favor of fast tracking these new and arguably unproven products to market,” wrote Caroline Crenshaw, a commissioner at the SEC, in a statement alongside the agency’s decision. On Thursday, Rex Financial and Osprey Funds also launched the first spot ETF for XRP, another cryptocurrency. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: BlackRock And Other Institutions Stacking XRP? Why A Major Supply Shock Could Be In The Works
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/big-institutions-stacking-xrp/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T18:00:06Z
Full Content:
Crypto analyst Versan Aljarrah has made a bullish case for XRP, stating that a major supply shock is inevitable. He claimed that BlackRock and other major institutions have been quietly accumulating for a while, which is why he believes investors should not sell their XRP. In an X post, Aljarrah stated that an XRP supply shock is inevitable, as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and major institutions have been quietly buying for years, while retail investors are being shaken out. He added that the Fed, stablecoins, and tokenized assets are all part of the same play and that this is digital gold, in reference to XRP, in motion. In a YouTube video, he further explained how he expects a significant amount of the world’s liquidity to pass through XRP. He noted that the altcoin and its ecosystem are built for infinite scalability. As such, he expects tokenization, stablecoins, and other on-chain activities to primarily take place on the XRP Ledger, which increases XRP’s utility. Aljarrah asserted that there is no ceiling for the XRP price and that it all depends on the demand for the altcoin. He remarked that the price will have to continue rising to accommodate this increasing demand. The analyst described market cap as nothing and that price action is simply determined by utility. It is worth mentioning that he recently declared that XRP’s circulating supply is smaller than market participants think. Another analyst, David, who was on the podcast with Aljarrah, said that those who keep alluding to XRP’s market cap as the reason it cannot reach these ambitious targets are short-sighted. He noted how years ago, no one would have imagined that a single company would be valued in trillions of dollars. As such, he believes there is no reason why XRP cannot reach such heights at some point. In another X post, Aljarrah said that for XRP to reach $100, it will start with these big players quietly accumulating. He again asserted that banks, financial institutions, and investors have been building positions for years and buying billions of XRP, while retail investors are being shaken out. The analyst explained that this accumulation reduces circulating supply and triggers the first real supply shock. Furthermore, he explained that the XRP rally from $100 to $1,000 requires widespread integration into the global financial system. Aljarrah remarked that at this level, the altcoin shifts from being a retail speculative asset to a functional utility as it becomes the preferred settlement mechanism for banks, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. The analyst also believes XRP will reach $10,000 once it can absorb the global liquidity. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.08, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Tech stocks surged in recent trading, pushing the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to record highs. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, and the two agreed to co-develop new data center and PC chips. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were up as well. Shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also gained following an agreement that will have PayPal use Google’s artificial intelligence tools to boost internet commerce. CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares jumped after the cybersecurity firm gave a better-than-expected forecast for annual recurring revenue. Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares slumped as the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains missed profit estimates and warned higher costs could hurt future earnings. Shares of another restaurant operator, Cracker Barrel (CBRL), sank as the blowback from the restaurant chain’s location updates and logo change hit its results and guidance. A lower-than-anticipated outlook sent shares of Nucor (NUE) lower. The steelmaker said it sees weakness in all its segments. Oil futures rose and gold prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: Pundit Shares ‘XRP Endgame’: What To Watch Out For With Ripple
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-endgame-with-ripple/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto pundit Pumpius is drawing attention to what he calls the “XRP Endgame,” saying all the key pieces are falling into place for Ripple and its token. According to him, these shifts put XRP in a rare position to rise above other digital assets. Global rules and banking standards are also moving in Ripple’s favor at the same time. Pumpius stresses that Ripple’s victory in its long fight with the SEC is not just a legal win but a turning point. After years in court, XRP now has the strongest legal clarity of any cryptocurrency in the U.S. He also points to Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its enterprise stablecoin backed by reserves at BNY Mellon. Pumpius notes that this connection matters because BNY Mellon safeguards trillions in assets for global giants, including BlackRock and the U.S. Treasury. Tying a stablecoin to XRP’s payment rails creates what he calls a “stable reserve army” that strengthens trust in Ripple’s network. On the banking front, Pumpius explains that Ripple is not only licensed as a money service business but has also applied for the highly difficult New York banking charter. He adds that Ripple has taken it a step further by applying for a Federal Reserve master account, the highest privilege in the U.S. banking system. If granted, Ripple would not just compete with banks but effectively act as one, placing XRP at the center of financial settlements. Pumpius notes that nearly 20 XRP spot ETFs are awaiting approval. If greenlit, these funds could open the doors to trillions of dollars from institutional investors and push XRP into the ranks of Wall Street assets overnight. Another major shift is the migration to ISO 20022, a global messaging standard that all major banks must adhere to by November. Pumpius points out that XRP has been ready for this for years, meaning RippleNet can easily connect with traditional banking rails the moment the change takes effect. Additionally, he notes that XRP is in the liquidity tokenization plan of DTCC, the world’s largest settlement utility. At the same time, he notes that the DNA Protocol is quietly developing biometric and genomic identity tools on the XRP Ledger. This step could solve Know Your Customer checks at the deepest level, blending finance and digital identity in a way no other blockchain has achieved. Ripple benefits as he notes the rise of a supportive political environment. A pro-crypto administration is pushing laws that fit Ripple’s long-term playbook. With regulators and policymakers leaning in the same direction, he believes the stage is set for XRP to move into its endgame.

Δ This collaboration will see the companies launch trading and lending solutions powered by tokenized money market funds and stablecoins, Ripple announced Thursday (Sept. 18). “2025 has been marked by a series of industry-firsts when it comes to traditional financial institutions moving onchain — and the linkup between Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable repo trades for a tokenized money market fund with a regulated, stable and liquid mode of exchange such as RLUSD is truly a game-changer,” said Nigel Khakoo, vice president and global head of trading and markets at Ripple. “Investors can also seamlessly rebalance their portfolios between a stablecoin and a yield-generating money market fund, all within a single, trusted ecosystem, unlocking real-world capital efficiency, utility and liquidity that institutions demand.” According to a Ripple news release, the partnership will see DBS’s Digital Exchange list sgBENJI — the token of Franklin Templeton’s tokenized money market fund — alongside Ripple’s RLUSD. This setup lets DBS clients trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, allowing them to “rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the companies said. As the partnership progresses, DBS will explore helping customers unlock liquidity by using their sgBENJI tokens as collateral, the release added.

Title: Trump Pals The Ellison Boys Gonna Save CBS And TikTok From Woke Bias!

Time Published: 2025-09-18T15:02:02Z

Sounds like President Trump is inching closer towards his wish to be king of all media and star of every stage! He coyly hinted on his shitty web platform on Monday: The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly. A deal was also reached on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!! President DJT And Trump’s sherpa of deals/ mean drunk/ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there was a “framework for a deal” for a TikTok sale, though he has said the words “framework for a deal” eleventy-hundred times. Through the months of Trump’s insane pingponging deals with China we have learned that “framework” and “deal” are two very different things. Though at least this is better than the “handshake for a framework” Howard Lutnick said they had back in June. So on Friday are Trump and Scott Bessent really, finally going to get that deal from China on those rare earth minerals, the ones US tech companies need to make all of their AI chips, planes, and high-tech gadgets that Trump screwed them out of by self-embargoing the US? It’s concepts of a framework for maybe! Subscribe! But anyway, word on the street, aka CBS and the Wall Street Journal, is that the deal old Pappy was going on about up there is the potential sale of TikTok to Oracle, whose CEO is his close pal Larry Ellison, and some private equity firms. If the name rings a bell, it’s because Larry Ellison’s son David is the new chairman and CEO of Paramount, after completing a merger between Paramount (CBS’s parent company) and Ellison’s company, Skydance. And both father and son are longtime Republican donors. And father Larry may be richer than Elon Musk now! At least he’s not in on the deal. Oh, and now Paramount Skydance is reportedly in talks to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, too, the parent company of CNN. Those Ellison boys are making the kind of cross-platform Republican media control that Project 2025 once only dreamed of! How long until somebody greenlights that immigration reality show that Kristi Noem denied she was workshopping? TikTok being forced under his thumb has apparently long been a wish of Trump’s, at least since app users first ground his gears back in 2020 by registering to attend his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with no intention of showing up, causing his delicate ego embarrassment when the yuge surging crowd he was expecting turned out to be a mere trickle. He raged for TikTok to be BANNED, because something something Chinese spies, and Congress passed an act that banned the app unless its algorithm was put under the control of a US company. And Joe Biden signed it! Remember that extra-stupid hearing with TikTok’s CEO Shou Chew, with Tom Cotton refusing to accept that he is from Singapore, which is a whole different country than China, and how embarrassingly pig-ignorant the senators were about the basics of how the Internet even works? But, the Chinese government doesn’t and has never owned TikTok. A Chinese man founded it and is still 20 percent of the board, but the company was never incorporated in China. There has been no evidence that the Chinese government ever had access to user data, much less that they were using it to spy on dissidents or Americans making cucumber salads. TikTok is owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore. And its servers — ORACLE servers, in fact — dish out its secret-sauce algorithm from Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is currently owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. But Congress and Biden decided to ban the app anyway, after Trump had said it was a CHINESE SPY EMERGENCY. And then some curious things happened! Jeff Yass, the managing director of Susquehanna International Group, the company that is also the largest shareholder of TikTok’s parent company, bought two percent of Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, making its share price surge 140 percent, defibrillating Trump’s flatlining company. And then right before the ‘24 election, the TikTok algorithm underwent a noticeable shift, and Trumpy content began appearing in people’s feeds when it hadn’t before. And TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump’s inauguration in January. And after his win, Trump credited TikTok with helping him win more young voters, so he loved it again and decided to save it, even going to the Supreme Court to try to stop them from enacting the ban he himself had asked Congress to pass. The deadline for a sale has since been extended four times already, and has now been pushed off until December 16. The Wall Street Journal has more details of the prospective deal: The company’s board would stay the same, except that Zhang Yiming’s stake would be reduced to less than 20 percent, and a consortium of US companies, including Susquehanna International, KKR, General Atlantic Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz would control 80 percent of the company. A new US entity would be created, with a board with one member designated by the US government, which is unheard of. And the US company would license the magic algorithm, putting it into a new US version of the app, so that the Trumpy board would be able to customize it and make it massage everybody’s feed this way and that, promoting the reach of some accounts and limiting access to others. Meanwhile, CBS under control of its new owner Paramount has a whole other vibe. Paramount Global and CBS CEO George Cheeks hasn’t been fired (yet), but he obeyed in advance. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was cancelled before the deal even went down, and Trump’s claims against 60 Minutes for making Kamala Harris look too smart got settled for a $16 million donation to his presidential library before the merger was approved. And CBS News employees say Ellison the younger broke his promise not to politicize their news reporting almost immediately, reportedly entering talks to buy The Free Press, owned by anti-woke “free speech” crusader Bari Weiss, who got her start ratting out professors for being pro-Arab, for “well above” $100 million and installing her into some kind of a senior leadership role to tone-police the reporting at CBS News. PREVIOUSLY! And Ellison brought on a conservative thinktanker from the Hudson Institute, Kenneth R. Weinstein, to be an ombudsman rooting out any “complaints of bias” that might aggrieve conservatives at CBS. But it all doesn’t go far enough for everybody on the Right, of course. Now at least one Federalist Society weirdo is proposing that the government shut down Bluesky, and Discord too. But social media sites, they’re not just for cat memes! Businesses do about $15 billion in sales a year on TikTok. And TikTok and Discord have been critical to documenting human rights abuses, and organizing protests, such as recently in Nepal. There’s many times more young people in the US and around the world on Discord (614 million users) and on TikTok (2 billion users) than who are watching 60 Minutes (about 8 million viewers) so, of course the dominionists want to dominate it. And whatever other platforms they can get their filthy paws on, to better control every sphere of American life. Oh did they throw Jimmy Kimmel off the air, “indefinitely”? They did that last night too, with the FCC threatening that ABC’s broadcast license was in danger after Kimmel criticized the regime’s response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest public company by market cap, said it will invest $5 billion in Intel (INTC) and work with the chipmaker on developing custom data-center and PC products as artificial intelligence becomes more pervasive. AI crypto tokens rose on the news. The Santa Clara, California-based maker of the graphic processing units (GPUs) that underpin AI computing will buy shares of its neighbor at $23.28 each, 6.5% lower than Wednesday's closing price of $24.90, according to an announcement on Thursday. NEAR, the largest AI crypto token by market cap, climbed to over $2.95, its highest in a month, gaining more than 10% in 24 hours. TAO advanced 5.75% and FET 6.75%, outperforming the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk 20 Index added 3.41%. While Nvidia is known for its GPU production, Intel was a leader in developing microprocessors and entered public consciousness as the provider of central processing units (CPUs) that drove IBM-compatible microcomputers. Its fortunes have declined as AI, with its intensive computing requirements, has taken root. Intel stock surged 24% on Thursday, taking its market cap to $143 billion. That's just a fraction of the $500 billion it boasted in 2000, according to companiesmarketcap.com. Nvidia, with a value of $4.23 trillion, rose 1.85%. The U.S. government bought a 10% stake in Intel last month for $8.9 billion in an attempt to shore up the future of American chip manufacturing. The crypto industry watches Nvidia's performance with a keen eye as a proxy for market sentiment, which may reflect in AI tokens and the broader crypto market. UPDATE (Sept. 18, 14:26 UTC): Adds AI crypto tokens' performance in third paragraph.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has seen six consecutive days of gains, with a cumulative return of 5.2%. The stock continued to rise in extended trading on September 17 after the company’s recent Fal.Con 2025 conference. At the conference, CrowdStrike announced its focus on "securing the AI revolution" and set an ambitious goal of reaching $20 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2036. The company also provided specific financial targets for fiscal year 2027, including over 20% net new ARR growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24% or more. These announcements, combined with some recent price target increases from Wall Street analysts, have contributed to the stock’s rally. In fact, the company has increased in value by approximately $5.8 billion over the last six days, bringing its current market value to around $111 billion. The stock is currently 30.2% higher than its value at the conclusion of 2024. This is in contrast to year-to-date returns of 12.2% for the S&P 500. CRWD offers cloud-based protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and modules via direct sales and channel partners. Following this surge, is CRWD still a worthwhile investment – or is it time to secure profits? Explore further with Buy or Sell CRWD. The table below highlights the returns for CRWD stock compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the ongoing streak: What is the point? Momentum frequently comes before conviction. A multi-day winning streak may indicate rising investor confidence or incite additional purchasing. Keeping track of such trends can assist you in capitalizing on the strength or getting ready for a timely entry if the momentum wanes. Nonetheless, large profits can lead to sharp reversals – but how has CRWD performed following previous declines? View CRWD Dip Buyer Analysis to discover more. Currently, there are 33 S&P constituents that have experienced 3 or more days of consecutive gains and 60 constituents with 3 or more days of consecutive losses. While CRWD stock appears appealing due to its winning streak, investing in a single stock without comprehensive and careful analysis can entail risks.

Title: Nvidia will take a $5 billion stake in Intel, joining the US government as a major shareholder | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia said on Thursday that it would buy $5 billion worth of Intel’s common stock, becoming another major shareholder in the beleaguered company just weeks after the US government took a roughly 10% stake. The tech giant, which makes artificial intelligence chips, will pay $23.28 per share, it said in a joint press release. The purchase will give Nvidia around 4% or more of Intel after new shares are issued to complete the deal, Reuters reported. Intel shares (INTC) surged 22.77% on Thursday and posted their biggest single-day gain since 1987. Nvidia shares (NVDA), meanwhile, gained 3.49%. Last month, US President Donald Trump and Intel announced that the government was making an $8.9 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, with Trump calling it “a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future.” “This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. The investment is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and cement America’s position as a leader in the global chipmaking industry. Trump has said that he plans to impose 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, excluding suppliers that have committed to building products in the United States. Although Intel was once one of America’s most important tech companies, it has fallen behind rivals after failing to anticipate successive technology waves. Lip-Bu Tan, who took over as CEO in March, has been attempting to turn the company around. The two tech companies also announced that they would jointly develop custom data center and personal computing products. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said the overall agreement was “a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game.” “Today’s announcement further strengthens the US lead in the AI arms race against China as Intel now goes from a laggard to a catalyst,” they wrote in a note.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced a collaboration to jointly develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise and consumer markets. The companies will focus on seamlessly connecting NVIDIA and Intel architectures using NVIDIA NVLink — integrating the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers. For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market. For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs. NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. The investment is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. “AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.” “Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.” Press Conference: The CEOs of NVIDIA and Intel will conduct a webcast press conference at 10 a.m. Pacific time (1 p.m. Eastern time) today to discuss the announcement.

Stock futures are sharply higher after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year; Intel (INTC) shares are soaring on news that AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in the beleaguered chipmaker; Meta Platforms (META) revealed its AI-powered glasses; and StubHub (STUB) stock is pointing lower after shares in the ticket reseller fell in their first trading session. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring as investors digest the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark rate and the economic projections of Fed officials. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than 1% this morning, while those linked to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also solidly higher. The major indexes are on track to open at all-time highs, after turning in a mixed performance yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was down slightly at 4.06%. Bitcoin is at $117,200, trading at its highest levels in a month, while gold futures fell slightly to $3,700 an ounce. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings. Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%. Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading. Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday.

Title: Forbes Daily: Federal Reserve Signals ‘Lift-Off’ For Rate Cuts

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. It finally happened. After months of pressure from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve eased interest rates Wednesday. The central bank slashed the federal funds rate by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25%, and said it expects two more cuts by the end of the year amid concerns about a weakening labor market. In a note, Fitch Ratings’ head of U.S. economic research called the decision “lift-off” for a “decisively aggressive cutting cycle.” For consumers, lower interest rates mean cheaper borrowing costs and a potential drop in mortgage rates. Crypto could even get a boost, as some Americans could opt for riskier assets to earn a greater yield. ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air Wednesday due to the host’s comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Shortly before the Disney-owned broadcaster made the announcement, media company Nexstar, which owns a number of local ABC affiliates, said it would preempt the late-night talk show. The decision comes as Nexstar seeks FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of TEGNA, which would give it the largest share of local TV stations in the U.S. After three failed efforts to take StubHub public, cofounder Eric Baker finally got his wish Wednesday as the online ticket marketplace began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on its $23.50 per share listing price, the company is valued at $8.6 billion, giving Baker an estimated net worth of $800 million. Shares of Lyft reached a three-year high as the rideshare firm announced a partnership with Waymo that will bring the autonomous ride-hailing service to Nashville. Waymo is looking to grow the market for its robotaxi rides, and has received $12 billion in investments from parent company Alphabet and others. Meta’s share price rose in premarket trading this morning after it showed off a new pair of AI-powered smart glasses at the company's Meta Connect keynote Wednesday night. The new Meta Ray-Ban Display will be able to read messages, receive video calls and follow map directions on its right lens. The glasses will be available September 30 and cost $799. A new climate economy is advancing in spite of threats to stall its progress, fueled by record clean energy investment, China’s green-tech boom, and a worldwide surge in renewable power. The second Forbes Sustainability Leaders list honors 50 individuals setting the pace for a just, sustainable economy and defining what climate leadership looks like today. MORE: Among the list’s honorees is billionaire Wendy Schmidt: She and her husband, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, have directed a significant portion of their $2 billion in lifetime giving toward environmental initiatives. The stakes for private science funding have never been higher, with Donald Trump back in the White House and a second wave of federal rollbacks targeting climate funding and scientific independence. A small Israeli startup is stress testing AI models for giants like OpenAI and Anthropic to evaluate their capacity for malicious hacking, as the industry grapples with AI misuse. On Wednesday, the startup, which is changing its name to Irregular, announced $80 million in new funding, valuing it at $450 million. As ICE builds up its arsenal of equipment like tactical gear, guns and surveillance kits, contract records show the agency spent $78,000 on a robot capable of opening doors, climbing stairs and firing off smoke bombs during house raids. The contracts, along with purchases of drones and AI-powered facial recognition technology, have raised concerns about ICE’s spending on surveillance and arms that could be used to target the immigrant population. The CDC’s immunization advisory committee—whose membership Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. purged in June and replaced with people more aligned with his anti-vaccine views—is slated to meet starting today. On the agenda, a topic crucial to the health of the country and its pharma industry: childhood vaccinations, as well as Covid-19 shots. Since his appointment, Kennedy has been pushing anti-vaccine policies at the federal level and this meeting could prove critical for U.S. immunization policy going forward. Already, he has announced plans to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to “investigate” long-debunked links between vaccines and autism, and appointed committee members like Retsef Levi and Robert Malone, who have been outspoken opponents of Covid vaccines, which saved an estimated 14.4 million lives the first year after they were made available, and Catherine Stein, who has argued against vaccine mandates. All of this puts pharmaceutical companies into uncharted territory. Vaccines are a big business: Grand View Research estimates the global vaccine market reached $88 billion last year, with the U.S. accounting for the major share of it. They’re also a safe business: Many vaccines have been around for decades, and regulations around them have been both relatively certain and grounded in evidence. That may no longer be the case. On Friday, shares of the biggest Covid-19 vaccine makers fell dramatically when Trump Administration health officials indicated they were investigating unsubstantiated reports of child deaths from the vaccine. WHY IT MATTERS The United States’ childhood immunization program is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements of public health. It eradicated measles in the U.S. by the year 2000, slashed the infection rate of hepatitis B by 99%, and turned whooping cough into a rarity. Any weakening of recommendations for childhood immunizations could lead to fewer shots, and even a 10% drop in childhood vaccinations could lead to millions of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths among the nation’s children, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MORE Trump Administration’s Attack On MRNA Vaccines Threatens American Biotech Dominance French luxury conglomerate Kering, parent of brands such as Gucci and Alexander McQueen, confirmed that customer data was stolen in an April cyberattack, potentially impacting millions. It’s the latest luxury company to fall victim to cybercriminals: 7.4 million: The number of unique email addresses hacker group Shiny Hunters, which claimed credit for the breach, told the BBC that it had Over $10,000, up to $86,000: The amount spent by Kering customers in sample records the BBC reviewed, which contained their names and phone numbers 16%: The sales decline Kering reported in the first half of 2025 Everyone faces hardship in life, but it’s important to find ways to stay true to who you are even amid the most difficult of times. Embrace the cycle of struggle and rebirth, and focus your identity on your strengths—rather than just what you do for work. Lastly, create a sense of urgency around your goals to ensure you don’t procrastinate.

U.S. stock market futures rose today following the Federal Reserve's rate cut, with all three major indexes climbing in early trading. The Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first cut of the year, and signaled the possibility of two more cuts in 2025, boosting investor sentiment. The rate cut helped lift optimism in sectors poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs, especially tech stocks, which contributed to the Nasdaq's stronger futures gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 futures also rose significantly, expected to thrive in a lower interest rate environment.

Time Published: 2025-09-18T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
The hope for the S&P 500’s small-cap cousin after the Fed’s rate cut tells an important story about the broader economy. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com Federal Reserve officials lowered the target range for their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4% to 4.25% — with Chair Jerome Powell flagging weakening jobs data — and penciled in two more cuts by the end of 2025. Yawn. The only thing less surprising than that yesterday was the calendar showing the day was Wednesday. But as Powell emphasized the Fed’s jobs, jobs, jobs focus, a winner emerged on the trading floor: the small-cap Russell 2000, a laggard during this year’s market rally that is now on pace to finally break the nearly four-year drought since its last record closing high. The S&P 500, naturally, has been on a tear, setting five records this month alone. Some market watchers including Deutsche Bank, factoring in rate cuts as drivers of stock prices, think it can hit 7,000 by the end of the year. The hope for its small-cap cousin, meanwhile, is less ambitious but tells an important story about the broader economy. The Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of 2,000 smaller companies in the broader Russell 3000 Index, was underwater through the end of June, while the S&P 500 had recovered from the post-Liberation Day tariffs shock by mid-May. But since the end of July, the Russell 2000 has jumped 10%, double the S&P’s rise in the same time. Following the rate cut announcement on Wednesday, the small-cap index rose more than 2% and at one point advanced past its all-time closing high of 2,442.74. It ultimately pared gains and finished up 0.2%, but a new record high, topping the one set in November 2021, seems finally within reach. That’s because of the unique meaning of a rate cut for small-caps: Not Out of the Woods: Reduced interest costs, of course, aren’t the only high-level economic factor on the minds of executives and investors. One risk for small-cap firms is that their lower margins, higher debt loads and attenuated supply chains are all highly sensitive to tariffs, which Powell said Wednesday could lead to a “one-time shift” in prices or cause “more persistent” inflation. For the time being, Bank of America and UBS are among the Wall Street heavyweights that foresee a Russell 2000 rebound. But even those who expect the market rally to broaden and include small caps, like Goldman Sachs, have cautioned, “there is limited scope for small-caps and other ‘lower quality’ stocks to consistently outperform,” which is a hint that you should diversify your portfolio. And yet, last week, Tesla scored a couple key brownie points from Wall Street analysts. So why the optimism? Meta will likely soon face competition from Amazon, Alphabet, Snap and other tech firms with augmented-reality glasses in development. President Trump wants to end mandated quarterly financial reports for publicly traded companies. Odds are his dream comes true. In a note last week, JPMorgan’s Andrew Tyler wrote that macro conditions could turn a widely-expected rate cut into a “sell the news” event. Demand for copper, already one of the most commonly used metals in the world, has surged amid the AI computing boom. The return-to-office orders have taken on new weight amid a softening labor market and broader economic anxiety. More than 94 million pet-owning US households are expected to spend $157 billion on their little Lunas and Rexes this year. Morgan Stanley analysts think the US economy has been in a “rolling recession” since 2022 — and it may already be almost over. iPhone sales surged to $44.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, besting analysts’ $40 billion expectations and rising 14% year-over-year. Investor appetite for StubHub and Klarna is especially compelling at a time when consumer sentiment starting to slump. The latest jobs report appeared to confirm that America’s labour market is slowing, which may clinch the rate cut markets are salivating over. Small, mountainous Switzerland — a country that ranks 61st in the world by total area — is one of the world’s biggest investors in the US. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How Micron Stock Surges 2x To $300
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/18/how-micron-stock-surges-2x-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T09:00:27Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Micron Technology stock (NASDAQ:MU) has increased approximately 80% from about $87 at the beginning of 2025 to nearly $157, reaching all-time highs in the process. So, what is driving this increase for Micron? It all revolves around the demand for AI infrastructure, which is boosting sales of high-bandwidth memory products, also referred to as HBM. Even after this substantial rally, Micron stock is valued at about 20× estimated earnings for 2025. Projected growth looks robust: expected revenues are set to rise by 48% this fiscal year, based on consensus estimates, while growth is anticipated at roughly 31% for FY’26. Given this strong growth paired with a reasonable valuation, could Micron stock potentially double to around $300? Below, we outline this scenario. Demand is being propelled by the swift adoption of generative AI, which necessitates high-performance memory to function at scale. While DRAM offers capacity, HBM supplies the bandwidth and low latency required for large language models. Micron serves as a primary supplier for Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GB200 platform, alongside AMD’s Instinct MI350 series GPUs. The memory requirements for each AI system are also escalating: for example, Nvidia’s latest Blackwell systems feature 33% more memory per node compared to earlier-generation chips. Additionally, as AI models transition from being text-only to incorporating multimodal formats such as video and speech, memory intensity is on the rise. With AI expected to be broadly adopted throughout the economy, Micron is positioned for a prolonged growth trajectory. To illustrate the scale of the investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have indicated that they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective current fiscal years. However, supply may not keep pace easily. Manufacturing HBM is more intricate than standard DRAM, and supply levels are still constrained. The production of HBM is wafer-intensive — it requires approximately three times as many wafers as standard DRAM to create the same quantity of bits due to its lower bit density and intricate 3D stacking. This forms a natural bottleneck. Although Micron has been expanding its HBM production capacity, output for 2025 is already sold out, with robust demand anticipated in 2026. Micron aims to significantly increase its HBM market share, targeting about 20 to 25% of the HBM segment by the end of 2025. Beyond HBM, Micron remains the sole volume producer of low-power DRAM for data centers, providing an advantage as AI workloads increasingly emphasize efficiency. Looking forward, even after this increase, Micron does not appear to be overvalued. Its revenues surged by 58%, from $21 billion in 2023 to $34 billion in 2024, as the company rebounded from a downturn. Consensus forecasts indicate revenues climbing from roughly $25.1 billion in FY’24 to $37.1 billion in FY’25, and by about 31% to $48.7 billion in FY’26. HBM has been a significant factor in this growth, with HBM revenue achieving a $6 billion annualized run rate and a projected $10 billion run rate by 2026. Increased HBM production does place pressure on conventional DRAM supply, contributing to rising DRAM prices, which may also enhance revenues for products outside of HBM. If we project a slightly more conservative annual growth rate of 25% between FY’26 and FY’28, Micron could generate approximately $77 billion in revenues by FY’28. Micron's net margins were around 20% over the first nine months of this year. It is possible that this figure could grow further due to a higher proportion of higher-margin HBM chips and improved economies of scale. Assuming net margins rise to about 22% in FY’28, this would equate to net income of approximately $17 billion. With a forward P/E ratio of about 20x, this would imply a market cap of around $340 billion, suggesting the stock price could nearly double from current levels. That said, competition persists. SK Hynix continues to dominate the HBM market with an approximate 50% share and an advantage in production, particularly regarding HBM4. Micron is increasing HBM3E production and testing HBM4, but it is still striving to catch up. HBM4 is anticipated to power Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin architecture for AI accelerators. The memory market has also historically been subject to significant cyclical behavior, and Micron is no exception. DRAM and NAND remain vulnerable to fluctuations in supply and demand along with pricing volatility. At this time, it appears that HBM serves as a partially secular growth driver, with AI infrastructure investments, high profit margins, and strong order visibility providing some degree of protection. Nevertheless, HBM presently comprises less than 20% of total revenues, meaning the company is not entirely insulated from traditional market cycles. Furthermore, AI demand may normalize following years of heavy investment if shareholders start demanding superior returns and more efficient capital management. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Meta’s new Ray-Ban smart glasses have an integrated display and gesture-based controls

UPDATED 22:55 EDT / SEPTEMBER 17 2025 by Mike Wheatley Meta Platforms Inc. is racing ahead of its competitors in the virtual reality and augmented reality worlds with the launch of a new and more sophisticated pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses. It debuted alongside a new technology called Hyperscape, which enables Meta’s VR headset Quest to replicate real-world spaces in a virtual environment. Meta founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage late today at the company’s annual Meta Connect event, where he showcased the company’s next-generation smart glasses. They’re called the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and unlike the original Ray-Ban Meta specs, they come with a built-in display on the right lens. It’s visible only to the wearer, and meant to show various applications, notifications and directions. The smart glasses can be controlled by a special wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which picks up on the user’s gestures. There’s an integrated AI assistant that allows for voice controls so users can navigate through social media applications and browse the internet, and the specs also feature a built-in camera, speakers and microphone. Meta Ray-Ban Display is a notable upgrade that makes it possible for smart glasses to do pretty much any task that can be done on a smartphone, and if it can popularize the concept it could be a game-changer for the company. For years, Meta has been forced to reach its users through third-party devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhones, Google LLC’s Android phones and Microsoft Corp.’s Windows computers, but with the Ray-Ban Display, it now owns the hardware as well as the software. Onstage, Zuckerberg spoke about all of the different things users will be able to do with Meta Ray-Ban Display that couldn’t be done with the company’s original smart glasses. The most important thing is the display, which allows users to view posts in their Facebook feed and messages on apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as live translations. The Neural Band that ships with the device is similar to something like a Fitbit fitness device, and its purpose is to give users a way to navigate apps in Ray-Ban Display using small hand movements. It uses a technology known as electromyography, which picks up on the signals sent between the brain and the hand when performing gestures, Zuckerberg explained. He also mentioned that it’s water-resistant, just like the smart glasses, and has 18 hours of battery life. It should be noted that Meta Ray-Ban Display lacks some of the features seen on Meta’s prototype Orion smart glasses, which were shown off by Zuckerberg at Connect 2024. The Orion came with augmented reality lenses that could overlay graphics directly on the lens, and had an eye-tracking system to understand what people are looking at. Meta Ray-Ban Display, on the other hand, only has a small display integrated with what is otherwise just a standard lens. The good news is that consumers will be able to get their hands on Meta Ray-Ban Display soon. Zuckerberg said it’s going on sale in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, Ireland, UAE, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands at the end of this month, with a price tag of $799. It’s also going to launch in Brazil and India “soon.” Those who don’t find the idea of an integrated display to their liking may want to check out the improved version of Meta’s displayless Ray-Ban Meta glasses. The company’s original smart glasses are getting a better battery that lasts up to eight hours, which is almost twice as long as before. There’s also a new “conversation focus” feature that amplifies the voice of whoever the wearer is speaking to, so they can hear them more clearly in noisy environments. It utilizes the specs’ integrated microphone to pick out the speaker’s voice, while artificial intelligence algorithms filter out the background noise, Zuckerberg said. In addition, Ray-Ban Meta is adding support for German and Portuguese language translation, but it will come at a higher cost, with the new version priced at $379, up from $299 for the older model. There’s a third pair of smart specs too. Meta said it has partnered with Oakley Inc. to create the Oakley Meta Vanguard (above) which is designed for “high-intensity sports.” It was first announced earlier this year, and features Oakley’s characteristic wraparound design and integrates fitness applications like Garmin and Strava, so wearers can ask Meta AI questions about their training performance. It has an IP67 rating that certifies its dust and water resistance and comes with a 12 megapixel, 122-degree camera that’s fitted on the nose bridge, enabling it to shoot videos at 3K resolution. It also supports new capture modes including slow-motion, time-lapse and hyperlapse, which will be available on the company’s other smart glasses too. Zuckerberg said Oakley Meta Vanguard has a battery life of about nine hours, and will cost $499 when it goes on sale next month. Moving away from specs to Quest, which is Meta’s flagship VR headset, there wasn’t any new hardware on show, but the older model is getting what looks to be a fascinating new capability in the shape of Hyperscape. Zuckerberg first spoke about Hyperscape at last year’s Connect, and it’s now being made available in early access. With Hyperscape, Quest users can scan whatever physical space they happen to be in and then ask the device to recreate that environment in VR. Though the capture process only takes a few minutes, during which users just walk around the room or space and make sure everything is videoed carefully, the actual creation process will take a “few hours,” Zuckerberg said. It uses technologies including Gaussian Splatting, cloud rendering and high-bandwidth streaming to recreate an immersive, photorealistic replica of any physical space, with the new Horizon Engine enabling better graphics and faster performance to generate more realistic virtual worlds than ever seen before. On stage at Connect, Zuckerberg demonstrated a few renderings of real-world locations, including Gordon Ramsey’s kitchen (above) at his home in Los Angeles, The Octagon at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Chance the Rapper’s House of Kicks, and a room that’s filled with the social media influencer Happy Kelli’s extensive Crocs shoe collection. While users will only be able to enjoy the spaces they create alone for the time being, Zuckerberg said the company is working on allowing users to invite others into their digital spaces via a private link, and hopes to add this capability in future. The Hyperscape is being rolled out gradually on Meta’s Quest 3 and Quest 3S headsets, and will be available to users aged 18 and older.

Goldiam has responded swiftly with a U.S.‐origin casting model, a globally accepted and compliant approach that effectively mitigates tariff exposure:  Through its U.S. subsidiary, Goldiam now casts raw gold into unfinished jewellery pieces within the United States.  These castings are then shipped to India for finishing, polishing, and diamond setting.  The final jewellery is re‐exported to the U.S., where it qualifies for tariff exemptions under U.S. Customs rules. Because the gold is bought and casted in the U.S., the product retains U.S. origin status. As a result, no tariff applies to the gold component, and instead 5.5% duty is levied on the incremental value addition (diamonds and labour). Facing steep U.S. tariffs, Gokaldas Exports is boosting EU and UK shipments and shifting production to Africa, aiming to protect margins and diversify markets. Gold and silver prices drop as Federal Reserve announces rate cut, dollar strengthens, impacting bullion prices negatively. “The Federal Reserve’s 25-basis-point rate cut to 4-4.25% in September 2025, responding to a softening labor market and inflation above 2%, injects liquidity into global markets. For emerging economies like India, this sparks opportunity and risk. A weaker U.S. dollar drives capital inflows through carry trades and FDI, boosting India’s stock market and supporting its 7% GDP growth trajectory. However, currency volatility and imported inflation pose challenges, requiring careful policy navigation to ensure sustained economic gains.” Markets rise on Fed rate cut, Sensex at 82,885.17, Nifty 50 at 25,392.10; HDFC Life top gainer.

In 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board reduced the Federal Funds Rate from 5.375% to 4.375%. Today, after an extended pause, they cut it again from 4.375% to 4.125%. More importantly, the Fed signalled two additional rate cuts in 2025, which would bring the Federal Funds Rate down to 3.625% by year-end, still slightly ahead of the neutral rate. There is more room to cut rates in 2026. Historically, when the Fed lowers rates, capital tends to shift out of safe assets such as U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits into riskier assets, including equities, private equity, venture capital, and emerging markets. The anticipated rate cuts in 2025 and in 2026 are expected to boost the valuations of risky assets. As a result, India should expect stronger capital inflows—particularly in Q4, when large global asset managers finalize allocations. This comes at a time when the Indian economy is demonstrating resilience, even in the face of headwinds such as the Trump administration’s imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian exports. Overall, India stands to benefit from a “double engine” of global liquidity easing and strong domestic fundamentals. Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital. “The Fed Cuts, Wall Street Yawns Wish Granted - Like a dog chasing cars, Wall Street didn’t know what to do with itself once it finally got its rate cut. 2025 now marks the 3rd year since 1996 where rate cuts have happened with the S&P 500 at record highs The Recession That Never Was - The base case remains for a 25bp rate cut even though inflation is still running well above the 2% target based on the latest data. US headline CPI and core CPI were up 2.9% YoY and 3.1% YoY, respectively, in August. The official reason is growing evidence of labour market weakness US commercial banks’ total loan growth has risen from 1.5% YoY in mid-March 2024 to 4.6% YoY in early September 2025, while commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth is up from a negative 2.6% YoY to 4.1% YoY over the same period - For such reasons it is entirely possible to make the argument that the US economy could be in the early days of a new cyclical rebound Nifty 25330.25 Nifty has decisively closed above the high of 25250 Support Levels 20HMA: 25209 40HEMA: 25130” EaseMyTrip partners with Hoi for India's first Smart Kiosk Rewards Program at major airports, offering travel benefits to passengers. RateGain integrates UNO Channel Manager with Oracle Hospitality OPERA Cloud Distribution, offering hotels real-time control over distribution strategy. Pharmaceutical stocks rebound after Fed rate cut, Nifty Pharma index gains 0.62%, top performers include Natco Pharma and Biocon. KPI Green Energy's green bond listing marks a milestone in sustainable finance for India's renewable sector. Renisha Chainani, Head of Research of Augmont, writes - Gold and silver prices continued to decline as a result of the dollar’s rise, after the U.S. Federal Reserve dropped interest rates by 25 bps, as anticipated, and signalled two more cuts this year as the job market deteriorated. · Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, expressed caution about additional easing, characterising the action as a risk-management strategy in reaction to a deteriorating labour market. The central bank will evaluate the future trajectory of interest rates “meeting-by-meeting,” he continued. · Due to persistent geopolitical concerns, Fed easing expectations, and robust central bank demand, gold has increased 40% so far this year. · The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are anticipated to maintain policy stability this week, while the Bank of Canada also reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points. Technical Triggers · Gold Oct Futures seems to have topped out, and if it sustains below $3700 (~Rs 109,500), then we could only see further profit booking up to $3650(~Rs 108,000) and $3600 (~Rs 106,500). · Silver Nov Futures also seems to have topped out around $43, the next target is $41(~Rs 123,500). Sell on rallies The Nifty IT index surged 0.92 per cent to 36,780.85 points in morning trade, with all constituent stocks advancing as investors responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut announced overnight. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. The U.S. Fed’s 25 basis points rate cut is expected to have a measured impact on Indian markets. Softer U.S. yields enhance the relative appeal of Indian assets, which could draw interest from global investors into emerging markets. But the wide anticipation of at least a 25 bps cut was already factored in by the market to a great extent. That said, a more decisive driver for market sentiment would be the progress on the U.S.–India trade deal, which would ease some pressures by lowering tariff barriers. Domestically the ongoing momentum is being supported by GST reforms, while the prospect of an agreement with the US. Further, the Fed projections of an additional 50 basis points cut in 2025 ahead, coupled with the previous stated factors would greatly ease the situation and FII positioning for Indian markets. Still, in the near term, sectors with exposure to international borrowings and export-oriented industries could benefit, providing selective opportunities.

NATCO’s Pharma division located in Kothur, Hyderabad, India has now received Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) classifying the facility as “Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI)“ from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Shares traded at Rs 876.75 on the NSE, up 2% .Perspective by Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry on US Fed Announcement “The decision of US Fed to cut the rates by 25bps making it 4.0% from 4.25% is a welcome move for the Gems and Jewelry sector, especially given the current volatility in trade due to the tariff. With US being a large market for exports, the fed cut post the implementation of tariffs will drive momentum in exports by bringing in some relief to the business. In terms of gold, the prices declined in the domestic as well as international markets after setting a new high in India before the Fed rate cut. It is expected that the gold prices in India will further rise though but this can be cushioned if the rupee gains strength against the dollar. Going ahead, we expect gold prices to be elevated with lower U.S yields making the metal more attractive to investors. In the domestic market, the demand is likely to remain steady even with mild price fluctuation, given the festive and wedding season. Prices could hover in the range of INR 1,10,000 to 1,12,000/10 gms in the domestic market and USD 3600 to 3700/Oz in the international markets in the near term.” China’s exports of refined oil products in August rose 8.5% year-on-year, according to customs data, but slowed from July when it recorded the highest monthly total since June 2024. - Reuters The rupee depreciated 16 paise to 88.01 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, as traders assessed the US FED outlook following a rate cut. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first reduction of the year. This decision reflects a cautious approach to supporting the labour market amid increasing employment risks. The dovish stance is expected to lower borrowing costs and encourage consumer spending in the U.S. markets, which could lead to gains in equities, bonds, and real estate. However, some volatility may persist due to internal divisions. In India, the Fed’s actions could attract foreign capital, strengthening the rupee and benefiting stock indices like the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty. This favourable environment may help ease inflationary pressures and provide the RBI room for adjustments, although exporters might face challenges from currency strength. When combined with domestic factors, including the RBI’s earlier interest rate reductions, specifically a 50 basis point cut in June 2025 and another cut in April, as well as GST rate rationalization and various measures to boost consumption, the outlook for India’s economy appears strong. Potential GDP growth is projected to remain steady at around 6.5% to 6.7% for FY2025/26. Given these favourable conditions, several sectors, including Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Information Technology (IT), Metals, and Domestic Consumption (FMCG, Retail, Durables), are positioned for potential gains.

Retail Participation in Cash Segment – A Sharp Decline Retail investors once dominated direct equity trading, but their share in NSE’s cash market has dropped to 34.2% in FY25-26 (till August). This is a sharp fall from the pandemic peak of 45% in FY20-21, when retail enthusiasm was at its highest. Current levels are comparable to 2015-16, highlighting a gradual retreat from direct market dominance. 2. Why Retail Investors are Withdrawing Pandemic Euphoria Faded: During COVID, easy apps and abundant liquidity brought millions of new investors. But many came for quick gains and exited after facing cycles of poor returns. Shift Towards Indirect Routes: Instead of trading themselves, many retail investors now prefer mutual funds, insurance-linked products, and PMS where professionals manage money. Regulatory Tightening: SEBI has raised margin rules, introduced stricter norms, and curbed speculative trading in F&O. Losses in F&O: Data shows most new entrants lost money in F&O, and sharp corrections in many mid- and small-cap stocks further discouraged direct participation. 3. Where Retail Money is Moving Mutual Funds & Systematic Plans (SIPs): Steady inflows suggest retailers are now choosing professional fund managers over self-trading. Insurance & PMS: Increasing reliance on structured, long-term wealth management solutions. Indirect Exposure to F&O: Retailers’ footprint in futures & options rose from 23% in FY15-16 to 27.7% in FY25-26 (till August). 4. Key Risks and Lessons for Retailers Chasing Quick Profits Backfires: Many investors entered for short-term gains but faced losses. The lesson: discipline matters more than thrill. High-Risk Speculation Curbed: Stricter rules may reduce short-term excitement, but they are designed to protect investors from reckless losses. Market Reality Check: Small and mid-cap stocks have fallen 30-40% from peaks, versus only 4-5% in the broader index. This proves that investing without understanding fundamentals can be dangerous. 5. Outlook – A More Mature Market Ahead Experts believe that although curbs may dampen high-risk speculation, they will foster a healthier, long-term investing environment. With retail investors moving towards mutual funds and institutions playing a stronger role, India’s market is slowly shifting to a sustainable growth path. Future success for retailers lies in: Understanding fundamentals rather than speculation. Diversifying via funds instead of only direct stocks. Adopting discipline and patience rather than chasing momentum. Aluminium prices expected to stay high in 2025 due to a weaker dollar and stable Chinese demand. India's top online used car vendors prepare for IPOs exceeding $1 billion, cutting costs and streamlining operations. Bulls Stay in Control, Key Levels to Watch Post Fed Rate Cut The US Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. With the US being the world’s largest economy, this decision has global market implications and early cues are already reflecting in positive US indices and Gift Nifty, hinting at a positive opening for Nifty today. Nifty 50 extended its winning streak on Wednesday, gaining 91.15 points (+0.36%) to close at 25,330.25. The index continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, backed by robust volumes. Technically, the spot remains well above its 9-, 20-, and 50-day EMAs, with the RSI (14) reading at 67 — inching toward the overbought zone. While this does not guarantee a reversal, traders should watch for potential consolidation or a healthy pullback towards the psychological 25,000 level. Such dips could present attractive buy-on-dip opportunities if the bullish bias sustains. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at 25,400 — a breakout above this zone could open doors for 25,500–25,600 levels. On the downside, 25,250 acts as the first line of support, followed by 25,100. For Thursday’s session, the expected range is between 25,470 on the higher side and 25,160 on the lower side if 25,250 fails to hold. In the institutional flow space, FIIs continued their selling streak with net outflows of ₹989.81 crore, while DIIs stepped in aggressively by pumping in ₹2,205.12 crore which provided strong support to the market’s bullish undertone. The U.S. Fed’s 25-bps rate cut marks a pivotal policy shift, lowering borrowing costs and reviving global risk appetite. Growth-sensitive sectors such as housing, tech, and small caps stand to benefit, though banks may face margin compression. A softer dollar also improves the prospects of stronger FII inflows into India. Coupled with consistent DII support and stable technical underpinnings, this development strengthens the case for continued market upside—so long as global cues remain favorable. FII Caution vs DII Confidence FIIs remain cautious, having offloaded ₹11,330.08 crores in the cash market month-to-date. However, their strategic additions in index futures (₹4,727.78 crores) and options (₹6,739.97 crores) reflect hedging activity rather than outright bearishness. Counterbalancing this, DIIs have infused ₹32,892.91 crores, supported by resilient retail SIP flows and confidence in India’s long-term growth story. This steady domestic support has anchored sentiment and offset external nervousness. Open Interest Signals Open Interest data indicates firm resistance around the 25,500–26,000 strike, where rising call OI suggests sellers may assert pressure. At the same time, concentrated put OI at 25,150–25,000 highlights strong defensive positioning, reinforcing the support base. The balance of OI shifts suggests cautious optimism, with market participants hedging while staying positioned for an eventual breakout. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up, as trend in GIFT Nifty suggests a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed in early trade. US markets ended mixed on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points as expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 260.42 points, or 0.57%, to 46,018.32, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points, or 0.10%, to 6,600.35 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 72.63 points, or 0.32%, to 22,261.33. Benchmark indices extended gains for a second consecutive session on Wednesday. At close, the Sensex was up 313.02 points or 0.38 percent at 82,693.71, and the Nifty 50 was up 91.15 points or 0.36 percent at 25,330.25. • Cohance Lifesciences: Jusmiral Holdings to sell 1.9 cr shares, representing 5.1% stake worth about Rs 1,756.2 cr.

Title: Jerome Powell on signs of an AI bubble and an economy leaning too hard on the rich: ‘Unusually large amounts of economic activity’

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. For months, Wall Street commentators have fretted that the artificial intelligence boom looks like a bubble, with capital spending – which some analysts estimate could reach $3 trillion by 2028 – fattening a few mega-cap firms, while lower-income workers suffer from a slack labor market. On Wednesday, they got validation from an unlikely source: the chair of the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell said the U.S. is seeing “unusually large amounts of economic activity through the AI buildout,” a rare acknowledgement from the central bank that the surge is not only outsized, but also skewed toward the wealthy. That imbalance extends beyond markets. Roughly 70% of U.S. economic growth comes from consumer spending, yet most households live paycheck to paycheck. That demand picture has taken on a shape that analysts call K-shaped: while many families cut back on essentials, wealthier households continue to spend on travel, tech, and luxury goods—and they continued to do so in August. For now, the inflation recovery depends heavily on this dynamic remaining in fragile stasis. It’s a fix that works well until it doesn’t, if it could be described as working at all.“[Spending] may well be skewed toward higher-earning consumers,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s latest policy meeting. “There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that.” That skew has become increasingly obvious in markets. Just seven firms — Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla — now make up more than 30% of the S&P 500’s value. Their relentless AI capex is keeping business investment positive, even as overall job growth has slowed to a crawl. Goldman Sachs estimates AI spending accounted for nearly all of the 7% year-over-year gain in corporate capex this spring. The comments underscore a widening concern at the Fed: that while headline GDP growth is holding above 1.5%, the composition of that growth is uneven, unlike previous booms in housing or manufacturing. Powell pointed to “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities” as struggling to find jobs in today’s cooling labor market, even as affluent households continue to spend freely and companies funnel cash into cutting-edge technologies. The imbalance reflects what Powell described as “a low firing, low hiring environment,” where layoffs remain rare but job creation has slowed to a crawl. That dynamic, combined with the concentration of economic gains in AI and among the wealthy, risks deepening inequality, and complicates the Fed’s attempt to balance its inflation and employment mandates. That disconnect risks widening the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. While affluent households continue to spend freely and tech titans pour billions into data centers and chips, revised jobs data show the economy added just 22,000 positions in August, with unemployment edging up to 4.3%. “Unusually large” AI investment may sustain top-line growth, Powell suggested, but it’s doing little to lift the broad labor market.“The overall job finding rate is very, very low,” he said. “If layoffs begin to rise, there won’t be a lot of hiring going on.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin Has Taken Gold’s Role In Today’s World, Eric Trump Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Eric Trump on Tuesday described Bitcoin as a “modern-day gold,” calling it a liquid store of value that can act as a hedge to real estate and other assets. According to reports, the remark came during a TV appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, tied to the launch of American Bitcoin, the mining and treasury firm he helped start. Based on public filings and company summaries, American Bitcoin has accumulated 2,443 BTC on its balance sheet. That stash has been valued in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at recent spot prices. The firm mixes large-scale mining with the goal of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, which it says will help it grow both production and asset holdings over time. Eric Trump’s comments were direct. He told viewers that institutions are treating Bitcoin more like a store of value than a fringe idea, and he warned firms that resist blockchain adoption. The tone was strong at times, and the line about Bitcoin being a modern equivalent of gold was used to frame American Bitcoin’s role as both miner and holder. Eric Trump has said: bitcoin is modern-day gold — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) September 16, 2025 American Bitcoin moved toward a public listing via an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining earlier this year, a deal that kept most of the original shareholders in control and positioned the new entity for a Nasdaq debut. Reports show that mining partner Hut 8 holds a large ownership stake, leaving the Trump family and other backers with a minority share. The listing brought fresh attention and capital to the firm as it began trading under the ticker ABTC. Market watchers say the firm’s public debut highlights two trends: mining companies are trying to grow by both producing and holding Bitcoin, and political ties are bringing more headlines to crypto firms. Some analysts point out that holding large amounts of Bitcoin on the balance sheet exposes a company to price swings, while supporters argue it aligns incentives between miners and investors. Based on coverage of the launch, investors have reacted with both enthusiasm and caution. Supporters praise the prospect of a US-based miner that aims to be transparent and aggressive about building a reserve. Critics point to governance questions, possible conflicts tied to high-profile backers, and the usual risks of a volatile asset being held on corporate balance sheets. Eric Trump’s remark that Bitcoin has taken gold’s role in today’s world reflects both his belief in its value and American Bitcoin’s strategy of mining and holding. Whether that view sticks will depend on how investors and institutions respond in the months ahead. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

September 17, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

ByAntonio Pequeño IV, Forbes Staff. Lyft shares rose as high as 14% Wednesday to a three-year high after the rideshare company announced a partnership with autonomous ride-hailing service Waymo. Lyft shares traded up 12.8% to $22.60 about 20 minutes before market close Wednesday. The surge in share price brings Lyft’s stock to its highest point since May 2022, when it dramatically fell from a post-COVID lockdown boom the year prior. The Lyft and Waymo partnership brings Waymo’s robotaxi service to Nashville, adding on to the company’s service in the cities of Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta and Austin. Lyft will provide vehicle maintenance, infrastructure and depot operations under the agreement. Riders will be able to use Waymo’s robotaxi service first through the company’s app and later through Lyft’s app as the Nashville service grows.

Shares of Uber, Lyft’s ridesharing competitor, fell 4.2% at 2:30 p.m. EDT, erasing gains made in the last week of trading. Uber’s stock is up more than 53% this year. Lyft’s stock has been on a tear since the company announced its second quarter earnings in August, when it missed analyst expectations on revenue ($1.6 billion) and earnings per share ($0.10), but posted $4.5 billion in gross bookings—an all-time high that represented a 12% increase year-over-year. Waymo is looking to expand the market for its autonomous rides next year, with plans to bring its service to Washington, D.C., Miami and New York City. It has also been testing in cities like San Diego, Las Vegas and Houston. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana told The New York Times podcast “Hard Fork” in August “we’re currently giving hundreds of thousands of rides every week and, in all likelihood, by the end of next year, we will be offering around one million rides per week.” Waymo has received $12 billion in investments from parent company Alphabet and other investors, and could see $300 million in ride revenue this year, according to a Forbes estimate. Waymo Is A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity. Google Just Needs To Seize It. (Forbes)

Title: Build Agentic Workflows with OpenAI GPT OSS on Amazon SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-agentic-workflows-with-openai-gpt-oss-on-amazon-sagemaker-ai-and-amazon-bedrock-agentcore/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T19:31:44Z

AWS Blogs OpenAI has released two open-weight models, gpt-oss-120b (117 billion parameters) and gpt-oss-20b (21 billion parameters), both built with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) design and a 128K context window. These models are the leading open source models, according to Artificial Analysis benchmarks, and excel at reasoning and agentic workflows. With Amazon SageMaker AI, you can fine-tune or customize models and deploy with your choice of framework through a fully managed service. Amazon SageMaker Inference gives you the flexibility to bring your own inference code and framework without having to build and maintain your own clusters. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding language and generating content, building real-world agentic applications requires complex workflow management, tool calling capabilities, and context management. Multi-agent architectures address these challenges by breaking down complex systems into specialized components, but they introduce new complexities in agent coordination, memory management, and workflow orchestration. In this post, we show how to deploy gpt-oss-20b model to SageMaker managed endpoints and demonstrate a practical stock analyzer agent assistant example with LangGraph, a powerful graph-based framework that handles state management, coordinated workflows, and persistent memory systems. We will then deploy our agents to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, a unified orchestration layer that abstracts away infrastructure and allows you to securely deploy and operate AI agents at scale. In this solution, we build an agentic stock analyzer with the following key components: The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture. This architecture illustrates a multi-agent workflow hosted on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime running on AWS. A user submits a query, which is handled by a pipeline of specialized agents—Data Gathering Agent, Stock Performance Analyzer Agent, and Stock Report Generation Agent—that are each responsible for a distinct part of the stock evaluation process. These agents collaborate within Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, and when language understanding or generation is required, they invoke a GPT OSS model hosted on SageMaker AI. The model processes the input and returns structured outputs that inform agent actions, enabling a fully serverless, modular, and scalable agentic system using open-source models. Customers who want to customize their models and frameworks can deploy using serverful deployments, but this requires access to GPUs, serving frameworks, load balancers, and infrastructure setup. SageMaker AI provides a fully managed hosting platform that takes care of provisioning the infrastructure with the necessary drivers, downloads the models, and deploys them. OpenAI’s GPT-OSS models are launched with a 4-bit quantization scheme (MXFP4), enabling fast inference while keeping resource usage low. These models can run on P5(H100), P6(H200), and P4(A100) and G6e(L40) instances.The GPT-OSS models are sparse MoE architectures with 128 experts (120B) or 32 experts (20B), where each token is routed to 4 experts with no shared expert. Using MXFP4 for MoE weights alone reduces the model sizes to 63 GB (120B) and 14 GB (20B), making them runnable on a single H100 GPU. To deploy these models effectively, you need a powerful serving framework like vLLM. To deploy the model, we build a vLLM container with the latest version that supports GPT OSS models on SageMaker AI. You can use the following Docker file and script to build the container and push it to a local Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). The recommended approach is to do this directly from Amazon SageMaker Studio, which provides a managed JupyterLab environment with AWS CLI access where you can build and push images to ECR as part of your SageMaker workflow. Alternatively, you can also perform the same steps on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance with Docker installed. After you have built and pushed the container to Amazon ECR, you can open Amazon SageMaker Studio by going to the SageMaker AI console, as shown in the following screenshot. You can then create a Jupyter space or use an existing one to launch JupyterLab and run notebooks. Clone the following notebook and run “Option 3: Deploying from HF using BYOC.” Update the required parameters, such as the inference image in the notebook with the container image. We also provide necessary environment variables, as shown in the following code. After you set up the deployment configuration, you can deploy to SageMaker AI using the following code: You can now run an inference example: For our stock analyzing multi-agent system, we use LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow. Jupyter notebook for the code is located in this github repository. The system comprises three specialized tools that work together to analyze stocks comprehensively: For local testing, you can use a simplified version of the system by importing the necessary functions from your local script. For example: This way, you can iterate quickly on your agent’s logic before deploying it to a scalable platform, making sure each component functions correctly and the overall workflow produces the expected results for different types of stocks. After you have developed and tested your LangGraph framework locally, you can deploy it to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore handles the heavy lifting of container orchestration, session management, scalability and abstracting the management of infrastructure. It provides persistent execution environments that can maintain an agent’s state across multiple invocations. Before deploying our stock analyzer agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, we need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management IAM role with the appropriate permissions. This role allows Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to invoke your SageMaker endpoint for GPT-OSS model inference, manage ECR repositories for storing container images, write Amazon CloudWatch logs for monitoring and debugging, access Amazon Bedrock AgentCore workload services for runtime operations, and send telemetry data to AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch for observability. See the following code: After creating the role, you can use the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Starter Toolkit to deploy your agent. The toolkit simplifies the deployment process by packaging your code, creating the necessary container image, and configuring the runtime environment: When you’re using BedrockAgentCoreApp, it automatically creates an HTTP server that listens on port 8080, implements the required /invocations endpoint for processing the agent’s requirements, implements the/ping endpoint for health checks (which is very important for asynchronous agents), handles proper content types and response formats, and manages error handling according to AWS standards. After you deploy to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you will be able to see the status show as Ready on the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console. After you create the agent, you must set up the agent invocation entry point. With Amazon AgentCore Runtime, we decorate the invocation part of our agent with the @app.entrypoint decorator and use it as the entry point for our runtime. After you deploy the agent to Amazon AgentCore Runtime, you can invoke it using the AWS SDK: After invoking the stock analyzer agent through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you must parse and format the response for clear presentation. The response processing involves the following steps: The system also includes error handling that gracefully handles JSON parsing errors, falls back to plain text display if structured parsing fails, and provides debugging information for troubleshooting parsing issues of the stock analysis response. This formatted output makes it straightforward to review the agent’s decision-making process and present professional stock analysis results to stakeholders, completing the end-to-end workflow from model deployment to meaningful business output: You can delete the SageMaker endpoint to avoid accruing costs after your testing by running the following cells in the same notebook: You can also delete Amazon Bedrock AgentCore resources using the following commands: In this post, we built an end-to-end solution for deploying OpenAI’s open-weight models on a single G6e(L40s) GPU, creating a multi-agent stock analysis system with LangGraph and deploying it seamlessly with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. This implementation demonstrates how organizations can now use powerful open source LLMs cost-effectively with efficient serving frameworks such as vLLM. Beyond the technical implementation, enhancing this workflow can provide significant business value, such as reduction in stock analysis processing time, increased analyst productivity by automating routine stock assessments. Furthermore, by freeing analysts from repetitive tasks, organizations can redirect skilled professionals toward complex cases and relationship-building activities that drive business growth.

Title: Watch These Alphabet Stock Price Levels After Google Parent Joins the $3 Trillion Club
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-alphabet-price-levels-after-google-parent-s-move-into-usd3-trillion-club-11811667
Time Published: 2025-09-17T16:31:48Z
Full Content:
Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom. The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business. Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year. Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for. Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month. While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking. It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring. Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value. When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201). Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201). The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday ahead of a highly anticipated decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The Dow advanced, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Workday (WDAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Investment Management said it took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider and complemented management on its strategy. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared after Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo announced an expanded partnership to bring robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year. Shares of rival ridesharing giant Uber (UBER) slumped. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) climbed following a report China Unicom will purchase its artificial intelligence semiconductors. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid following a report China has blocked the sale of the U.S. company's AI chips to tech companies there. A number of other chipmakers and AI investor favorites, including Broadcom (AVGO), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir (PLTR), also lost ground. Oil and gold futures edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro but lost ground to the pound and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Listen to the Stepchange Show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Welcome to the third episode of the Stepchange Show—where we explore the technologies and systems that have transformed human civilization. Every time you stream a movie, send a text message, scroll a feed, or chat with your favorite AI, you’re touching an invisible, physical empire. We call it the cloud, but it isn’t in the sky. It is astonishingly physical—alive in over 12,000 buildings around the world, consuming almost five percent of U.S. electricity, and running through cables laid across the ocean floor. This is the story of data centers. From the humming punch-card rooms of the 1930s to the Cold War projects that accidentally birthed the internet, and onward to the gigawatt-scale AI factories of today, data centers have quietly become the industrial engine of our era. Six companies—NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—now dominate global markets in part because they command this infrastructure, just as railroads, steel, and oil once defined the fortunes of the last century. Data centers are the machines behind the modern world. They shape commerce, media, communication, and now artificial intelligence, and raise profound questions about energy, water, and climate. Join us as we uncover the physical reality of our digital world.

Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:00): All right, Anay. Well, kids are in school. Anay Shah (00:00:04): Kids are in school. We survived the summer. I love how back to school kind of feels like the beginning of a new year. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:11): It does. I always thought this time of year was the actual new year. Anay Shah (00:00:16): I like that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:28): Welcome to the third episode of the Step Change Show. We're here to cover the stories of human progress. We want to understand the technologies, systems, and infrastructure that shape our world. I'm Ben Eidelson, a co-founder of Step Change Ventures, a fund that invests in the companies that are accelerating today's biggest step changes. I'm based up in Seattle, Washington. Anay Shah (00:00:46): And I'm Anay Shah, fellow co-founder of Step Change Ventures, based in Los Angeles, California. Today we're going to be telling the story of the hyperscale-up of a recent infrastructure: the story of data centers. Every time you stream a movie, send a text message, call a car to pick you up, or talk to what feels like a fully formed computational consciousness, you are touching an invisible physical empire. We call it the cloud, but it isn't in the sky. It lives somewhere very, very real. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:01:20): It lives in nearly 12,000 buildings worldwide, consuming almost 5% of electricity in the U.S. It also lives inside these garden-hose-sized cables that are laid across the darkest parts of the ocean floor. Today we are going to tell the story of this invisible infrastructure—a story that begins in the humming and clattering punch card rooms of the early 1900s, winds through the Cold War projects that accidentally birthed the internet, and leads to the gigawatt-scale AI factories the size of Lower Manhattan that are being built today. Anay Shah (00:01:50): The U.S. stock market is worth around $60 trillion, made up of over 4,000 companies. But there are just six companies at the top—Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—that make up 30% of that market. They are today's railroads, steel, and oil companies, building the modern industrial engine of our time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:02:12): This is the story of data centers. But before we do, just one quick note: We have all of the research links and notes for this episode up at StepChangeShow. And if you are listening to this and you think of a friend or colleague who might enjoy it, please send it over their way. All of this is a new endeavor for us, and we appreciate it getting into the hands—or rather ears—of folks who may dig it. All right, so data centers. Anay Shah (00:02:36): So Ben, I was recently reading an article saying these new technologies are saving work for everyone nowadays. Pretty soon we'll have nothing to do at all. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:02:44): That's right. I think they were saying that we have some new electronic brain that's going to make most workers obsolete. Anay Shah (00:02:49): Right. But the CEO behind one of these technologies quickly countered, saying that it was a way to save time, not replace jobs. He said it was a small tool to help great minds benefit mankind. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:03:00): Was this the CEO of Anthropic, OpenAI, or maybe Google? Anay Shah (00:03:04): You might think so, but no. This was Thomas J. Watson Sr., the original leader of IBM. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:03:11): So, IBM, the computational powerhouse of the last century. Long before we had the Googles, Amazons, Metas, and Microsofts, there was Big Blue IBM. And long before IBM ever built an electronic computer, they were doing computation of a different sort. Anay Shah (00:03:32): And if you walked into a large company back in the 1930s, you might find yourself in one of their windowless rooms, humming and clattering like a small factory. There'd be long rows of metal cabinets, whirring gears, and clerks feeding stacks of stiff paper cards into these behemoth machines. Each card was a sliver of information: an employee's hours, an invoice, maybe a customer's address. But together, they formed the first centralized nerve center for corporate data. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:05): And I think that's why we argue that those rooms, with those cards of information being processed on these devices that were doing computing, are the first real data centers. Anay Shah (00:04:17): That machine has quite an interesting history, born to solve a government problem: the problem of the U.S. census. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:26): It's wild. The 1880 census data was collected in 1880, and it took seven years before it was tabulated. They realized it just was not working at human computation scale anymore. Anay Shah (00:04:37): And so one man, Herman Hollerith, had an invention to solve this. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:42): He observed the way railroad conductors checked tickets, noting that these were papers with punched-out holes that ultimately stored and represented information. If you could build a machine that could count the number of punch holes, you could then do computation at scale without needing humans to count markdowns on a form. Anay Shah (00:05:05): That's right. These cards stored information, and then you could have machines compute off of them. The 1890 census was the machine's first big break. Even with a population 25% larger than the decade before, it was completed in two years instead of more than seven years, and it came $5 million under budget. That's not something a new technology could typically achieve for a government. So, fast forward to Watson. He sees the punch card machine and understands what it can do. By the mid-1920s, he's convinced. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:05:37): So by 1924, he rebranded the company International Business Machines. Anay Shah (00:05:42): A much more fitting name than CTR. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:05:47): Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. Anay Shah (00:05:50): "There is no limit for this tabulating business," he told his executives in 1927. He doubled down, selling off all the other less promising lines of business and pouring the company's resources into the tabulating division. They designed a proprietary 80-column IBM card that only worked on IBM machines, which became the IBM card—a sort of early-days lock-in where customers who wanted to use the machines had to buy the cards. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:06:22): Everyone obsesses over the Gillette razor blade business model, but the IBM card was not only how you did the computation, but it also stored information and became your record-keeping method inside businesses running on these IBM machines. Anay Shah (00:06:35): Once you put invoices, time cards, and all of that information onto the IBM card, you're not migrating it off. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:06:41): It's on a piece of paper. Anay Shah (00:06:42): Yeah, that's right. So now you've produced a very steady stream of revenue alongside selling the tabulator machine. The timing for this was perfect. This is the late '20s, early '30s. The New Deal brought in a massive government focus around record-keeping. In 1935, the Social Security Administration signed a contract with IBM, requiring millions of their cards and machines to process benefits and print checks. One of their New York plants was soon printing 10 million cards per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:07:14): It's amazing. Anay Shah (00:07:15): And within a couple decades, most large companies had punch card rooms. They had various machines they used to sort, tabulate, and store financial information, payroll information, employee information, customer information—everything you could think of. In order to manage that, they'd hire clerks and technical specialists to operate and maintain it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:07:36): It's easy to take for granted, but this was the first time a company, its accounting, and its invoicing could be calculated at this scale. Think about what was going on in this era: companies were starting to scale in new ways. More global trade was also starting to happen. Thomas Watson Sr. ended up very interested in diplomacy, traveling around the world trying to preach that commerce across borders would create peace. Unfortunately, this backfired. He did a lot of commerce with Germany in the lead-up to the Holocaust, and there are many stories around IBM's computational power being used to help Germans with record-keeping. Ultimately, this product was foundational to so much of the scale of this era, including the scale of war. Every time there was a war or a big government project, regardless of which country was fighting, they needed IBM machines to do calculations. Anay Shah (00:08:34): This was the way to process and store information. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:08:38): But it was all still cards and mechanical switches, ultimately. Anay Shah (00:08:42): And rooms full of paper. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:08:44): Rooms of paper. So everyone was running on punch cards. What was this thing? What was this room? What should we call it? Anay Shah (00:08:50): This is where we're going to put our stake in the ground and say the earliest data centers came out of the IBM punch card data center. The easiest way to understand it is: it's a physical space or a collection of facilities designed to house and operate an organization's data and computing infrastructure. You can think of it as primarily storing information, computing information, and over time, connecting and allowing for the communication of information. At its basic core, a data center in the evolution we're going to talk about from the mid-1900s to the present day is the physical space around storage, computing, and connectivity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:09:33): At this moment, IBM was already a growing company of import, right? Doing global international business. By 1945, they had around 25,000 employees and annual revenue of approximately $140 million. But something was about to change, and that was also coming out of the war. World War II was this big moment of government investment in R&D. One of the things they often found themselves doing was calculating artillery firing tables, which took into account the wind speed, weather, and all these different factors to figure out where they should shoot artillery. There were teams of human computers, clerks who were doing mechanical calculation to figure things out. But that was a bottleneck. So the army funded a team at the University of Pennsylvania to build the first real electronic computer, a machine that could crank through those calculations an order of magnitude faster. That became the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, also known as ENIAC. Anay Shah (00:10:33): This was all about math. It was focused on calculating numbers and producing mathematical results that would help them, in this case, be more efficient in war planning. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:10:44): Yeah, I mean, they didn't have the... Anay Shah (00:10:45): TI-83 or the games that go on it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:10:48): It, or the games that go on it. They didn't have Tetris. So they needed a calculator that could go faster than the people who were a bottleneck at this point. The ENIAC had no mechanical parts that slowed its operation. It took up nearly a 2,000-square-foot room, but it did operate over 1,000 times faster than any previous computational device. It could execute 5,000 additions per second. At this time, IBM, with its commercial product—the quickest punch card machine—could complete just four additions a second. So it wasn't an order of magnitude faster; it was three orders of magnitude faster. Anay Shah (00:11:25): Four additions per second to 5,000 additions per second. This seems like something mathematicians and CEOs privy to this would think, "Oh, I can see the future." But no. A distinguished Harvard mathematician dismissed the idea as foolishness, saying there would be no big market for computers. He believed that the country would need maybe half a dozen, mainly for military and scientific research. Our friend Thomas J. Watson Sr. said general-purpose computers had nothing whatsoever to do with IBM or IBM's mainline of equipment and profitability. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:11:59): But Watson's stubbornness to stay wedded to the past was only matched and maybe outdone by his son's stubbornness to push the company forward. Anay Shah (00:12:09): Runs in the family, but takes a different shape. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:12:12): This is a father-and-son story for the ages. Thomas Watson Jr. eventually fought in the war, came back, and was ready to take his seat as a leader inside IBM. He viewed electronics as the future of the company, and this became the intergenerational battle for the control of IBM. Thomas Watson Jr. saw that there was a future for the company in electronics and wanted to push it that way. Anay Shah (00:12:38): There's some interesting parent-child psychology where you can see him completely frustrated and angry that his father's not going to jump on what he thinks is very clearly the future. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:12:50): IBM did do a wartime project with Harvard mathematician Howard Aiken that was a kind of hybrid electromechanical vacuum-tube machine. They followed that with their first machine that they really wanted to demonstrate to the public after the war. This was called the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC). This was in 1948. They showed that in a Madison Avenue showroom, right in the middle of Manhattan, so that people could walk by and see this thing computing. Anay Shah (00:13:20): And to see this thing, these machines were still the size of rooms. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:13:25): And it was fast, not by today's standards, but by those days, it was very fast. It didn't have any memory in the sense that we were used to computers today having memory, but it had this punched paper tape as a form of storage. Despite Thomas Watson Sr. not liking this as the new business, he didn't mind the company getting some PR points for it. They'd send reporters down to watch the machine do computation. This is the moment when the press said, "Pretty soon no one's going to have a job to do as a result of this electronic brain." Anay Shah (00:13:54): The electronic brain that would displace workers. And so, in 1951, IBM's longtime customer, the U.S. Census Bureau, went with Univac instead of IBM tabulators for its next census. Thomas Watson Jr. recalls this moment, saying, "My God, Univac is smart enough to start taking all the civilian business away!" This is really what shakes IBM to once again reinvent itself. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:14:22): You go back to 1880, 1890. This whole invention was for the census problem. And that problem gets harder: more people, more things you want to know about people, and more factors you want to track. And so, that is actually a perfect test bed for computation at this time. Here comes the ENIAC team, now commercialized with Univac, and that wakes IBM right up. Anay Shah (00:14:41): And this company's been growing, right? IBM, in 1940, was doing about $45 million in revenue with 12,000 employees. And a decade later, they're doing $250 million in revenue with 30,000 employees. And if you're betting the company on a new direction, things could go south for a lot of people. It's a big responsibility for Watson Jr. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:15:02): And they pushed forward. And so, out of these early computer experiments, they finally built their first commercial product, which was the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine. This is the first real machine where they thought, "Hey, we're going to build more than one of these, and we're going to sell some of them. We're actually going to try and make this into a business, not just a research project." Anay Shah (00:15:20): And as we'll see with some of the companies closer to the present day, they had an installed base of customers; they had a sales machine. And so, they started this business line, and within five years, they had 85% of the computer market. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:15:34): That's right. So, that team that invented the first vacuum tube computer in the ENIAC and then the Univac, they got outrun by the better commercial go-to-market sales machine that, if you remember, IBM was founded with. So, who was buying these things, and how many did they sell? Well, the 701 was still a pretty bespoke product. They sold 19. These were going to National Labs, the Weather Bureau, and a lot of aerospace firms that were doing a lot of calculations. And the whole business model was actually not around buying these machines; it was an extension of the tabulating business model that IBM had always had, where they wanted you to lease the machine, rent it, and buy punch cards. Anay Shah (00:16:08): We got hardware as a service. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:16:10): Exactly. It was a beautiful business model. The era of the '50s for IBM was going from this research-centered product to what I'd consider their Model T. So, in this era, they built the first disk drive. They started using tape in addition to punch cards. They wrote Fortran, which is the first real kind of modern programming language where you could write words, and it would get translated into computer instructions by the end of the decade. In 1959, they launched the IBM 1401, which was available to thousands of companies. And they ended up selling around 12,000 of those machines. They exited the decade with a real... Anay Shah (00:16:45): computing business, and they're dominating the market. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:16:48): So, that first machine shipped 19 systems. They had another machine that shipped 123. After that, they had the first transistorized Model T. The 1401 crossed over 10,000 units. From 1950 to 1962, IBM's revenue rose tenfold, from $260 million to $2.6 billion. And their headcount went from 30,000 employees to almost 130,000 employees. Woo! Anay Shah (00:17:12): And so, what else is happening right now? We're in the 1950s; World War II has ended. The Cold War is getting colder. And we find that the Soviet Union's long-range nuclear-armed bombers are able to cross the Arctic and reach American cities in a matter of hours. So, this makes the decision window to detect and intercept down to two minutes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:17:36): It's easy to forget, but the Cold War was primarily a technological arms race. Who's going to get there faster if something's going down? If the Soviet Union launches these bombers, how quickly can we respond, know about it, and then respond? And our Air Force and our defense systems were not designed for that speed. Anay Shah (00:17:53): Yeah, every threat forced a technology upgrade, forced our government to respond, to invest. We had a laboratory project at MIT that, in 1951, could process live radar data in real time, proving that automation could close this gap that we were seeing in national security. The challenge was: how do you take this radar research prototype and turn it into a 24/7 machine that can operate at government scale? And this is a moment that became the largest computing project to date. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:18:23): Thomas Watson Jr. saw this, and he knew that they needed to win this contract. IBM actually had a policy of essentially making only 1% profit on any defense work, which they kept throughout this. But they said this would push them to the future. And so, the contract awarded in 1954 became one of the largest contracts ever, worth more than $500 million in 1950s dollars. Around $5.5 billion in today's dollars. And so, how did it work? What did it do at full deployment when they got there in the 1960s? It was a network that spanned 27 different centers, where each center had a pair of special IBM computers designed for this. In case one of them was being serviced or down, the other one would become primary. So they built redundancy into the network. And the scale was unprecedented. In total, it was 56 computers. These were acre-sized floors, with multi-megawatt power draw to these systems. And they were connected—connected over early modems. This was the moment that really drove the production of the modem, where you could actually have data sent over telephone lines. And so, they would lease special lines between these centers. Anay Shah (00:19:32): And these centers have characteristics that we're going to talk about more. You have redundancy built into this; you have building-level scale; you've got multiple facilities networked together. These end up being a lot of the same characteristics that drive data center growth and evolution decades later. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:19:52): That's right. And I feel like there's the scale of it, but I think the connectivity of this system is the difference. You have storage; you have compute, which was happening; but now you had connection and communication, because you want this center over here to respond to information that was computed over there. And so, this moment in history—the SAGE system, I think—is the first real time that machines were communicating with each other. Pretty big moment. Anay Shah (00:20:17): So, once we're able to do this in government, it's going to catch the eyes of other industries. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:23): The airlines had seen the SAGE project take off, and they were sitting there with a new problem on their hands. This was the '60s. Air flight was booming, and the way that reservations got processed was absolutely insane. You would call your travel agent; your travel agent would call the airline; and the airline would have to run clerks around, pulling cards out to book a seat. Supposedly it took up to 90 minutes. Anay Shah (00:20:49): Well, you had to figure out who had the middle seat in Row 17. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:52): Who had the middle seat, exactly. Anay Shah (00:20:54): How were you going to figure that out without looking up the card? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:56): As American Airlines scaled to a real operational scale, it started to break down. So, they reached out to IBM, and they kicked off this project that would be known as Sabre. It was essentially a commercial version of the SAGE system. Two IBM mainframes were purpose-built, and would be connected over phone lines. Those systems would house the source of truth around the reservations. And there would be terminals. These weren't terminals with screens; these were terminals with paper where you'd still have a travel agent, but they would be querying over the terminal what seats were available. And things would be booked automatically. So, it would go from 90 minutes to seconds at a terminal. And it removed the clerk in the middle. This set the stage for e-commerce. This was the first time, I think, you were buying something over a computer. Anay Shah (00:21:44): You had 90 minutes to do a reservation, now down to seconds. And this scaled American Airlines operations by the mid-'60s to be able to do a full 40,000 reservations per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:21:55): Insane. This system continues to this day to be part of the backbone of airline booking. It's quite an amazing foundational moment where commerce is happening between data centers. And so, they were running airlines; they were doing these major government projects. Businesses were now buying the 1401 machine off the shelves. But there was a different problem. Entering the mid-'60s, all of these mainframes had their own accessories. There was no compatibility. So, in 1964, they launched the System/360. And that turned this chaotic, messy, ad hoc world of different mainframe models into a platform. It was essentially one architecture; you could choose how powerful you wanted... Anay Shah (00:22:38): it to be, buy your base package, and then feature it up based on what you need. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:22:42): That's right. And so, for facility planners, they could now plan a room and a facility, and then be able to scale up the machine as needed. I believe roughly $5 billion of investment in R&D was spent in this era. Anay Shah (00:22:55): Another "bet the company" moment. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:22:57): And it worked. They were shipping thousands per month of these devices in the '60s. And so, if you zoom out and look across the '50s and '60s, as we talked about earlier. From the '50s to '62, they scaled to $2.6 billion. By 1970, they were doing $7.5 billion in annual revenue and had a team of 270,000 employees. Anay Shah (00:23:19): In today's dollars, that's $62 billion in revenue. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:23:23): And the market noticed. IBM was king at that moment. In 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8% of the total U.S. stock market. It almost feels like an unprecedented thing to say that today Nvidia is currently 7% of the U.S. stock market. Anay Shah (00:23:44): These mainframes became part of the zeitgeist. They became part of a cultural milieu because they were often nicknamed "the glass houses." You'd have the mainframes and their operators in an enclosed room. And as we mentioned before, you'd have windows and glass walls around it because you wanted to show off how automated your systems were, how advanced your company was. There was a recognition that these "glass houses"—these mainframes—were powering the billions of dollars of revenue from their enterprise customers. And so, the security, the operational control, the climate control, and cleanliness... It was all part of this cultural moment where mainframes and these early data centers became a meaningful part of how our society and economy ran. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:24:34): If any company was using it effectively, they had more demand for use than they had supply for the computer. And so, oftentimes, people would be sitting there waiting for their information to come back, for their computation to run. Sometimes it would be a day or longer, so the utilization was pretty high. But there was this long interactive latency problem. And an invention that echoes through in multiple ways to this day changed the fundamental way that computing was thought of: from this single-threaded "I'm only working on one problem at once" to "No." The job is to make sure my hardware is as utilized as possible. As a machine, I don't care whether or not it's the same problem from the same person. I just need to be calculating. Anay Shah (00:25:20): I need to be operating all the time to utilize my capacity. It can be for this problem; it can be for that problem. You can slot them in and out; it doesn't matter. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:25:29): That's right. And so, a team at MIT in the early '60s developed what was called CTSS, the Compatible Time-Sharing System, and turned it onto the campus in 1963. And so, students could sit there with electric typewriters and interact with this machine, multiple users at the same time, and feel like they had control over the computer. Anay Shah (00:25:52): It felt like it was your own. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:25:53): And this was a huge moment. This was the first time there were logins, users, files, and instant feedback. And so, it was revelatory to be there in the mid-'60s, experiencing that after the idea of a computer was just this operated thing by someone else. Anay Shah (00:26:09): That's right. You had to queue up, get in line, hand over your data to the operators—the specialists—who would then go and do their thing, and you would sit and wait. Now you're interacting. It's you and the computer. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:26:22): And the way this worked was that you didn't obviously have monopoly control over the computer. The computer was switching what problem it was working on, depending on what free cycles it had. The human perception is, "Oh, how can a computer do that?" Well, the computer is operating at a much faster frequency than we're able to realize. Even if it's something as simple as responding to a keystroke, there are plenty of milliseconds in between my keystroke and your keystroke for the computer to respond and then switch back to the other problem. And as we'll see later in this story, this notion of intelligently slicing up the hardware and utilizing it becomes the backbone of everything in how the cloud and data centers are architected today. And it started with this timesharing innovation. Well, we had these mainframes that had taken over the business world, and timesharing. So, multiple people could be on a campus connected to that mainframe, feeling like they had their own computer. They were still fully disconnected from anyone else in the world. They were still islands onto themselves. So yes, now on this island, multiple people could be there, but it's not like you could go visit the next-door island. What are we missing? Anay Shah (00:27:27): It's something we take quite for granted. Many people in different places, but working on the same system at the same time. Now remember, we are in the late 1950s, in the Cold War, and Eisenhower wanted to ensure that the U.S. would not be blindsided by a technological surprise. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:27:47): There's this particular moment right when everyone looked up in the sky and for the first time, a man-made thing was floating in space, and that's Sputnik. The fact that the Russians beat us to the skies with Sputnik kicked off, I think, a level of panic from a geopolitical standpoint that's hard to connect to today. Anay Shah (00:28:07): And so, after the panic of Sputnik, Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA. And in those years, ARPA was pouring money into space, into missiles, into computing. And we wanted to ensure, in this nuclear-armed world, that weapons could not destroy a centralized command system. And so, the network itself needed to be decentralized. This need to ensure reliability combined with a slightly more mundane problem that Bob Taylor faced when he was at his office in the Pentagon: he was working at three terminals. He had one machine connected to MIT, another connected to UC Berkeley, and a third for a different research system altogether. And he could talk to any of them, but never at the same time. So he was rolling his chair back and forth, and he's quoted saying, "We ought to find a way to connect all of these different machines." He told his boss. After a 20-minute meeting, Taylor walked out with a million-dollar budget and a simple mandate: to make it happen. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:29:10): And we won't go into every moment and step because the ARPANET itself is quite a story. But I think a couple of innovations set the stage for the Internet in a really important way. One is the concept of packet switching. If you think about a phone line, AT&T built its whole business on this idea: you're going to connect a phone call between two people, and there's going to be a circuit that connects those two phones together. This is called circuit switching. But there's this crazy idea: if you want that resilient system so that if one node goes out, the next thing doesn't go out, you need to route things around in different ways and not be dependent on the one route you have. So, you need to have more of a spiderweb-like network to say, "Well, from here to here, there are actually five, or ideally 50 or 5,000, ways to get between those two points." And to do that, you need a flexible communication system. And so, the idea is to break up information into packets—little pieces of mail that would get sent from one node to another. Different packets could even take different routes, but on the other side, someone would reassemble them into the message. Anay Shah (00:30:15): It's the same singular message, broken up into many, many different pieces and routed through many, many different pathways. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:30:24): It's funny, I hadn't thought about this until we connected to the timesharing story, but it's actually about better utilization of the network. In a circuit-switched mode, you have this direct line; you and I have a direct line together, and you have a direct line to someone else. That line is usually empty. It's pretty hard to fully utilize and build out the circuit-switched thing because the phone call ends, and you think, "Okay, now it's just sitting there unused." In packet switching, packets are finding their way through this wild world. So, a lot of skepticism obviously came from AT&T, which said, "If you want to have two computers talk to each other, we'll build the phone lines, and you can run them." But a crack team that had kind of spun out of MIT—this company, Bolt, Baranek and Newman—latched onto this packet switching model and ran forward. And the core thing that they needed to build was what was called the Interface Message Processor, or IMP. This was ultimately the router that would sit in front of the host machine. Universities like MIT and Berkeley would have these mainframes. But to connect those machines together, there would need to be these nodes that would sit in front of them and be able to build this network. And so, BBN used a Honeywell minicomputer that was fridge-sized, cost about $80,000, and built the logic around packet switching and rolled this out. There were a lot of engineering heroics that went into getting the first machine ready. But then it was time. Anay Shah (00:31:47): Almost 55 years ago, a small group of grad students gathered at UCLA to wait for the machine to be rolled off the truck, champagne in hand, and were able to celebrate the arrival of the first IMP. The second one was delivered to Stanford weeks later. And the prophetic first message, as the story goes, was meant to be "login," right? You now have users that can log in, but after inputting the first two letters, it crashed. And so, the first message was simply "lo," "lo." Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:32:19): So close to "lol." And, of course, what is a network with two connections? Pretty limited. But then they rolled out UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah, and then they were just rolling out new IMPs to the large universities, month over month. Anay Shah (00:32:34): And these became nodes—almost a new node every month. And then every new node that came on the network amplified the value. Because now it's not just bidirectional communication; it's multilateral communication. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:32:47): So, they were building all this logic to do the resilient routing, to do the discovery of devices, and everything that you needed to do that. And of course, the original pitch was, "Hey, we've funded as a government all these expensive computers at all these research universities. Let's drive utilization." Maybe one team has a special program for doing something; another team has a special program for doing something. Let's let the departments connect. Anay Shah (00:33:07): One unexpected application really bubbled to the top that the researchers discovered. Quick, asynchronous messages were often more valuable than logging into someone else's system to run the code. And in 1972, ARPA's Bob Kahn said, "Everyone really uses this thing for electronic mail." And the network's purpose had quietly shifted from sharing machines to connecting people in the form of email. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:33:36): It's wild how as soon as you have enough connectivity, it's always the killer app. The killer app is always people communicating at a distance. Anay Shah (00:33:45): That's right. People wanting to do what we are biologically programmed to do, which is connect with other humans. And as sophisticated as these machines were, it was the simple act of asynchronous communication that became the killer app. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:34:02): And more people wanted it. There were new ways to connect within your local network over these terminals, so then you could connect into the broader network. It was no longer just about wanting access to a terminal to access the machine on your campus; it was about wanting a terminal so you could email your friends at the other campus. Sounds like an early social network that we'll get to later. And so the expansion continued. By 1972, there were 29 nodes. By 1975, over 50. Anay Shah (00:34:27): And some of these connections weren't just from university to university. We were now leaping oceans. It was clumsy, but we were able to go over the Atlantic Ocean from a node in Virginia to the one in Cornwall, England. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:34:41): There was some story where they came back from some conference in England and someone had left their electric shaver behind. Anay Shah (00:34:47): It was the middle of the night, so in England it was 3 o'clock in the morning. But he knew that his colleague was a workaholic, so he sent off a message at 3 o'clock in the morning, England time, to see if this person was awake. And he was. He saw that he was logged on and he's like, "Hey, did I leave my electric razor there?" Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:35:01): "Can you get my razor, please?" And it all worked. It was phenomenal. So, by the early 1980s, other research networks started to pop up in the US and elsewhere. People were like, "Oh, this ARPANET thing is pretty cool. We're going to build our own." There was DECnet, there was an IBM Net, there were various nets that companies and other research groups started to stand up. They had a new challenge: "We want to talk to everyone on any of these networks, and how are we going to do that?" And these IMPs were not designed for that. They had presumed there was only one network they were trying to build out. And so Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were involved in ARPANET, figured out what they needed to build was a common language to figure out addressing: where to send a packet of mail. And then also, the control protocol for sending information, to make sure duplicate packets weren't sent. And so this became TCP/IP: TCP for the Transmission Control Protocol, and IP for the Internet Protocol. You can think of IP as solving the addressing problem. You might be familiar with your IP address, which then communicates through routers what you're looking for, and who you're trying to get the packet to. And then TCP is the reliable way that a packet gets acknowledged. "Hey, this little chunk of information has arrived." It's like certified mail. Anay Shah (00:36:16): Like signing for my package. I have an address, so the package knows where to go. And then I signed for it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:36:21): "And I don't need you to send me the package again, because I got it." And so this combination became the backbone for connecting all of these networks together, and ultimately the backbone for the next stage of not the ARPANET, but the Internet – a network of networks. In 1983, they took every ARPANET host and said they needed to move to TCP/IP. That switch, on January 1, 1983, became the framework for the modern-day internet: many networks, all speaking the same language, able to connect. Anay Shah (00:36:54): And that's where we have the advent of the .com, .edu, and .gov, because we now had standard protocols for multiple nets to communicate together. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:37:06): 20.3.1.72 doesn't have the same ring as pets.com. Anay Shah (00:37:11): Pets.com, an important one, but we're not quite there yet. No, but by the mid-1980s, as Ben mentioned, there were multiple nets now connected. And ARPANET itself was showing its age. By 1990, it became apparent that the ARPANET needed to be decommissioned. But the work it had done, the ideas of decentralized networking, packet switching, and open protocols had firmly taken root. Research institutions and large organizations had firmly established how to exchange messages. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:37:41): So they were able to send files back and forth, maybe send each other's research papers and data sets. But this was not a thing with a web browser yet. We needed a structure around documents. And so Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN in Switzerland, proposed the document structure that would become the application-layer infrastructure of the World Wide Web. Anay Shah (00:38:01): And so the network that started off as a Cold War research project in response to looking up at the sky and seeing the Russians launch Sputnik, had now become the public and commercial Internet – an open highway for data, and the foundation upon which we would build the modern data center economy. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:38:18): So we now have this expanding network, but the computing on this network was still this terminal-based interaction between a terminal and a mainframe that then connected to the network, or a terminal and a minicomputer which connected to the network. And I think it's worth saying a bit more about minicomputers, which were both what became that IMP device and also a primary source of connection. These were not something that you'd buy for your house. They still were the cost of maybe a car when they first came out, but they were much more accessible than a big IBM mainframe, a room-sized computer. And so the company, Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, launched the first minicomputers in the mid-60s. A lot of what innovated on the minicomputer was software like Unix, C programming, and sockets, and all these foundational innovations that would later echo through to today. But there was room for a computer that a normal person could buy. Anay Shah (00:39:11): On one fateful day, January 1975, the cover of Popular Electronics magazine showcased the Altair 8800, a machine you could buy at home for $439, or $1,500 souped up, to run your own code. And there were a few hobbyists that went to the newsstand and picked up this magazine. Two in particular saw the cover and decided to do something about it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:39:42): And so Bill Gates and Paul Allen, famously, when they were at Lakeside High School in Seattle, they had access to a computer and a terminal, and they would spend hours and hours programming. But that's different than having one in your own house that you can play with. And so when they saw this come out, it was immediately clear that this was a moment when computing had gotten cheap enough that a normal person could afford their own personal computer, or PC. Anay Shah (00:40:06): And you could see that if the first one was released at $450, it was only a matter of time before that would become accessible to more and more people. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:40:16): Microsoft formed immediately to sell a BASIC compiler for this device. The Apple II launched in 1977, which kicked off the PC wave for many folks, and it paired with VisiCalc in 1979. So, all of a sudden, you had a killer app – a spreadsheet – that wasn't just for home use, but now had a corporate function, driving the purchase of these PCs. And so someone could model a budget without needing to connect to the mainframe down the hall. Anay Shah (00:40:43): I can stay at my desk and run my finance operations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:40:47): That's right. And IBM, while not the first here, was actually pretty quick to realize there was a problem for them. Right. If everyone is doing all the computation on their desk, they're not going to need the mainframe down the hall anymore. The glass house had been shattered. So they kicked off a skunkworks project. It was actually pretty amazing. They isolated it outside of the New York region, down in Boca Raton. They said this team would use off-the-shelf parts to design an IBM PC. In 1981, they built and launched the IBM PC, and they licensed MS-DOS from Microsoft, which had been founded six years earlier, as the core operating system. They thought hardware was the business, but time would show them to be incorrect. A bunch of IBM-compatible devices, including Compaq and others, flooded the market through the 80s. So prices fell. Hardware became a commodity, and Microsoft, with DOS and then Windows, became the Wintel duopoly that ultimately took the mindshare and market from IBM. Anay Shah (00:42:00): That's amazing. You got Lotus 1-2-3 dominating spreadsheets. You've got WordPerfect. I remember using that for word processing. And then Microsoft comes along and says, "I'm going to bundle all this into Office" and really took the cake. So productivity was through the roof, and we were able to do more personally than we could ever do before. And the way we collaborated? It was that magic floppy disk. We were able to hand that back and forth and keep on rolling. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:42:21): And that's great, right? Until it's not. Anay Shah (00:42:24): Until it's not. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:42:25): You want to work with someone across a big building? You're going to run them a floppy disk? And what if they have a different version? It's a mess. I think the "personal" in personal computing started to become a hindrance here. So we needed to connect these devices as well. Enter the invention of Ethernet and IBM's Token Ring, which wired the floors and connected these PCs into a corporate network. And a new set of companies emerged. Novell, building NetWare, actually turned a server into a hub for shared disks and printers. You had a PC on your desk, and if there was a printer room and you wanted to print, you'd have a different computer. That was a specialized PC that we'd call a server, connected to that printer or to shared storage. Now we were able to access files and print over a network. A whole company, Novell – which at some point was actually the second-largest software manufacturer after Microsoft – Anay Shah (00:43:23): Wow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:43:23): was booming in this era. Microsoft, doing what they do very well, responded by building a network-connected operating system – eventually Windows NT and other services – so that you could do it all within Microsoft's ecosystem. Anay Shah (00:43:37): So throughout our conversations, a lot of the OGs in this industry pointed to this moment as the introduction of the client-server era. What does that mean? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:43:46): It means an application was really split in two. You had your computer sitting there on your desk running as the client and accessing a central database or a server in the back room. A bunch of technologies came up to support this, from Unix servers to ERP systems to Windows NT. But now, all of a sudden, you would think about an application as networked from design, where you'd have local client software that could use the best capabilities of the local PC, connected to the server. Not across the world, but the server in the server room, on site. Anay Shah (00:44:20): What was that server down the hall or in the other room or across the world? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:44:25): Most notably, this was the era when the architecture of the personal computer was adopted. This included the x86 (Intel-based) architecture or the Sun workstation architecture. Increasingly, those would become the servers that could run these applications. This was a notable shift, again, from the IBM mainframe era. It got to the point where someone selling your company an application would sell you an appliance, which was really a package of the software and the hardware together. So you ended up with a sprawl of different appliances that were being managed, all serving different functions, all written with their own bespoke software and operating systems. So, while the functionality was amazing, people became very inefficient. Anay Shah (00:45:10): Up until this point, there was a culture and an ethos among data processing professionals that put conservation as the highest ethical principle. To waste a CPU cycle or a byte of memory was embarrassing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:45:23): I think part of it was that they had gotten cheap enough; these servers, which would have been $10,000 a month to rent just 10 or 15 years prior, had now gotten cheap enough. And it wasn't unreasonable to have them sitting there idle at the same time. In a macro sense, this inefficiency later created the space and value for the evolution of time-sharing into virtualization, where we asked, "Why can't we run these applications on one box? Why do they all need their own box sitting there waiting for a command?" Anay Shah (00:45:49): That's right. If a box was not being maximally utilized by a single client, share the box. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:45:56): We will do a whole episode on how that came to be. But this was still an era of deep innovation, particularly concerning redundancy. You had RAID arrays, which provided redundant storage, and backup tape libraries that were off-site, because you still had these massive points of failure. Your company server, which might be your system of record for your customers, was sitting there in the closet. I heard from someone who ran some of it at REI at one point that they had a flood near their headquarters, and they were like, "Well, the website's going to go down, we're going to lose all this business." So this model was not designed for scale and redundancy in a major way. So, to make this moment concrete – of just how computing power and connectivity was starting to shift – let's talk about a deeply innovative retail company that, no, is not Amazon. We're talking about the OGs of major retail and scale. It's Walmart. Anay Shah (00:46:50): That's right. So, you're at the register at your neighborhood Walmart location: you scan the toothpaste, the barcode beeps. Within seconds, a satellite dish behind the store sends that transaction to the sky and over to Bentonville, Arkansas, where they're hosting their mainframe computer to record the sale. A few minutes later, a massive data warehouse would update how many tubes of toothpaste you had just bought. Then, perhaps before the end of the day, Procter & Gamble's factory would receive an update that they needed to make more toothpaste. This was the cutting edge of retail in the late 80s, and Walmart made a massive decision to take this a step further, truly driving innovation across the retail industry. They invested $24 million to build their own private satellite network linking all Walmart stores to headquarters. This was fairly unprecedented at the time, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:47:43): It was the largest private satellite network. Anay Shah (00:47:46): That had been built, and it created a unified, real-time machine. So any single event that happened within the Walmart ecosystem rode on this private network, enabling them to mine their data in a way that was unheard of before. By mining their sales data – which could now be collected in real time across all Walmart stores over their private satellite network – they discovered that when hurricanes approached, the sale of Pop-Tarts increased 7x over their normal rate. Having spent a summer working in Bentonville, Arkansas, I can tell you this is deep in their DNA. They are constantly looking at signals like this. Specifically, they discovered that it was the Strawberry Pop-Tart that was most in demand before a storm. This led to the legendary insight of meteorologists predicting a severe weather event, and Walmart stocking their affected stores with pallets of Strawberry Pop-Tarts. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:48:43): It makes me wonder if the reverse is possible. It's like, instead of checking the weather, you go to Walmart to see if the Strawberry Pop-Tarts are there, because it's such a reliable system. Like, I know that they're watching the weather, but I mean, there's some crazy innovation here. Both the satellite link, and then Walmart, supposedly, was the owner of the first commercial 1-terabyte enterprise data warehouse they built with a company called Teradata. They were just maniacal about making sure all the sales and customer data flowed into one place. By 2001, just nine years later, that one-terabyte warehouse had grown to 70 terabytes. Anay Shah (00:49:14): Wow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:49:15): Right. So this was just an explosion of connectivity inside the enterprise, even while there was the personal computer. Some people had fun with their computers at home. I remember playing on an IBM XT as a kid, and some early programming and early games. It was not like most people had a real personal use case. We're still talking about a corporate-centered world. So we talked about the rise of PCs and the growing client-server LAN inside a company. We talked about these data centers; we talked about Walmart's satellite network. But what was happening now, going into the early 90s, with this whole ARPANET/NSFNET Internet thing? What was happening outside the office? Anay Shah (00:49:55): Yeah, and perhaps what was happening under the ground. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:49:58): So the first network that was available to all these researchers was the evolution of this into the NSFNET. It became the de facto US internet backbone. Anay Shah (00:50:07): This network was connecting 2,000 computers in 1986 and expanded to over 2 million by 1993. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:50:15): It was no longer just researchers who wanted to do stuff with it. So, the design and topology was a high-speed national backbone that had, at this point, gone to a T3 line (at 45 Mbps) that connected a small number of regional networks. So, kind of like a central hub-and-spoke model. These regional networks would then connect to universities, labs, and nonprofits. But this was not designed for commercial scale. Anay Shah (00:50:39): In fact, it was prohibited, according to their terms of use, to have commercial traffic running on that backbone. It was specifically designed for research, education, and government data. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:50:50): So, I think some private commercial network could happen inside just a regional hub, but not across that whole big backbone. So you did not have the beginnings of what could be a commercial internet. If two regional networks – say, New York and Philadelphia – wanted to connect, they had to flow back up to that NSFNET backbone. There was no neutral point where they could connect and exchange. So this was the moment when commercial ISPs and telcos started to see, "Okay, this internet thing is interesting, this packet-switched model." People wanted to do new things with this. Maybe it was trying to get out of the lab into commercial use. How were we going to connect? What were we going to do? Anay Shah (00:51:29): In 1992, a group of network providers were sitting in Virginia, drinking a beer, and decided to connect their networks outside of Tysons Corner. This specific group of engineers was from Metropolitan Fiber Systems, the local telco. They chose Tysons Corner outside of Washington D.C. because there was a dense network of defense contractors and early providers, which were heavy users of the current internet. They famously set up in a repurposed parking garage to become the de facto on-ramp for new ISPs. When you think about an important hub, you wouldn't typically think of a parking garage, but it was the right place at the right time. It turned into what was called Metropolitan Area Exchange East – East Coast. So MAE-East is what formed. And if you connected into MAE-East, that meant you had the internet at your doorstep. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:52:27): This became the hub for the internet. If someone sent an email from London to Paris, it most likely went through MAE-East. Anay Shah (00:52:35): Within a couple of years, roughly half the world's internet packets were flowing across the MAE-East parking garage. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:52:43): And I think this is something we'll see again and again, which is that the Internet forms around hubs. It's not always obvious why that became the hub specifically, other than it did first. And there's just this gravitational pull of connectivity. This wasn't new to the Internet; this was something that we saw with telcos. There's this concept called carrier hotels. You're in a city like New York, and you had two different carriers that were trying to connect with each other, right? Think Sprint and AT&T. Instead of having to connect all throughout the city in multiple spots, they would all show up in a neutral zone called a carrier hotel and build their connectivity infrastructure there. Anay Shah (00:53:21): You'd be able to tap into each other's long-haul routes, their local fiber routes, without having to build their own intercity footprints individually. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:53:31): And so May east was the first sort of flavor of this, where they would all come in and connect. Ultimately, a device — think a switch — that is connecting. Okay, you're coming in, plugging in your ISP traffic; here I'm plugging in mine. Now users across our ISPs can connect, and it's just one big switch room. The problem is, the Internet is scaling, and you don't necessarily want to all be bottlenecked on one switch. It's not the most secure thing. And if you're, I don't know, eventually building a video streaming service or you make a deal between two ISPs, you don't necessarily want everyone else to be in on that deal. And so you saw the evolution of this model to a different model that became known as MeetMe rooms. These are neutral physical rooms where an ISP or someone trying to hook into an ISP can provide their boxes and their connectivity, and then those two can connect directly. Anay Shah (00:54:20): So, a bring-your-own-box method. Instead of everyone connecting through the existing box, you BYO your box for the deal you want to do in the private MeetMe room. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:54:30): That's right. Something sounds funny about BYO to the private MeetMe room, but we're talking about ISPs connecting for data. Anay Shah (00:54:38): The farthest thing from a non-platonic conversation as you could be. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:54:44): And so, sure enough, this all worked. The NSF kind of officially sanctioned this method and designated these NAP points — Network Access Points. The first one, May east. They designated Sprint to run a NAP in New Jersey near the transatlantic cable landing points, one in Chicago, and one in San Francisco. Then they eventually added Mae west in San Jose. Anay Shah (00:55:06): And these MeetMe room models started to take off. The carrier hotels, you had One Wilshire, a large building on the west side of Los Angeles, which were law offices, and gave way to a single floor that could host hundreds of carrier routers and thousands of cross-connects, eventually making it one of the most valuable space per square foot on the entire West Coast. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:55:29): It's so funny. It's like this ugly building or just relatively nondescript architecture, and you're like, "What's going on in there?" Law offices make sense. And now this is where the West Coast Internet is coming through. Anay Shah (00:55:40): That's right. And we'll talk a little bit later about undersea cables, but they come in and want to find their shortest path to One Wilshire. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:55:48): And the business model was pretty genius for this. These telco hotels, these MeetMe rooms, ultimately provided power, cooling, and cross-connect, and they would charge rent. The dot-com boom to come would boost this model to new heights. Anay Shah (00:56:03): And it provided an elastic infrastructure that Internet companies in the dot-com boom and after could leverage, including, as we'll see soon, hyperscalers, where you could flexibly increase and decrease your capacity because they were specialized in providing all the necessary infrastructure to host the connectivity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:56:25): So all of this infrastructure being set up to commercialize the Internet, to provide a scalable backbone, to enable the private market of ISPs and telcos and others to invest in making the Internet faster. And we now have the World Wide Web. The NSF has actually funded a little project called Mosaic, which is the first user-friendly web browser. We have personal computing. Enter the mid-90s and the dot-com boom. Anay Shah (00:56:53): Let's boom! Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:56:54): The ISPs are ready to build the network. All we need are the users. Anay Shah (00:57:00): And boy, are they coming! In May of 1995, Bill Gates writes the famous Internet tidal wave memo: "The Internet is the single most important development to come along since the IBM PC." And it was that same year that Netscape went public. Why was Netscape so significant, Ben? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:57:21): I think it's significant for two reasons. One is it kicked off the accessibility of the Internet. It turned the Internet from this network for researchers to share files to this browser that you could download, install, and access the web, opening all of that up. And then it was that from a product perspective. But that also captured the economic perspective and interest: "Is there a thing here? Is there a new industry, a boom that you can make your millions or billions off of?" Its journey from founding to IPO in such a short cycle kicked off a mania. Anay Shah (00:57:56): It kicked off another mania in the business world, which was: having barely any revenue or profits, you could hit a multi-billion dollar valuation, which is what they did. And the web exploded. You had 23,000 websites in 1995 to over 10 million by the year 2000. Global users climbed to over 350 million. Nasdaq tripled in two years. If you put a dot-com at the end of your name, just kind of like you put 'AI' at the end of your name today, you could raise millions on an idea and a slide deck. And in 1999 alone, you had more than 400 Internet companies going public, pulling in $40 billion. What a liquid IPO market that we could only dream of! Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:58:40): Today Microsoft hits all-time highs in the stock market. The energy was manic, right? Founders in their 20s would become paper millionaires overnight. Engineers were hopping jobs for stock options. This is the rise of the Aeron chair, the foosball tables, and the new economy where the rules of things like revenue no longer apply to business. Anay Shah (00:58:59): But it wasn't just applications; it was infrastructure as well. Carriers spent half a trillion dollars on fiber and wireless. You had these colocation companies expanding at breakneck speed. This company called Exodus Communications was the world's largest web hosting provider at the time, providing server colocation. Its revenue went from 12 million in 1997 to 250 million two years later. It peaked at a $32 billion market cap three years after that. It was laying the infrastructure in the ground and building the applications above it in a period of unprecedented growth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:59:37): And so to launch a startup, you had to build a site, a service, and a database. You needed money way ahead of time to buy the servers to stick in the colo box. Anay Shah (00:59:48): Wait, so you're saying, in order for me to launch a web business, I had to buy hardware? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:59:53): Exactly. You had to take most of your venture capital dollars and spend it on servers even before you knew if anyone wanted to go to your website to begin with. Anay Shah (01:00:02): So you couldn't test your idea out, you couldn't A/B test, you couldn't do a landing page that drew in a... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:07): waitlist, couldn't do any of that. Anay Shah (01:00:09): Wow, what a different world! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:11): So all these new servers are trying to run on the new backbones that are being laid to power this boom. The traffic still at this point met at only a handful of public exchange points. Networks are plugged into these shared boxes at places like May east that we just talked about. That can only scale for so long. Anay Shah (01:00:30): You'd start to hit choke points, and May east, one of the earliest network access points, became one of those major choke points. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:38): We needed different models for companies, ISPs, non-ISPs, to connect. You had DEC kicking off Palo Alto with the Palo Alto Internet Exchange, a non-telco neutral spot. Then you had the founding of Equinix where they took that model and scaled it with their first site in Ashburn, Virginia. Anay Shah (01:00:59): Ashburn is the Wall Street for data centers. In 1999, Equinix launches their first data center under this new model in Ashburn, Virginia, right next to May east, the choke point. But the original network access point isn't. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:01:13): This, near D.C.? I've never been there. Have you been to Loudoun? Anay Shah (01:01:16): I grew up right outside of D.C. on the other side of the river. Loudoun county is on the Virginia side. It's rural farmland. It's past Dulles Airport. There's really nothing there. But it's proximal to a large East Coast population, the undersea cables and May East. And you actually had AOL choose Loudoun county in the mid-90s to set up a huge dial-up campus. So they laid fresh fiber and drew even more carriers into the region. And May east had grown so large it outgrew the parking garage it was in. So the Exchange relocated to Ashburn. So you've got this unassuming farmland outside of Dulles Airport. And it was really catalyzed by a couple things. Outside of AOL pioneering the new site, it was policy-led. So Loudoun county ruled that data centers could be treated like ordinary office parks. They eliminated all these special use hearings and provided incredible tax breaks over time to attract data centers into this network. Coupled with that, Dominion Energy, seeing what was coming ahead, offered some of the lowest industrial rates to string high-voltage lines to this empty land to bring power and fiber together to create the new data center model which Equinix pioneered in Ashburn and became the largest Internet hub on planet Earth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:02:42): So it's the combination of perhaps for a moment, cheap land (not so much anymore), fiber and connectivity, cheap and accessible power, and favorable policy. One interesting policy story that I heard on this: Apple was looking for where to put a new site in the late 2000s, 2009. Apple's obviously building more services, needing more storage, and building more data centers. So they run a process, and it turns out that North Carolina gives them a better deal. So Virginia fights back and in reaction passes major tax breaks to say that if you're building a data center, basically if you're building anything more than $150 million of investment, you're going to employ more than 50 people — no tax. Anay Shah (01:03:22): You, of course, are. If you're building a data center, of course. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:03:24): Of course. Yeah, you can't build a data center for $150 million. Anay Shah (01:03:27): Local policy, as you mentioned, is so important. Federal policy actually played a big role here. In 1996, we passed the Telecommunications Act. And one of the main things it did was force the incumbent telcos — which were regional monopolies from the AT&T breakup — to lease their physical network (their copper pairs, their fiber) to their competitors. So prior to this, a data center was a private enterprise tied to a single carrier because the carriers only used their own fiber. Now it enabled carrier-neutral sites. So you could become a tenant of a data center and choose from multiple fibers provided into that building. And it opened up an explosion of choice for tenants and for this carrier-neutral model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:04:11): And so this is a flywheel of a deregulation environment to build this because once they have the tax incentives in, it becomes a major source of economic prosperity for the region. Now, we'll fast forward later on in the story to today, and maybe hitting some of the first real pushback. Anay Shah (01:04:27): And similar to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, Tokyo, the biggest hubs are where you can find cables and carriers and connect the most networks with the least amount of friction possible. And it's this flywheel that continues to make Ashburn the largest home of data centers in the U.S. And what a time! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:04:47): In the first six months of 1995, Internet traffic was doubling every 100 days. The telcos were convinced that you couldn't overbuild. You just needed all the fiber you could put down. Anay Shah (01:04:56): WorldCom and these other telcos, they just poured billions into this. And the idea of overbuilding — not possible, particularly in this Internet boom, right? But by 2000, how much of that installed fiber was actually being used? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:05:11): It was only about 3% — 3% was lit up. So they just laid down fiber, the shards of glass that were just sitting there empty. Anay Shah (01:05:19): So to give you a sense of the amount of fiber miles laid during this period, you could go around the circumference of the Earth 5,000 times. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:05:27): Wow. So this was all over land, right? But how would you connect to Europe? Anay Shah (01:05:31): Ah, and that overbuild, you're right, was not just limited to land. Nearly all intercontinental Internet traffic rides on undersea cables, which I'd kind of heard of, but I didn't really have a full appreciation for the fact that bundles of glass threads are wound into a garden hose structure and laid down on the ocean floor all over the world. So imagine a planet stitched together with hair-thin strands of glass tucked into an armored hose and laid across the darkest parts of the ocean. That's the undersea cable system, and it's the real physical Internet that connects the continents. So 99% of international data still rides on these cables, not satellites. That's racing pulses of light through fibers thinner than the human hair. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:23): The story arguably starts way back in the 1850s, when we had the first telegraph cables crossing the Atlantic. They brought those across steamships and landed the first link in 1866, able to send news for the first time across the ocean. Anay Shah (01:06:38): So instead of weeks, you could get the news in minutes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:41): Yeah, you're not sending the news via ship, you're sending it via electrons. Anay Shah (01:06:44): Amazing! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:45): Fast forward to 1988, and we land the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable. It runs between the U.S., the U.K., and France, and it kicks off this new era of cross-continental capacity. By the late 90s, as this boom was happening, you can imagine the funding routes going into wiring all of this up. Anay Shah (01:07:07): You lay all this cable down with specialized cable ships that survey the seabed, unspool the cable, and then near shore they bury it underneath to protect it from anchors and storms, and then raise it up through some nondescript concrete box. This garden hose has optical repeaters that boost the light every 50-100 km, so you can sprint thousands of miles without fading. Then you get to land, and these concrete bunkers have the cable hop up into terrestrial fiber and then run straight to your One Wilshire or any of your nearby hubs that then connect you onward. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:07:44): What a wild thing. You have a garden hose-shaped thing moving all this data. What do we actually mean? Well, modern cable, as an example, one laid in 2018, can move 250 terabits per second. To conceptualize that, you can send 6,000 HD movies in one second, or about 20% of global internet traffic can go in one garden hose. How is this working? Well, at the beginning of using fiber optics, you would shine a laser down and blink your zeros and ones. But we've moved from doing that with one wavelength to doing what's called wavelength division multiplexing. That's a fancy way of saying we use the rainbow; we're using multiple. Usually, it's around 80 to 120 different colors that can go down the same cable at the same time. The other thing is we've added more fibers. So instead of there being a pair of fibers, we now have up to 12 to 16 pairs of fibers. And then the last thing is called coherent optics. This is a way of modulating the amplitude of the light. So instead of it just being on and off, you can actually have multiple steps. All of this adds up to today, probably 250-300 terabits maximum capacity in one hose. There are hundreds of hoses around the world. And I think the other thing that's really cool about this is the thing that was laid was the glass. We keep increasing the capacity of the glass because the glass is the glass—resilient infrastructure. It's kind of like railroads. It's like we're still using the tracks. Anay Shah (01:09:07): From long ago, even if the engine gets upgraded. And just like we've been talking about with this network effect, when you bring more networks in, it increases the value and the speed. And so that's a big reason why Ashburn, as we talked about, hardened. Once hundreds of carriers and thousands of cross-connects land into a single place, moving it is impossible. And so if you need to reach Europe fast from the East Coast, you're going to colocate where the undersea cable is already coming. You've got New York, New Jersey, Virginia, tying to Cornwall, England, and to Marseille. You've got the Red Sea and the Mediterranean corridor connecting into Djibouti as a critical touch point. You've got Miami as a key touch point into Latin America. Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan are key corridors into Asia Pacific. Mombasa and Lagos now light up Africa's East Coast. Hundreds of cables have converged that have connected the entire world. And this then forms the network of data centers that we have built and will continue to build through this story. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:10:16): And so the boom continues, right? Anay Shah (01:10:19): No, there was something like the bust to that boom. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:10:23): That's right. And by 2001, everything collapsed. Advertising folded, startups folded. Exodus, that we talked about earlier, filed for bankruptcy, had nearly $6 billion in debt. PSINet, one of the largest ISPs, had already collapsed. So, was this the death of the internet and the death of the value of all of this fiber that was laid? Clearly not. It was the death of a particular moment and an overbuild and a bubble. But in fact, the actual infrastructure that was built out would prove immensely valuable as services that mattered matured and business models matured. In other words, I'd say the application layer of this era died, but the infrastructure lived on and would eventually thrive. Anay Shah (01:11:03): So the dot-com tide went out. But the overbuilt assets were exactly what we needed for the next chapter. And it included infrastructure that we can't live without. The carrier hotels, the fiber, the data centers, the glass in the ocean didn't disappear. It just changed owners, and there was a fire sale, right? Assets were being sold at a fraction of the cost. A few key actors survived, and a few new ones stepped in. Equinix survived the crash. They doubled down on the real asset that they had, which was interconnection. That neutral meet-me room turned into a marketplace where competitors paid you to be neighbors because the value was in the speed, the reliability, and the flexibility that these carrier hotels provided. Meanwhile, private equity swoops in, as they will in every bust cycle, and reframes the category. So, one in particular buys a couple dozen distressed facilities around the world, turns it into a vehicle called Digital Realty Trust, takes it public as the first pure-play data center REIT, and treats compute space like real estate. These weren't high-tech moonshot assets they were buying. They're bringing patient capital in to standardize the shell, finance it cheaply, and get long leases, which becomes a blueprint for the next two decades of data center buildouts. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:12:30): In addition to the sobering economic environment of 2001 from the bust, there was also September 11. These financial institutions were still operating in this moment, having their key servers trading information connectivity with banks in their offices or right near their offices. So when 9/11 happened, the Verizon 140 West Street Central Office, one of the largest telecom hubs in the city, was blasted with debris, and dust flooded the equipment rooms. Tens of thousands of voice and data circuits were knocked offline immediately. Most of those circuits were powering exactly that: brokerages, market data providers, the trading floors, low-latency connectivity to the stock exchange and clearinghouses. So imagine the market is just disconnected now in a flash. And this cascaded. Engineers worked night and day to bring things back online. I was looking into Morgan Stanley's experience. They saw their whole trading system go down. They had a disaster recovery site in New Jersey, but they didn't have the same level of connectivity and data feeds. So it took them a few days. They ran new fiber through building basements, patched hubs into another telco hub that was still operating to restore capacity so they could trade when the stock exchange opened on September 17th. And I think coming out of this, there was a whole reshaping of the data center world to think about resiliency in a new way. I think it showed the physicality in the city of this connectivity right in this moment, where you could take for granted that you could take action on data over there, whether a trade or market data. Anay Shah (01:14:07): And it wasn't enough to have redundancy on another floor in the same neighborhood. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:14:12): Right. Anay Shah (01:14:12): We had to start thinking about an infrastructure build-out in different locations with different networks, facilities, and routes to really build true resilience and switch over to the point where now, if a data center goes down, there's automatic rerouting, and we don't see those same blips, although it happens from time to time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:14:31): This early 2000s phase is a real maturing and growing up of the entire industry to realize that these servers and data centers are holding important financial data and need to be treated as such. But meanwhile, in consumer land, there's a glimmer of light, and it's a big one. This is the era that we move from that squeaky, squealy phone modem to broadband. Anay Shah (01:14:55): I remember touring for colleges, and some had Ethernet across the campus, and others didn't. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:01): I feel like getting broadband to our house was a radically different experience. It was like a different internet. Anay Shah (01:15:08): The image didn't load from top to bottom. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:10): Bottom, it would just fly through. And so this is when BitTorrent starts soaring. This is when Skype launches in 2003, and you can actually make VoIP calls. Anay Shah (01:15:18): Oh, Napster was possible. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:20): World of Warcraft launches in 2004. I remember that, taking the college campus by storm. Early web video products started to come out. Anay Shah (01:15:28): By 2005, you had a billion people online, about 16% of the planet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:35): So all those folks prognosticating with excitement in the late '90s were not wrong. They were just off by five or six years. And so there's also the advent of CDNs. So Akamai's footprint exploded to provide more and more storage and replication and caching at the edge. Anay Shah (01:15:52): And so what exactly does this mean? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:55): It means at the places where your ISP is connecting, if someone's downloading an image—let's say you load the New York Times on your computer, and someone else does on their computer down the street—you don't both need to go all the way back to the New York Times home server for access to that photo. It's now been cached on a nearby CDN that's directly hooked up to your ISP. Anay Shah (01:16:13): So in the early to mid-2000s, you have the consumer coming back. Applications are flourishing. The internet is becoming a part of the fabric of society. And there are a handful of companies that survived the bust and captured this moment unlike any other. They not only built incredibly large consumer and enterprise businesses, but they actually became critical infrastructure companies that helped build the modern data center world. That is what we're seeing booming today. The place we're going to start with is the best place to buy books: Amazon.com. So whatever book you wanted to... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:16:50): Find, from A to Z. In July 1995, Amazon launches. By '97, they IPO, and by '98, they are no longer just a bookstore. They're on their path to becoming the Everything Store. Now, it was not initially Bezos's and Amazon's intention to become the infrastructure provider of the world. But this high-growth moment of the late '90s set the stage for what they would need to build, not just for themselves, but for everybody. In those early days, they were running expensive, quote, unquote, reliable servers from the likes of DEC. Extremely expensive products—high-margin servers. Now, the problem is Amazon was not a high-margin business. They're trying to go for scale. They're selling things at whatever the cost was to pass through. They are a retailer trying to be the lowest-margin retailer out there. The cheapest way to get your book delivered to your doorstep. Anay Shah (01:17:45): So, running a retail business, they're always... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:17:48): Tight on cash, so spending it on servers stopped making sense. So by 2000, they were spending so much on infrastructure they were worried this was going to bankrupt them. And so they kicked off a big project to rewrite all of Amazon.com onto Linux and to run it on much cheaper HP servers. Anay Shah (01:18:05): And this is when Amazon was famously a huge monolithic codebase. Every new category they launched, they had to work across their entire codebase. And it became this hairball. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:18:17): By, I think, around 2002, Bezos had had enough of that, and he issued the famous API mandate that internally every team had to expose functionality through hardened, documented service interfaces designed not just to be used by internal teams, but eventually potentially externalizable. Anay Shah (01:18:33): Classic Bezos. There are no exceptions. Every team must communicate through these interfaces. There were no backdoors, no direct threads, no direct linking. It didn't matter what that technology did. It would, without exception, be designed from the ground up to communicate externally to other teams. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:18:52): And if you didn't do this, what would happen? Anay Shah (01:18:54): If you didn't do this, you were canned. So, in this moment of reboot, it seems like the question that the company's leaders are asking themselves is: How are we able to scale our business like a software business and not like a furniture business? What if compute could scale with demand? And if we can do this for ourselves, why not rent it to the rest of the world? They were on the precipice of not just a technical breakthrough, but a business model breakthrough. Because for decades, running an online business meant these multi-year leases, these expensive servers, and over-provisioning to handle peak demand. And Amazon would go on to flip this on its head and fundamentally change internet businesses by saying you can rent a server by the hour and pay for only what you use. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:19:47): It is both deeply innovative at the time and also funny because we've had decades—a century—of doing this with our electricity bills in our own houses or water bills, right? This is utilities, utilities. You've always just paid for what you use. But what it continually enables is the driving down of cost and better utilization of centralized infrastructure. And Amazon had just lived through this painful period of having to rewrite their software and change their server architecture. And I think it was two things. One is: we never want to go through this again. A. B. No one should have to go through this again. And C, if we start to build the infrastructure for the world, that's going to accrue to our costs and our benefit. And there's going to be a flywheel here, just like any scale economies provider ever experiences. The bigger we get, the better. Anay Shah (01:20:39): That's right. And that utilization is such a key point. So, what happens in March of 2006? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:20:44): Amazon launches the first real AWS service: S3, or Simple Storage Service. Anay Shah (01:20:51): What does this Simple Storage Service do for me as a small internet business? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:20:56): It lets anyone put a blob of data on this non-physical disk and access it anywhere in the world. And that sounds simple in the name, but it was shockingly hard to put a blob—whether that was a megabyte, a gigabyte, or a terabyte of data—out there and have everyone around the world be able to access it quickly. Amazon abstracted everything away so that you could do that and just pay a monthly fee. You didn't have to build a server and plug in a hard disk and build another one that copied the data over and all these other things. It just gave you what you need as a developer. Anay Shah (01:21:32): So this enabled me to store information. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:35): Correct. Anay Shah (01:21:35): A few months later, what did they do? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:37): They launched the Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as EC2. Anay Shah (01:21:41): So I can store, and now you're telling me I can compute. How does this work? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:45): You can compute. And so what EC2 essentially was the ability to spin up computers—servers, as you saw fit. Now, what they were actually letting you spin up is what's called a virtual machine, where you can say, "I want to run Linux," or "I want to run Windows," or "I want to run some SQL Server OS," and I would have this virtual machine where I could deploy that, run it, and run whatever code I need to. And if I need a second machine, I push a button and get a second machine. If I need a third machine, a third machine. And I pay by the hour, by the machine, only for what I'm using. Anay Shah (01:22:16): This is outstanding. So I'm building a business, and I think I'm going to grow fast, but I don't know what traffic I'm going to get next month or in six months. And so I just raised a bunch of VC money. Now you're telling me I don't have to buy these expensive HP and Sun servers, and as I grow, I can just rent more compute and rent more space? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:22:37): Yeah, not just that, but I think the activation energy here was brought way down. Before there was the challenge of getting a server and getting space and all that. But in this model, now you just put down your corporate card, and you're off and running with the foundational building blocks that you need. Anay Shah (01:22:51): This is the Cambrian explosion for startups. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:22:53): Key to this is the utilization point. So many startups had bought servers that then never hit full utilization, or we talked about all these appliances sitting in the backroom closet not hitting full utilization. What enabled Amazon to drive utilization? It was the fact that, yes, they gave you a quote-unquote "server" to run your operating system on. They did not give you a server; in reality, they gave you a virtual machine. Not a machine, a virtual machine. Well, what is a virtual machine? A virtual machine is the flavor of the concept of a machine. And this goes back to a company, VMware, that was founded in 1998 by Diane Green and Mendel Rosenblum. Seid and I got to take operating systems in college from Mendel. And then Diane, as we get to later in the story, was running Google Cloud around the time I was leaving Google. So, legends in this field and in this industry. What VMware did is they made it possible to take a normal computer—whether it was a server or a PC, for that matter—and run virtual machines on that computer. And why that's typically hard is a computer is usually made to run one operating system at a time, and that operating system is managing applications and making sure that the computer doesn't crash. Well, if all of a sudden you have multiple machines running on a computer at a time and one does something that you can consider kind of unsafe—right?—that would stall out the machine or do something that they weren't supposed to do, that could break the whole model. But VMware's first product enabled an unchanged Windows and Linux to run side by side on the same x86 box. This accelerated to even more interesting use cases. So you can actually hot-swap VMs on machines at the same time. Let me give you a concrete example here. Let's say you're playing a game on a PC. It was as though all of a sudden, in the snap of a half-second, that game moved to another machine mid-frame. So this was actually designed to be able to hot-swap a virtual machine from one server to the next. Anay Shah (01:24:55): So it didn't matter that you didn't actually have your own server, because your virtual machine could float around as needed. So let's say that you have a hard drive crash. Well, you could have a snapshot running in the background and you could flip over to that one in real time. And so this notion of a virtual machine becomes the backbone for both the utilization point, because one physical server can be used to actually host multiple virtual machines, and a lot of the redundancy and fallback designs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:25:24): And VMware wasn't the only one to do this. Eventually there was the open-source Xen project. That is what Amazon and AWS first used. This kind of thread becomes better and better over time as all the hyperscalers have figured out how to maximally virtualize everything that they do. Anay Shah (01:25:38): And so now, rather than me trying to run my pets.com and ensure that my product is getting to my customer and my website is doing everything... And then when it crashes, me having to stop everything, file the ticket, and pause business to fix the crash—that's just abstracted out to the specialists, to a business that is designed to solve this problem for me. And all I get then is continuous production, continuous service. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:08): And it gets cheaper for you every year. Anay Shah (01:26:10): It gets cheaper. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:11): The cost of S3 and EC2 has just gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. It's an amazing business. And for many others, as we'll get into the story, building these data centers and the utility business is not their high-margin business. But for Amazon, this business has margins, which makes it a high-margin business compared to their retail business. Anay Shah (01:26:30): It's almost like if I were an airline spending all this time trying to figure out how to book a reservation, and then you gave me a program that could do it for me. I can now focus on serving the customer and serving more customers faster, and it explodes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:45): Right. If you look at S3 in 2007, there were 10 billion items stored in S3. By 2009, that was about 64 billion. And by last year, 400 trillion items were stored in S3. Anay Shah (01:26:58): That's a really big number. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:27:00): It's a very big number. It's a lot of items. This powers the startup ecosystem and industry. Let's go back in time. So, what was driving the growth of all these numbers? Anay Shah (01:27:11): We're in Hackathon City. We're having happy hours with engineers and folks with ideas coming together. Now, if you have an idea, you can drop a credit card down, and you don't need to negotiate and buy hardware. No invoices, no contract, no sales calls. You're up and running within hours. AWS very brilliantly saw this as a pathway for short-term and long-term growth. In the short term, they can get a bunch of early-stage startups using their compute, and that's not going to amount to a lot of money. But some of them are going to grow, and they're going to be built on AWS. So they actually had a business model of giving out free credits at these happy hours, at these hackathons, to make AWS the default infrastructure platform to build a new company. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:28:03): I think it feeds through from that go-to-market to their product design. Their product design was deeply unopinionated about what you were going to do. It was to make it easy for you to get a server to go do what you want to do with it. Here's storage, as simple as it can be. These are the simplest Lego blocks you can build on. And so simple, in fact, that people then built what feels like the same business on top of them. Ever heard of Dropbox? Dropbox is just an S3 application for this whole early period. Anay Shah (01:28:31): It's storage. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:28:32): It's storage. Let's make it easy for syncing files from your computer to this new cloud thing, backing them up, syncing them, and sharing them with other people. Dropbox and S3 are intimately linked, and Dropbox is built to do exactly that. It wasn't until 2015 that they were like, "Okay, we should probably look at the cost of this." They eventually moved off of AWS to their own servers because all they are is the storage layer. So that's a rare case where it made sense. Anay Shah (01:28:59): That's all they are. They're still getting $11.99 a month for me. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:29:01): That's right. Good lock-in. The Dropbox AWS story is a classic one, but there's probably no better partnership to exemplify this time than the one that Netflix had with AWS. Anay Shah (01:29:14): Their ability to scale with these companies is really something to behold. In 2008, Netflix was still primarily a DVD-by-mail company. For those of us that remember, it had launched a streaming service as a side feature. The leadership knew that there was something here. But in August of 2008, Netflix suffered a major database corruption in its primary data center. For three days, it disrupted their DVD shipping and their streaming ability. It stopped their business. This was a huge wake-up call. The recovery was very painful for Netflix. They realized that their on-prem, vertically scaled systems were too fragile, and they couldn't recover quickly enough from major failures. The leadership decided they needed architecture that was designed to be more fault-tolerant, elastic, and globally available, because they had aspirations of being able to stream their future business all over the world. They concluded that they needed to focus on their core business. Building this out in-house was slow and costly. So Netflix actually became AWS's first marquee, all-in, public reference of a customer that scales. This proved to be vital. By 2015, Netflix was delivering billions of hours of content annually, almost entirely over AWS and their own CDN. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:30:33): They were running thousands of EC2 instances and had all of their videos, the canonical system of record, in S3 — like the actual videos that we are watching now. They did at some point realize that it was so important for them to own the latency and cost of that last mile of delivery—that edge. This is a perfect example of a use case for CDNs. They launched in 2012 what they call OpenConnect and the Open Connect appliances. This means that they would go into those "meet-me rooms" that we had talked about before and drop a Netflix peering box that would directly connect to your local ISP, and they would do this for free. Right? The ISP just says, "Hey, we have a lot of people trying to access Netflix. Let's make it better, faster, and cheaper." Anay Shah (01:31:17): It's a win-win. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:31:18): It's a win-win. They cut out the CDN that they were using at the time. Netflix saves money. Customers are happier. Everyone gets their videos faster. This way, when someone on the ISP accesses the newest popular movie, it's already close to them. Amazon doesn't actually even — they barely get hit in that moment. It's obviously running what's called the control plane for Netflix. Anay Shah (01:31:38): Yeah, because if I have to wait three or four seconds for that preview to load, I might not watch that show. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:31:43): You might churn. This is what powers streaming to this day. The same model is what enables others to enable streaming at scale. All of this — this whole Netflix case study — is the perfect flywheel and customer to show that AWS can scale with you, scale in a really challenging environment, be resilient, and power global reach. Netflix was not just a U.S. company at this point. Anay Shah (01:32:05): Yeah. For anyone that saw AWS and the cloud as a concept — as risky, unable to scale, or not enterprise-ready — Netflix helped debunk that for chief information officers around the world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:32:22): They would just do whatever it took. I can't remember the exact story — I think this is from the Acquired episode — where Amazon would allow you to ask them to roll in a big truck, slurp up all your data into hard drives, then they'd bring it to their data center to plug in and dump all your data into your AWS instance. So, they figured out what was needed to close the enterprise customers. It's just amazing that someone known for selling books was able to so quickly build the brand around how to do this new, private, secure utility thing at scale. Anay Shah (01:32:54): So AWS continued to rethink what data centers are used for and how to build them out to serve the customer. Rather than having one mega-facility per market, they introduced the concept of Availability Zones, which became clusters of independent data centers within a region — each on separate power lines, each on separate fiber paths, linked with millisecond private connections. This Availability Zone concept and clustering was yet another piece of the data center evolution that AWS contributed to the ecosystem. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:33:29): I feel like this notion of U.S. East and U.S. West — this is how people think about their servers now — is this abstracted notion of an Availability Zone. Anay Shah (01:33:39): AWS continued to do this globally, and this actually became a blueprint for hyperscale. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:33:44): To end the Amazon story here for now, I think it would not be wrong to credit them with really kicking off the utility-scale cloud story, right? And getting so many things right: giving developers the simple building blocks they could use; going after cost, reliability, and redundancy; making sure to build the right guardrails for virtualization so that they could actually do this efficiently and build for the long term, using the same APIs internally so that it created a flywheel for them to move faster and bring those cost benefits back to the core business. It propelled them so far ahead in this business; they are still the leader to this day in the core cloud infrastructure product. Anay Shah (01:34:28): As a result, as we've been talking about, the data center is simple at its core, right? It's a facility with storage, compute, and connectivity. What AWS does is take the data center and enable it to build an economy on top of it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:34:46): To frame it another way, it used to be that if you wanted lights in your house — if you wanted electricity in your house to power those lights — you would put a dynamo to burn coal underneath your house, right? And if you wanted a website on the internet, you would buy a server and plug it into your home ISP. That is insane to us today. "What do you mean? You're going to power my house with electricity from underneath my house, right?" Instead, I'm going to hook up this shared infrastructure with all of my neighbors, and we're going to centralize our demand and build the cheapest, biggest infrastructure we can to generate the power. That's the same thing happening here for the first time. This is the introduction of the concept of the cloud, right? People have had the internet where they're interacting with publicly visible websites. Private enterprises have servers, but the idea that you have your own storage over there in a Dropbox folder, or you as a developer could build whatever you wanted and access this floating blob of data — that's to you — invisible where specifically it is, but it's out there. That was, I think, the conceptual notion of the cloud. I've come to somewhat dislike the phrase because it feeds into the invisibility of the infrastructure, right? It says, "It is nowhere. Your photos are nowhere, your storage is nowhere." Anay Shah (01:36:07): That's so far from the truth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:09): It is somewhere. Anay Shah (01:36:10): It is in multiple locations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:12): In fact, the cloud is almost the design antithesis of the glass room. The glass room where you want to show off, "This is where it is. This is where the compute is happening." Anay Shah (01:36:22): It is only happening here; it is happening right now. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:25): But it served a good purpose in explaining this notion of migrating to this unknown location, and has remained pretty sticky, I think. So, while Amazon was out there selling books, a little startup out of Stanford was helping you organize and access the information on the growing World Wide Web. Anay Shah (01:36:44): Google was founded in 1998, and shortly after, it was handling about 10,000 search queries per day. By the end of 2006, it was processing the same number of searches every second. Google acquired YouTube in 2006, a year after its founding, and at the time, it was already one of the fastest-growing websites in the world with 100 million video views per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:07): I remember folks having their first webmail-based accounts, like a Hotmail account. They'd have 2 to 4 megabytes. Well, Google notoriously on April 1, 2004, announced and launched Gmail as an invite-only service that had a full gigabyte of storage. Anay Shah (01:37:22): I remember you could get access if you referred in. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:25): If you referred in, or they started going on eBay for like $150, it was a hot ticket. By 2010, Gmail had over 150 million users. And of course, with more gigabytes of. Anay Shah (01:37:36): Storage available, it was amazing. It was from the very beginning the front door to the internet. But it was also going to need to be an infrastructure company. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:46): So, you go back to 1999, a year into Google's life, and an engineer named Urs is being shown around as part of his recruitment by Larry Page, the CEO and founder. Urs says you couldn't really set foot in the first Google cage because it was so tiny. The cage was 7ft by 4ft with 30 PCs arranged on the shelves, providing the world with more Google than it could handle. Our direct neighbor was eBay. A bit further away was a giant cage housing Deck machines and AltaVista. All of this was hosted at Exodus in Santa Clara, one of those colo locations that we talked about earlier. Anay Shah (01:38:21): So, Google was competing with AltaVista and all those others at the time. It was powering part of Stanford Search. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:38:28): That's right. Anay Shah (01:38:29): And running off of 30 PCs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:38:32): Running off of 30 PCs in this colo center, it cost Google about $1,400 per month per Mbps of data. So they had to purchase 2 Mbps. At the time, 1 Mbps was about a million queries per day. From the beginning, Google looked at its servers and infrastructure differently. It was never interested in taking the tried-and-true path of buying the Sun or even HP boxes. Anay Shah (01:38:56): One of the most memorable stories of this time that explains this is the infamous corkboard. So, in the early days, Google engineers literally mounted motherboards on corkboard. They had $15 box fans pushing air across. They had zip ties holding it together. In a traditional IT philosophy, this is heresy. But the idea was that if a part doesn't add reliability at fleet scale, strip it away. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:39:24): This all set in motion an ethos of questioning the assumptions and, ultimately, deep, deep vertical integration of their infrastructure. Some might argue that that was Google's superpower, and still remains so to this day. Apple's piling all of that thinking into making the perfect iPhone; Google's doing it to their data centers. Anay Shah (01:39:43): So Google had a number of innovations that came from this early time. One was around how to do power backup. So, the standard was to spend for a facility-wide big battery. Well, by 2000, Google was questioning this model and seeing the waste in the large battery. So they actually put little batteries on each server. Again, they were accepting that one might go down, but that was okay as long as the whole fleet was reliable. The key to all of this working was moving reliability up the stack into the software layer. Google was not using off-the-shelf file systems and off-the-shelf software. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:40:22): They built everything here themselves. They assumed that hard drives would break, so they built the Google File System. This was around 2001-2002. So, this is a distributed file system that would take files, chunk them up, and spread them across three different servers no matter what. So you could always have resiliency. Also, this would make accessing a search index much faster. In 2003, they built Borg, a cluster manager, which ultimately was all about managing where jobs were running on which servers and machines. And it really was an extension of the virtualization and predates Kubernetes, which we'll talk about a little bit later. So, these were all the software components, but they were also questioning many of the physical constraints that people had looked at with servers. Most notably, they did some of the first experiments in "hot aisle, cold aisle" airflow containment. Traditionally, data centers were just a bunch of hot computers in a room, and they would blast cold air into the room. So you'd have to keep the room as cold as possible, often uncomfortably cold. There was no real thought about getting the hot air out of the room. Over time, it became accepted wisdom that you should point servers in one direction, get the hot air out of the room, and encourage that to happen. Google realized that the more you took that to an extreme, the better. So they would heat up and isolate the hot aisle from the cold aisle because then you could actually extract the hot air more efficiently and not mix it back into the cold. So, what we mean by cold aisle and hot aisle is that cold air needs to blow across those exposed chips and motherboards that would extract the heat off of the server into the hot aisle, and then the hot air from the hot aisle would need to be extracted out of the room. Google became a leader in designing the best airflow there. Anay Shah (01:42:05): This is a concept that continued for years. You also think about the traditional data center and this idea of assuming something's going to fail and building around that. Whereas in a colo facility, or when you're renting out these cages, every server had to work because it was a different company utilizing it. Not only that, 20 years ago you had specialty cleaning crews that were moving around the data center, and they would sweep up the room and then analyze the contaminants they had just swept up to understand how to continue to optimize the cleanliness and space around it. The idea of laying in a corkboard and a zip tie around it, and assuming something would fail, really takes the data center concept that existed then and completely flips it on its head and, as we'll see, drives better performance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:42:59): All of this comes together when they build their own first scaled, homegrown data center. Anay Shah (01:43:05): I love this idea: Don't think of a data center the way we've been defining it, as a room packed with servers, power, and connectivity. Think of it as a warehouse-scale computer. Urs wanted us to think of it not as many machines, but as one machine. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:43:22): So, you think about the components of a computer, right? The storage, the memory, the compute. Urs saw what they were building out over time in their data centers and realized that they were just building a large computer that happened to be the shape of the warehouse. Anay Shah (01:43:38): Yeah. If you accept this premise, then you stop trying to make each server perfect, but you start thinking about making the fleet reliable, and you design entirely differently. So, this is about 2004. You have a wild man named Chris Sacca. So, before he was a famed investor, he was apparently a young, sloppily dressed individual walking around rural Oregon looking for "shovel-ready" enterprise zones where he could find some tax breaks. He was walking around asking for such astronomical quantities of power that, allegedly, a nearby town suspected him as a terrorist and called the Department of Homeland Security. But this was just what he was looking for. The Dalles, Oregon, had a site for him: 30 acres next to a decommissioned aluminum smelter that once drew enough power to power the needs of a small city. Sacca was ecstatic. He said it was visionary. This little town with no tax revenues had figured out that if you want to transform an economy from manufacturing to information, you've got to pull fiber. So Google went on to build out The Dalles, Oregon, and bring all of their innovation to bear to increase the performance of this data center. So, what that meant was low-cost, steady hydropower from the Columbia River; the Bonneville Corridor, providing high-voltage transmission; a cool, dry climate that lets you run a cooling process most of the year that's very economical; long-haul fiber that traces the river's edge; and a town that was hungry for a new tenant. This all came together to launch Google's first warehouse-scale computer to drive down unit economics, improve the performance of a data center, and therefore the unit economics of the entire fleet. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:45:35): And I would argue this is potentially the first built-from-the-ground-up, hyperscale data center. They're building to solve their problems, but their problems are at this point scaling so rapidly that they're thinking about how to optimize all these things, tuned with software, tuned with virtualization, and so this is the new blueprint for the future. That is still how we're generally designing data centers today. Anay Shah (01:46:01): They had a head start in thinking about infrastructure from the get-go, making it part of their DNA. It's not as if the other companies were standing still; they were building concurrently. This was a race, and they had to do it quietly. Google was the first to get operational in 2006. They quickly replicated this elsewhere in North Carolina and then in Finland, testing different climates to optimize. This included using seawater, hot aisle containment, and other ways to optimize cooling and performance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:46:32): Yeah, there were other areas they kept pushing on, like the power supply system. Normally, each server you think about plugging into the wall converts AC to DC and then steps down DC for all the various components. Google instead realized that if they could just have a higher voltage DC current coming into the rack, they could then convert once cleanly and do it as late as possible. With that higher voltage, you'd have less loss, and you'd get efficiency gains across the whole path. So, at the scale Google was building servers, they could optimize every single part of the stack. Anay Shah (01:47:07): They later announced this 48-volt DC in 2016, publicly revealing double-digit efficiency gains that the world could then incorporate into data center design. Now, we've talked quite a bit about performance and efficiency, and there's good reason for that. Many data center companies were hemorrhaging money on power. The impact on the bottom line was significant enough that it needed focus. We had the distinct pleasure of talking to one of the OGs in data centers, Christian Belady. He told us this fantastic story of bringing the metric for power efficiency to the industry. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:47:55): It's called PUE, or Power Usage Effectiveness. This is a simple ratio of the total energy consumed by a data center, divided by the actual IT equipment you're trying to power. Right? So, it very easily spits out the overhead in running your data center. If it's two, that means twice as much energy is used for overhead than for the actual servers. And how did this metric come to be? Such a simple, beautiful metric. Anay Shah (01:48:21): Christian Belady was working at HP in the late 90s, and HP had a customer in Japan called NTT Docomo. Christian had been in the industry for so long that he had formulated enough standards through HP and the industry to come up with 10 best practices. He took these 10 best practices to Docomo, and they said, "Yes, this is great, we're going to implement all of this!" He replied, "Fantastic, come back in three months and we'll do a review." So he goes back to Japan, and they had printed out everything, with big stacks of paper on the desk. Everyone was in a suit and tie in a hot room when they told him, "Mr. Belady, we've done everything you said. Here are all of our reports, and nothing's changed. The servers are all still the same." Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:49:07): "It's even hotter in the hot aisle, and no one wants to go back there. So it doesn't seem like it's any better." Anay Shah (01:49:12): "That's right. We're still hot when we go in there. We don't think this is working. We're going to go back to the way we were doing it." Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:49:18): And it drives Christian nuts. The whole point was that you actually want the hot aisle to be hotter and the cool aisle to be cooler. That separation is what drives the efficiency. You don't want the air to mix. He knew in his bones, "No, you're running in a more efficient way. You have to see that." Anay Shah (01:49:35): NTT couldn't see the change or measure the efficiency gains of the hot aisle/cool aisle containment or the other recommendations that Christian was making. So he invented this incredibly elegant metric and kept it internal to HP. They continued to implement it in HP for six years until his good friend Chris Malone suggested he publish a paper and present it at Ken Brill's Uptime Institute in 2006. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:50:02): At the Uptime Institute, they presented the paper and kicked off a new organization called The Green Grid to publish PUE and other metrics. The team included Christian Belady, Paul Perez, Bruce Shaw, and Larry Vertel. These folks later became CTOs of Dell and led big teams at AMD. They thought it was just going to be an internal "here's the thing we tried" kind of paper. It hit the industry like a storm because the PUE race was now on, and Google wanted to win. Many enterprises had PUE numbers around 2, meaning twice as much power went to lights, cooling, and everything else compared to the amount of power that actually ran the IT hardware. Google pushed it down to 1.1, meaning only 10% of the power was not directly used to power the computers. Anay Shah (01:50:50): Their internal teams took hold of this and ran with it. They used this rethinking of the data center from the ground up as one computer system, with software being the reliability layer, not the hardware. This, along with innovative geographic placement, drove performance and PUE. It's come to a point where it essentially can't be optimized past one. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:51:16): Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's talk about what it is to go to one of these data center campuses. Anay Shah (01:51:23): You're driving up into vast open space where you suddenly see massive buildings growing out of the ground. From the sky, it maybe looks like a distribution center. You can see some steam flowing out from the building. But as you drive into this campus... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:51:42): You start noticing: "Why would there be so much power infrastructure if this is just a warehouse?" Because you're seeing big battery packs, extra turbines, or generators. Anay Shah (01:51:52): The other thing you'll notice is that security is everywhere. You'll have to pass through a series of checkpoints as you get to the front desk. Maybe they're powering Netflix, but they're also powering Pentagon operations. They have an enterprise obligation, so security is paramount. So, once you're approved, you manage to get through multiple layers of gates. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:14): And then there's a moment—the moment of big reveal—when you walk in, and it finally hits you: the rows and rows and rows of machines that just go on further than... Anay Shah (01:52:24): The eye can see. These facilities are bigger than a football field, and they're lined with racks of blinking lights and machines. You're hearing this constant whir, and you're noticing the temperature. When you walk in, it might be fairly comfortable. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:42): I think 80 degrees is average in a Google data center today. What did it used to be like? Anay Shah (01:52:47): You had to keep these machines cool, and the best way to do that was to chill the room. So it was frigid; the entire room was blasting with AC. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:57): Back in the 80s, you'd just wear a thick sweater all the time. Now they can comfortably hover around 80. That's because of the really good containment they did of hot and cold aisles. Now you've taken in the machines, adjusted to the noise, and they've given you earplugs to get comfortable. You look up and start to see the infrastructure coming in, powering these servers and connecting them. Google famously had bright-colored wires and marked where the plumbing was. But it wasn't always like this. If you go back to the 80s, I think it was quite different. Anay Shah (01:53:27): You're now building right on the floor. But one of the ways to cool the data center decades ago was to raise the platform. So you'd actually look down and see that you're walking on panels above a hidden space where cold air was being pushed through. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:53:41): Per the trend of everything we've talked about, with Google driving the evolution, the question was: "What is the cheapest way to most efficiently do the thing we're doing?" And it stopped being those raised floors over time. Hopefully, that gives you a little taste of what it's like to walk into one of these. There is a nice Google podcast called 'Where the Internet Lives' that really gives a nice tour of exactly this. Anay Shah (01:54:00): It's a Google and Latitude Media production where you can actually hear the sounds as they record inside the data center. So the whir is very palpable. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:54:12): Google's investments continue to grow. They continue to vertically integrate, deeper and deeper. They go to their own sites, start buying up their own fiber. They took advantage of some of that dark fiber that we mentioned earlier, snapping a lot of it up. All of this is a capacity strategy. Ultimately, they want to have the capacity redundancy to drive their own cost down. While, mind you, they're building the highest-margin, best business in the world in the form of search and ads. So that whole flywheel allowed them to continue to invest in this infrastructure. Google had explosive demand, as they were the web company here. They had explosive internal use driving the value of the vertical integration. But the whole industry saw what was going on with AWS after its launch. And Google was one of many companies that realized they had some assets to put toward that, too. So they put together a team that launched App Engine in 2008. It let you run apps on Google's infrastructure, but was very opinionated about the app. It only supported Python with a particular framework. So it was quite different than Amazon's basic building block EC2 approach. It wasn't until 2013 that Google launched a general-purpose virtual machine capability. As a result of this approach, as well as Google's lack of enterprise sales and marketing motion, it took quite a while for their cloud program to get running. Things started to shift in 2014-2015. Google went public about its containerization strategy. If you recall our discussion of virtualization: you don't actually need to package up the whole operating system. You don't really care that it's running Windows or Linux. You actually generally just want to run the application. Containers are really a way to do that at the application level. This continued even further more recently with the idea of serverless functions. Anay Shah (01:55:59): So Google in 2014-2015 took the world by storm by open-sourcing Kubernetes and the Google Kubernetes Engine. It very quickly became the default way for programmers to use containers and migrate away from virtual machines. Now, they still didn't have an enterprise sales and partnerships muscle. But Ben, you were there at this time, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:56:18): That's right. That's when they brought in Diane Greene, who we previously talked about as the founder of VMware, to help build that muscle. By 2018, their cloud share was 7%, AWS was 34%, and Azure was 15%. So they were a distant third. Following through to 2019, a new leader came in who has been the leader since, and he has made big pushes, growing massively. Their cloud business is now a $13 billion business, growing 32% net-net. You look at Google's story, and it's interesting. They've always been technically ahead, especially internally. They've always had amazing dogfooders—meaning people inside using their infrastructure. The problem was they did not know how to sell to this customer. They were not really a developer platform, especially to the enterprise. This is a market Amazon had cracked, so they really had to learn new skills despite having the best tech in the entire ecosystem. The other story is that Google's vertical integration sometimes went too far. They figured out the best way to do this for themselves, but sometimes that led to blind spots in what someone not in the Google ecosystem might need. So, the idea that every developer was going to build a new Python framework that Google released was a little self-serving when it turned out engineers might just want maximum flexibility, which Amazon deeply understood. Anay Shah (01:57:33): And it all starts with giving the industry an entirely new way of thinking about it: Treat the data center as a single, evolving machine. Build the hardware to suit the software that will survive its own failures. Put the buildings in thermodynamically optimal and grid-optimal locations, and publish your math. Showcase your performance and your PUE so that everyone can have FOMO and try to play catch-up. So, Google was spending billions on land, buildings, and hardware, designing its own infrastructure and overturning the data center world by building software to bind it all. Which forced the entire industry to meet hyperscalers like Google on its own terms. Competition was heating up. It wasn't just Amazon and Google. There were even more household names quietly transforming themselves. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:58:28): By the mid-2000s, Microsoft was unquestionably the software king. Windows was powering 90% of desktops. Office was licensed to print money. But things were changing. Broadband penetration was climbing. We started to see the emergence of connected phones—BBM and BlackBerrys and things like that at the time. And internet-native companies. They saw Google and Amazon building, climbing, and proving that you didn't need to buy software on a CD to run interesting computing applications. Remember, the cloud, as we've been talking about, isn't just about backend developers. Applications themselves were starting to move—not just their backend, but the front end to the browser as well. Anay Shah (01:59:10): Right, on the browser. You remember, Salesforce was leading the charge here. They launched with this idea of "no software, all in the browser." By 2005, they were doing nearly $200... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:59:20): Million in revenue and capturing the mindshare, proving that this could be the future—not just of consumer applications, but also a business product like a CRM. Anay Shah (01:59:31): CRM enterprise B2B software. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:59:34): So you're there, sitting at Microsoft. That is your greatest fear: that you're not going to be part of the application and operating system of the future. That is your whole business. At this point, it's not like Microsoft didn't run any web services. Ten years prior, Gates had sent his memo of the "Internet Tidal Wave." They had invested; they bought and scaled Hotmail; they had MSN; they had Xbox Live. But these were all self-contained services. They hadn't yet thought about how to expose an infrastructure to others to build on. They loved building operating systems that would ultimately run on others' infrastructure. They had built one of the best businesses in history doing this. They would write this code once, print as many CDs as they could, and it was this amazing, high-margin business. They didn't have to go buy other people's hardware. Anay Shah (02:00:16): They'd print the CDs, they'd print the money. This idea of infrastructure as a service was radical. Inside Redmond, Washington, the pivot for Microsoft was framed as nothing less than existential. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:00:28): As is often the case in a company motion like this, it's about people and talent. So they bought a company, Groove Networks, that brought in the famous Ray Ozzie, who had previously led the development of Lotus Notes. They brought him into Microsoft and made him co-CTO of the company. This was so existentially important. Think about what Meta's doing today to staff up talent. It was *that* important at the time. The cloud was the existential thing. "We need the leader of the cloud, Ray Ozzie, to come in and lead the way through this charge." Anay Shah (02:00:58): "If we're going to bet everything we've built on this pivot, we're going to bring in the best talent." Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:01:03): So they bought the company, put them in charge, and this was a 5,000-word manifesto about what the future of Microsoft needed to be. It's worth reading the whole thing, and we'll link to it in the show notes. But Anay, would you read that key section that really stood out? Anay Shah (02:01:17): In Ray's memo, he says: "'Computing and communications technologies have dramatically and progressively improved to enable the viability of a services-based model. The ubiquity of broadband and wireless networking has changed the nature of how people interact, and they're increasingly drawn towards the simplicity of services and service-enabled software that just works.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:01:40): He ends that section by saying: "'Businesses are increasingly considering what services-based economics of scale might do to help them reduce infrastructure costs, or deploy solutions as needed and on a subscription basis.'" Anay Shah (02:01:54): "'—just give people the end result that they want and demystify everything that's happening.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:02:00): That's right. And he ends with: "We must respond quickly and decisively." For a company of Microsoft's scale and history, that was really trying to be a... Anay Shah (02:02:09): Wake-up call. And didn't Gates and Ballmer kind of give Ray Ozzie a blank slate, like, "You're the leader here. Help us understand where the future is"? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:02:17): Not just that, they let him carve out and run this separate from the Microsoft Server and Tools business, which had built Windows Server and SQL Server—which would have been the obvious place to try these things. But they knew that this was bigger than an evolution from what they were doing in their previous software business. This was a transformation: a fundamentally different product, a different business model, and a different go-to-market motion. So when everything had to change like that, it was very hard for the leader of the incumbent thing to keep going. Let's make this concrete. What does this mean for a server or a data center? Microsoft had Windows Server and SQL Server. When we talked about those server rooms that a company would run, they would very often be running Microsoft software. This was the IT sale they had perfected by this point. You would sell the Windows Server license, it would be Active Directory, it would be running Exchange and Outlook for your email, and it would be running your calendar and all these things inside your company's network. It'd be running Windows on their PCs. Anay Shah (02:03:15): So it's this beautifully connected thing. And this is saying, "No, no, no, we've got to move that server from your bottom line CapEx as a company into OpEx in our data centers." This is a transformational move from what you're providing at the end of the day—from just software that's going to run on someone else's computer—to actual services. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:03:32): Ray Ozzie goes for it. He staffs up a team they call Project Red Dog. They bring in Dave Cutler, who had previously led Windows NT and is a legendary programmer, to help lead the architecture of this new project. Anay Shah (02:03:46): So they're putting together this cloud strategy that is revamping Microsoft internally, and at the same time, ramping up direct competition to the front door of the Internet: Google. They evolved an old MSN Search product into what then became Live Search and eventually Bing, as we know it, in 2009. This was a moment that kind of rippled across the industry, especially for Google's dominance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:12): I was at Microsoft at this time. Anay Shah (02:04:13): Oh, yeah. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:14): I joined Microsoft out of college in 2008 and was there in this moment: they had Windows Live Search. They briefly called it Live Search, then came this big rebrand to Bing. Microsoft was willing to spend a lot on this repositioning, on this marketing—so much so that they gave Yahoo a very sweet deal to power Yahoo's search and ads and gain some infrastructure market share. Anay Shah (02:04:35): This catapulted them into getting up to 20% share, which is no small feat in an exploding market that Google has been dominating. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:45): It's important to remember that doing search well and search ads well is a really hard scale problem that essentially only one other company had cracked, and that was Google. To respond quickly with an active, updated index of the internet, and to do this auction for the right ad unit—all of these things that you have to build—is what propelled Google to build their vertically integrated servers. And Microsoft was now putting themselves in the position of having to solve those same really hard technical problems, in addition. Anay Shah (02:05:12): To those really hard technical problems, we saw with Google that in order to effectively run this search business, you have to have a lot of compute power behind you. You now have to get into the data center business and build out infrastructure that is your own to drive down the cost and drive up performance. We mentioned Christian Bellady previously. He was at HP in 2007, gets a recruiting call from Microsoft, and his initial reaction is, "What the hell's a mechanical engineer going to do at Microsoft?" Because Microsoft is known as the software company, and so he turns them down a couple times. After the third call, he decides to go up for an interview, enjoys the process, gets an offer, but doesn't think much of it. And I believe he's at his parents' house when he suddenly gets an email from Bill G. (Bill@microsoft.com) explaining why he should accept the job offer. And Bill essentially says, "Everything's going to the cloud. We're investing for the cloud business, and we need to build out this new infrastructure as core to the future of Microsoft." Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:06:24): This seems like a wacky idea to go there, but Bill G emailing me? Like, you're there with your parents, and you've got to give this a go. Let's pack our things, move to the Seattle area, and join Microsoft. And so at this point, he starts there, and Microsoft had just finished building their first real, more integrated data center build-out. This is in Quincy, Washington, in Eastern Washington, a 13-megawatt build. And he walks in there, and everyone's looking around, and the first thought they have is, "We're going to get fired because there's no way we're going to fill this thing with servers." There's just no way that we have the demand. Anay Shah (02:07:00): And this was their first massive-scale, purpose-built cloud data center campus. This was Microsoft entering the infrastructure business. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:07:11): And similar to what we saw with Google at The Dalles, a lot of the same things that attracted them to Quincy were power from the same Columbia River. They're getting cheap 1.9-cent per kilowatt-hour power at the time to power this. And the climate was that dry, cool climate that allowed them to be really economical with using outside air cooling for much of the year. They had multiple fiber routes. It's in Washington, so they could connect their Redmond headquarters directly to Quincy. Anay Shah (02:07:34): The environment, the fiber, the power—it all comes together. And they, like Google, knew they had to work with the local community and the local government. And so they actually worked with the City of Quincy to build a Quincy water reuse system to treat and recirculate the cooling water to reduce the dependence on the local community. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:07:53): They built Quincy. They have it up and running. He's worried they're not going to fill it, but they kept going. Azure ends up launching in 2008, which we'll talk about in a moment. But I think it's very easy for a big company that's bet a lot of resources building something internally to think that they have an idea of what demand is going to look like. But they overbuilt in Chicago. Then they had it mothballed, they tried to sell it, and then nine months later, they were so happy. They didn't sell it because they needed the space. Anay Shah (02:08:16): It was hilarious. They tried to sell it to the government. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:08:18): So, what's going on there, and what's happening, is they're launching this project, 'Red Dog,' which would become known as Microsoft Azure. And it's hard to predict the scale of the utilization of infrastructure as you launch it. So let's go back to October 2008—the big reveal. This is Microsoft's big annual Professional Developers Conference, and Microsoft unveils not Microsoft Azure at the time, but Windows Azure. Anay Shah (02:08:46): And this wasn't just Windows running somewhere else. It's a platform for developers to build and host applications on Microsoft infrastructure, paying only for what they used. Rent some storage and compute, pay for what you use. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:09:00): And the key thing that you mentioned is, it was designed for those Windows developers. So it used all the familiar tools: the .NET Framework and Visual Studio and all these things. And it made it easy for you to take your work that you'd done over there that would run on Windows Server right inside of your office, and take that same code and shift it to run on Microsoft servers. What a powerful integration and move! It kind of split the thread between AWS, which gave these really basic building blocks—S3 and EC2—of this unopinionated 'run your own operating system, bring your own full thing, and we'll just make it work' approach. Anay Shah (02:09:35): Right. They were agnostic to what you were doing on top of it and how you were doing it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:09:37): Exactly. To Google App Engine, which was overly specific and cute about it, in a way Microsoft was almost more Google's approach, but it was the same code and the same thing that a developer had already used. And so they had this massive developer ecosystem and integrators, and this whole kind of motion around it. Anay Shah (02:09:54): It wasn't just easy for the developer community; this is Microsoft that has an enterprise sales engine. They've got a go-to-market motion. They have the finance department that knows how the sales team is going to operate and how to budget for it. And so they're bringing this world-class distribution and, most importantly, the trust from this massive customer base to bear with Azure. And the adoption is extremely rapid because people are already embedded in the ecosystem, and here you are coming with an improved product, and the enterprise base adopts it very seamlessly. Yeah. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:10:28): And it's not the story that Amazon has to make for the first time, which is, "Hey, come build your thing with us in the cloud," and introduce this. This is four or five years later, and it's sitting there like, "How do we think about the cloud?" We don't have an agreement with Amazon; that's not an existing vendor relationship. Whereas with Microsoft, you're like, "This is the agreement we have, this is the IT relationship we have, this is the full trust." If you're telling us this is how we can move to the cloud in a seamless, secure, safe way that's going to integrate with Active Directory and Outlook, and I just don't have to run the machines in my closet anymore? Sign me up. Ironically, I think some of the people they had the hardest time signing up were the engineers and product managers in Redmond, Washington. We were actually talking with Ben Gilbert of Acquired about this, and he at the time (this was 2012, 2013) was working on the web version of Microsoft Word. So Microsoft is finally going to compete head-to-head with Google Docs on product and ship a version of Word that you can use via your browser. And of course, the desire was for everyone to use Azure. Did they? Absolutely not. They said, "No. This is the custom server we need. We need this. Many of them can scale this big, and we had to do some custom JavaScript rendering, all this stuff." We want our own servers, probably still in Quincy, but we're not using the Azure APIs and layers. Anay Shah (02:11:43): So the own employees are demanding all this heterogeneity, resulting in a wide variety of server SKUs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:11:52): Amazon, for context, building out AWS, I think had something like 20 different types of machines that were running AWS. Google, in their whole build-out, standardized on this vertically integrated, commodity-built server design. And so they would just keep it down to a handful of machine types. So supposedly at Microsoft, there were dozens and dozens of different SKUs that Microsoft was maintaining. So instead of calling this a server farm, someone called it a server zoo. You just think about where they're coming from in the evolution of all these different web services and different teams building their own thing. It's a whole different world. And around this time, I think energy starts to become an interesting layer as well. Anay Shah (02:12:31): So similar to Christian getting recruited in 2007, thinking, 'What the hell am I going to do at Microsoft?' he then goes out to recruit an energy expert. Brian Janes. In 2011, Microsoft saw the need for an energy person to be in-house. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:12:47): I'd say Microsoft saw the need, but I think Brian was confused. Anay Shah (02:12:51): Brian was like, 'I do energy, you don't need an energy person.' And his thought was, 'This is a dead-end job.' Being an energy person at a software company doesn't make sense because what they're trying to do is all about land, it's all about fiber. Energy's a distant third or lower down the list in the priority of how you think about scaling this type of infrastructure. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:13:10): Yeah, I think at this time, for context, utilities were happy you'd show up with your 10 Quincy, 13-megawatt data center, and utilities are like, 'Sure, great, sign up!' Anay Shah (02:13:20): Yeah, generally power demand is relatively flat. There's excess power available, and they're happy to sign you up and increase their profits because it's not going to drive any new infrastructure needs on their end yet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:13:34): And how things change! This is 2011, 2012. Fast forward a little more than a decade to where we are now, and we'll get there. Anay Shah (02:13:43): But Brian took the job and ended up building a phenomenal team. And within a few years, his team was actually the decision-maker of where they were going to build out Microsoft infrastructure. And so it's a lead-in to us actually starting to care about where our energy is coming from and the whole complexity around where you're sourcing and doing these clean energy build-outs that Brian's team was leading. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:03): The team thought it was a real kind of planning challenge, right? And so they're bringing this up to leadership around, 'Hey, we need a lot of money to invest now to build this out.' Anay Shah (02:14:12): They're doing their annual budgets, they're projecting years in advance, they're getting into their mid-year review. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:19): Microsoft's in this weird transitional phase. They have Bing that they're still growing; they have other services. Xbox is booming, Azure is still early innings. So it's not the dominant use of their internal server build-out, but it's a lot of different teams to juggle and predict. And so this forecasting challenge is a real one. You bring this to leadership, and what are you there to say? Anay Shah (02:14:38): And you've talked to all the business groups to figure out what they're thinking, and you go to Ballmer with your prepared notes, and within a few sentences you get interrupted, and Steve Ballmer's like, 'Ah, the business groups don't know what they need. Let me tell you how to do this.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:52): And he says, "Give me the Excel sheet. You just draw a straight line from how growth has been going the last few years, and you just project it out, and you just build the data centers that that line shows you to do." Anay Shah (02:15:04): Just a straight line from here to 2020. The business groups, they don't know what the plan is. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:08): There's actually a lot of wisdom to what Ballmer's saying because you realize that every team is trying to be excited about what they're building and Azure is going to have all this demand, but no one really knows—especially more than 12, maybe 18 months out. So how can you plan if you're building long-term, multi-year build-outs for what anyone's going to need? Anay Shah (02:15:28): This moment of growth? It was quite difficult. And Janes' team found that he was consistently under-forecasting. But he did go back many, many years later, and he was kind of curious: how accurate were his forecasts compared to the straight line in 2020? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:43): He looked back, and Ballmer was off by how much? Anay Shah (02:15:46): 5%. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:47): 5%. So they should have just followed the line. So sure enough, Microsoft keeps at it, and the power team at Microsoft—the data center team at Microsoft—becomes one of the biggest builders in this industry. They shift from leasing square footages to megawatt-based deals, as they become a major, major hyperscaler. Anay Shah (02:16:08): There's a big learning journey for them, right, because they were a software company, and they had to grow very quickly into an infrastructure company. It was not an easy pivot to make, and they had to do that globally. The Microsoft team had the blessing of this entrenched enterprise customer base that was very loyal, very profitable, and very global. And so their go-to-market strategy was actually to follow their customers. And that meant that within a few years of launching Azure, they were getting calls from customers in Frankfurt, in Amsterdam, in Singapore. If their German multinational had data sovereignty questions, Microsoft would go and stand up capacity in the region. And so by 2015, they had announced over 20 regions, which was actually more than Amazon at this time. Each anchored on an interconnection-rich metro and typically supported by entering with colocation facilities—perhaps the Digital Realties of the world—before moving on to dedicated Microsoft campuses once they built up enough critical demand. But this go-to-market strategy forced them to innovate and expand all over the globe, and it drove massive results quite quickly. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:17:33): And to that point, you fast forward to today, and Microsoft's business is in significant part the Azure business. Azure is a core growth driver. It's now 75 billion of revenue a year and growing 40% year-over-year. And so this company that was 'the software company' ('we write software, we sell software, those are our core platforms, those are our products, that's what we do') is no longer just a software company; they are, in large part, a data center company. So we've gone through AWS, Google and GCP, Microsoft and Azure. But there was another company that many thought for many, many years was just a toy. Let's talk about Facebook. Anay Shah (02:18:16): The Facebook, the Facebook. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:18:19): In February 2004, Facebook's running out of a single server in Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard University. Early days caused crashes. In fact, many of his earlier products, including FaceMash, the 'hot or not' for Harvard campus, melted down the servers in the Kirkland House, and the IT department at Harvard was not pleased. But then it becomes a real company, right? Anay Shah (02:18:40): And they start expanding to other campuses, and you've got different schools putting on different servers in different data centers. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:18:49): In a way that I think creates automatic resiliency because if the server crashed for, whatever, Penn, it's not going to bring down Harvard. Anay Shah (02:18:56): And this isn't their concern, right? They're building this viral, game-changing platform that is exploding, probably beyond their expectations. And new campuses are signing up. So they're not really concerned about the infrastructure, but it's just growing organically. By the time they launch News Feed, you've got hundreds of millions of people refreshing this site, uploading photos by the billions, opening up Messenger just as a reflex of the thumb. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:19:23): And the company's spending all this money; they raised VC dollars and they're not happy spending all this money on fancy servers and colo cages. Anay Shah (02:19:29): And so they're realizing, 'Why is everyone making so much money on us?' There's got to be a better way to do this. And there are two broad ways that they go about this. One is similar to what we've seen with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which is the thought that, 'Hey, we can do this better, cheaper if we build our own custom data center.' And so their first purpose-built facility was announced on January 10th and began operations in 2011 in Prineville, Oregon. And they soon followed with North Carolina, Sweden, and Iowa, and expanded rapidly. But Prineville was, just like all the others, quite intentional and quite strategic. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:20:09): Yeah. And so similarly, in this kind of Northwest region, you had cheap power, you had a dry, cool climate, and you had Oregon's incentives starting to come into play where they offered long property tax abatements on any improvements they made. All of this combined to make a great site for their first 'Lighthouse' data center. And if you look at the numbers of server growth, if you go back just to 2008, they had 10,000 servers; in 2009, 30,000 servers. Supposedly by 2010, when they are really kicking off and building the Prineville project, they have around 60,000 servers. They're trying to figure out how to scale up. Anay Shah (02:20:42): And so they decide to engineer the building and the servers together. This very purpose-built facility. And just like the others, they realized that they can beat industry standards. And so they very famously and publicly came out with this first purpose-built facility with a very aggressive target of a 1.15 PUE. Industry average is 1.5. Historically, they were north of 2, and they were able to report 38% less energy, 25% lower cost against prior facilities. And do you think they ended up beating their PUE? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:15): No way. Anay Shah (02:21:16): Smoked it: 1.07. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:20): So that means that only 7% of the energy going to run the data center went to anything other than powering the IT equipment. That is phenomenal. Anay Shah (02:21:30): Amazing. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:30): Did they keep this to themselves, how they did this? I think this is what sets Facebook's approach apart. Anay Shah (02:21:38): This first part they needed to do, and they executed extremely well. But the second thing they did was far more revolutionary. In a very secretive world of data center development where each hyperscaler kept their builds to themselves, in April of 2011, Facebook open sourced their blueprints. They announced the Open Compute Project. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:22:01): It's hard to overstate how radically different an approach this was. This is an industry that kept the design of the servers in the data centers extremely secretive. They viewed that as core IP, differentiation, and notions of security. Google would publish papers, especially on things like PUE, and be visible about metrics that they wanted to highlight. But they famously didn't let anyone into their data centers until this really changed the game. Anay Shah (02:22:29): Their motivation is pretty interesting. They look around at all the other big data center companies and they're seeing all the margins that are being made. They're like, 'Well, wait a minute, if we publish our blueprints and we get everyone else to buy in and publish theirs, that means we can drive down the costs by standardizing what we're building.' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:22:50): Ultimately, what they want is for their suppliers to be in increased competition. The best way to do that is not to make one deal with one supplier, but to say, 'Hey, suppliers, this is what we need, this is what we like. You make this, we'll buy it as long as it's the cheapest one out there.' Anay Shah (02:23:04): Yeah, it flips the power dynamic. Now, instead of the vendors and suppliers dictating what the specs are and having multiple different specs for multiple different customers, they're able to standardize it and say, 'You're going to respond to the Open Compute Project standards.' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:23:17): And it was directionally aligned with all the innovation that we saw at Google. There's actually a big parallel echo here, right? Google built all of these in-house software orchestration tools that we talked about that made the data center reliable. Facebook grew up in that open-source world and benefited from that, and was able to build on top of that. So it's not surprising that they're the ones to look at the hardware design and say, 'Why is this any different? We don't want to be the sole developers of this part of our infrastructure.' It actually benefits us to have other developers and the ecosystem in part because — and this really gets to a business model motivation — we're not trying to sell that innovation. We're not trying to sell anything to another business other than ads on our feed. The better and the cheaper this infrastructure is, the better our business margins are going to be. Anay Shah (02:24:05): Yeah, we want to take this cost item and reduce it, so we can put more of our budget, more of our focus, onto the core business. They're looking at it and they're like, 'Well, the industry is using a 19-inch rack because that's what the telcos did.' 'Well, that's not suiting what we needed. There's no reason for the 19-inch rack. It was just a legacy element.' So Facebook decides to do it differently. They widen it to 21 inches and publish that to make it more efficient and fit their needs better. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:24:33): It's this funny thing how companies are open strategically, so it's important to be clear-eyed about what they're open about and what they're not. Would Facebook publish publicly the exact way that their News Feed ranking works? No. But that's very different than this infrastructure layer that benefits them when the ecosystem adopts it. I think one thing that's amazing about it is how much the industry rallied around it and started to join it. OCP ripples across the industry. Microsoft starts bringing their designs into it. Google contributes big improvements, like we talked about, their 48-volt design. Telcos and everyone joins this, and it has the intended desired flywheel effect. Anay Shah (02:25:12): It did normalize the idea of transparency, and this was right around the time where companies like Google at first were publishing their PUE. So, this notion that we can be transparent with our results as a way to drive the industry forward, bring down costs, and make this whole part of the business easier for everyone, spurred more competition. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:25:33): This kicked off the sustainability race among these four hyperscalers. I would say this started all the way back in 2007 when Google announced that they would achieve operational carbon neutrality. Anay Shah (02:25:43): Each of the companies followed, and they were serious. Right? Microsoft committed to carbon-neutral operations in 2012. It drove site selection, their power purchase agreements, and how they negotiated and determined who they were going to work with and their relationship with their utilities. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:26:01): And it just accelerates. Amazon kicks off the Climate Pledge to get net-zero by 2040. You have zero-waste goals. Microsoft announced water-positive by 2030 in 2020. Google catches up with a similar announcement a year later. So you just have this era of accelerating commitments and goals. I think it's good to ask, why is this? Does it just feel good? Having worked at some of these companies, I do genuinely think the leadership wants the company to have a positive environmental impact, and it is the economically right thing to do as well. These goals of efficiency lead to your data centers, which are a growing item of operational scale, costing you less and less. The other thing this does is catalyze different renewable buying and procurement habits, right? These teams, like the one led by Brian Janis at Microsoft, become energy-buying procurement machines. They're looking to help accelerate that next solar project, that next wind project, to then be able to buy — via what's called a virtual power purchase agreement — the accounting for the clean electrons. Google pushes this even one step further to say, 'Hey, we want to buy electrons that are generated at the same time that our data center is using electrons.' So we want this notion of 24/7 carbon-free electricity. This really pushes the clean energy ecosystem forward, I think, in a material way. If we look at these three commercial cloud businesses of AWS, GCP, and Azure, they are behemoths, as we said. Azure hit $75 billion last year, GCP surpassed $50 billion, and AWS was on a run rate of $111 billion for that business. You total that up, that's $236 billion a year spent only on the direct cloud infrastructure businesses. Anay Shah (02:27:51): Let's put this in perspective. That's $236 billion across these three companies spent on the infrastructure. US consumers spend $500 billion annually on electricity. So we're talking about half the spend of all residential electricity across this country. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:28:10): So I think it is safe to say that we have now entered the utility era of computing. It just so happens that the utilities are Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Meanwhile, Meta, first of all, doesn't want to buy power from those three utilities. They also use so much themselves that they want to build their own and have no interest in selling access to it. They just need their own data centers to run everything that they're doing in-house at such an immense scale. So we end the 2010s with a very mature cloud, right? I think it's almost in the background. People don't even need to talk about and explain the cloud anymore. It's like, 'Of course, this is how you're going to start and run your company.' The functionality is all grown up. All of the companies are now running containerized Kubernetes things. Your services are portable. Yes, they have their functional differences and their sales differences, but they're all kind of mature and stable, multi-region. All of this stuff going on. Anay Shah (02:29:04): Nobody asks, 'Do you have a cloud strategy anymore?' It just is the way business is done. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:29:08): You also have the new startups that have built out the missing pieces. You have the Snowflakes of the world that are helping build more specialized databases. You have Datadog helping you with orchestration — real significant public-scale businesses that have built the missing components of the cloud moment. Anay Shah (02:29:23): And the feeling right now is one of maturity of the cloud infrastructure, maturity of a new large-scale data center build-out, and at the same time, a huge pressure to continue to build. There is a global race; it is fierce, it is competitive, and it has many, many more players than just these hyperscalers. To give you a sense, Microsoft scaled from 35 regions to 75 regions over the period of a couple of years. So they were adding an entire region a month. This is data center region build-outs. Deal size was ballooning at the same time. A decade ago, a large lease might have been 5 megawatts. You fast forward to the end of the 2010s, and every one of the hyperscalers is reserving 100-megawatt campuses. So, a 20x growth in the size of the data center over this decade. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:30:21): These two big points fit. The whole idea that the cloud now can be taken for granted and invisible is because of these scaled, global build-outs. You don't get to do that if the thing isn't just working as usage is exploding across the entire industry. Anay Shah (02:30:35): The industry has matured around private equity money coming in. You've got developers treating this as a real estate asset class, and they're stockpiling land, pre-building substations ahead of demand because they know what the hyperscaler or the next large company is going to need, and they're going to snap up that capacity. So this build-out is fierce on land. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:30:56): Not only is it fierce on land, it's fierce in the seas. It's not enough just to have your own servers and your own buildings and your own power infrastructure. You need confidence that you can stay connected. The best way to have confidence is to put your own cables underwater. So instead of just renting capacity, which of course they continue to do, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and others start financing and building their own undersea network. This way, they can control end-to-end. You think about Google's vertical integration: it starts with the box, it goes to the rack, then it goes to the building, then it goes to the campus, then it goes to the wires that connect the campus. That's how you get confidence in what you're building. This leads to improved economics and improved performance. Anay Shah (02:31:38): And performance continues to drive forward. But by the end of the 2010s, PUE had plateaued around an incredible 1.1. Only 10% of the power being used in this facility is not directly for the server and IT equipment. So, as we talked about in the sustainability race, the bragging rights had shifted. The marketing teams had moved off of PUE, and now they're talking about carbon intensity (CUE). Now we're talking about water intensity (WUE), and the holy grail metric here is who is launching 24/7 real-time renewable-powered data centers. Everyone's putting out their climate pledges, building into their plans, and driving the entire renewable energy and PPA world forward through this genuine focus on carbon intensity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:32:28): Intensity. The cloud by 2020 was doing what it needed to do. So we now had this scaled, mature global technology for storing things, computing things, connecting all of us, streaming content, and powering video calls. Why might that be helpful as we go into 2020? Anay Shah (02:32:48): Well, Ben, we're now upon everyone's favorite moment in recent history: the dark days of the COVID pandemic — a time where we all had to stay at home and a time where society, systems, public health, everything was stretched to the max. The same actually goes for our data center infrastructure. While the 2010s saw fast, consistent growth of cloud computing, COVID compressed five years of adoption into about 18 months with everyone at home. Video calls, gaming, online collaboration, telehealth, e-commerce, SaaS — everything surged all at once. We all remember the endless video calls, but let's put that into perspective a little bit. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:33:35): Going into this era, Zoom had something like 10 million folks as daily meeting participants. Fast forward to March 2020: they hit 200 million in four months. One month later, 300 million. So, just explosive growth. Google Meet similarly saw 3 million new users per day in April. Peak usage was up 30x since January, and gaming was exploding. They're at home, looking for entertainment, so Steam is shattering records. Anay Shah (02:34:03): Netflix and YouTube famously had to throttle down the network speed to lower resolutions to avoid essentially breaking the Internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:34:11): I was at Stripe at the time, and to the e-commerce point, it was just this explosive moment where, sure, you saw some businesses, perhaps in travel in particular, struggle and go under. But the majority of Stripe's users were exploding. Everyone was ordering stuff online. Instacart and DoorDash were booming. It's easy to say five years of growth in 18 months. What does it actually feel like when you're working on the infrastructure? It feels like everything is breaking, and you're trying to make sure no one in the outside world feels it. We managed to accomplish that, and I'm very proud of that. The API stayed up, and payments were processed even as they scaled rapidly. Anay Shah (02:34:45): Another company in the crosshairs that seized the day was obviously Zoom. They had to scale infrastructure from 10 million to 300 million users in months. They added servers in colocation metros, they used AWS, they used Azure, and they expanded aggressively on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. They were just doing everything they could to ensure that those video calls didn't have delays. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:35:09): Under the hood, the way Zoom works, you can think of it split into two: the Zoom Control Plane, which was making sure that it would respond to your logins and understand what you are as a participant in a meeting. But then you actually had the video feed, and that would have these meeting zones where Zoom would make sure to connect you to the closest meeting zone in a carrier-dense building. So it's kind of very similar to the CDN networks that we talked about earlier with Netflix, but it had this dual, bi-directional nature to it. They were in a race to add more of these peering machines in those telco hotels that we talked about earlier. Anay Shah (02:35:41): And Zoom became proof that the cloud's elastic promise was real. In the greatest stress test of its time, capacity could materialize as fast as humanity demanded it. This was the moment. We were in an era of exploding demand, and there are a few key themes that affect the data center world in this moment. One of them is famously known as ZIRP. On March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its target rate to the range of 0 to 25 basis points. What does that mean in the infrastructure world? That basically lowers the hurdle rate for your risk for speculative builds. So now campuses and shells can be built out way ahead of leases being signed because the carrying cost of that infrastructure was so low, because your cost of capital is so low. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:36:33): You're buying a house. This was the time when your interest rate on the mortgage was as low as possible, so you could buy more house. Well, if you are a company trying to build data centers, it's the same story. You can buy more data centers. Your same amount of principal is going to go much further in building out more. Anay Shah (02:36:50): As a company in this infrastructure environment, you can take more risk. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:36:54): The hyperscalers took advantage of this and started pouring money into building new data centers. But so did Blackstone. In 2021, Blackstone purchased QTS Realty Trust, one of the largest data center builders in the industry, for $10 billion. Anay Shah (02:37:07): There's so much capital floating around, and the beauty of the data center asset class was that it had started to look very predictable. It was looking like utility-style returns. Everyone's investing in the REITs and the infrastructure debt. This is fantastic for the counties that were building this out, namely Loudoun County, which we've talked about before. Right? Their budgets were suffering in the COVID era, but because they're Data Center Alley, they saw their server equipment tax go past $400 million annually, and that prevented them from needing to raise property taxes to fill their budget gaps. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:37:46): I think at some point their vacancy was below 1% in all of this. So there's just so much demand for space, colocation, interconnection. Everything is just flying off the shelves. Anay Shah (02:37:56): Another major theme here is what is defining the build-out. What you find now is that it starts to grow the panic around the urgency for electrical supply. It was both the amount of supply of power that you want, as well as the time to power, because there is this capital looking to go to work. The question was actually, 'How soon can you get me the power?' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:38:23): This is new, right? The scale of the data centers earlier — these 5, 10, 15-megawatt data centers — didn't necessitate a big conversation with the utility. We're now talking into the 50 to 100-megawatt builds, and this changes the dynamic with suppliers. We had folks in Ireland saying for the first time, 'We're going to pass regulation that says the utility can block a data center from coming in because it's too much load.' Anay Shah (02:38:47): You can't just walk up to a utility and plug in for 100 megawatts. For the first time, grid capacity and planning was a throttling factor in how fast data infrastructure could grow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:39:01): The era from 2010 to 2018-2019, which was this big shift to the cloud that we talked about, was one of increased efficiency in these systems that ended up balancing out the increase in demand and capacity. So there's actually relatively flat power-use growth despite there being so much growth. While there was more demand, it was a steady increase, and the efficiency jumps could go in concert with the growth jumps. Anay Shah (02:39:30): So you buy a new phone, you buy a new computer — most of it's all the same, except you just get more processing power because of Moore's Law. That brought about these efficiency gains. We were building a lot of new data centers and compute, but total energy consumption of data centers actually remained relatively flat throughout this period. It was largely due to a few factors. One is that we moved into the... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:39:54): ...cloud, and everything we talked about earlier with utilization can then come into play, right? Anay Shah (02:39:59): Exactly. One study found that the cloud is 93% more efficient than running your compute power on-premises because you have less wasted assets combined with everything we talked about with PUE and driving down that efficiency. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:14): Well, now all of a sudden you had COVID plus ZIRP, where you're not waiting to get more efficient; you're just trying to build more and more. Anay Shah (02:40:22): We'd also kind of run out of that low-hanging fruit, right? PUE is at 1.1. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:28): So if you look at the big four that we talked about before — Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta — between 2017 and 2021, in those four years, they doubled their energy use to 72 terawatt-hours in 2021. Anay Shah (02:40:40): So much greater demand, combined with a loss of the PUE benefits and the cloud efficiency, means we're in a new paradigm of power usage, and the industry is having to reckon with that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:52): It's pretty amazing that we had such a flat period for how much growth that we just talked through. I mean, the whole scale-up of the cloud led to growing usage, while the efficiency gains were so significant. We've run out of those tricks. Right? Anay Shah (02:41:05): Right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:06): The hot and cold aisles are contained. We've virtualized everything; we've containerized everything. We need to come up with some new tricks. I hold out some optimism that necessity is the mother of invention, and we'll figure out some new tricks because we'll have to. Anay Shah (02:41:18): We have to. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:20): That being said, there is an extreme way that a new power user is showing up in this era. Let's talk about the crypto miners for a bit. Anay Shah (02:41:29): Let's talk a little bit about crypto because it's not just a hobby, but actually ends up being a competitive buyer in the data center infrastructure build-out. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:40): By 2022, 100 to 150 terawatt hours. So that's almost 50% of what the rest of the data centers are consuming now going to crypto mining. Go back to 2009, Bitcoin launches, and it's pretty much just a dark corners of the internet thing, right? Someone mining on a PC in their bedroom. Then, finally, folks figure if you buy GPUs off the shelf, you can go faster, and people start even designing custom ASICs that are designed to do nothing but mine Bitcoin and other coins. By the mid-2010s, mines had become significant power loads, and folks had started to build these out wherever they could find cheap electricity. Anay Shah (02:42:14): And while the technology behind crypto was interesting from a business perspective, it was less of an IT business and more of a power arbitrage business, because it was all based on how efficiently you could mine and where you're doing it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:42:29): Hard math computation as many times as you can. This is purely solving problems using power. And this is very, very different than everything we've said about data centers before. This is just compute as cheaply as possible. Anay Shah (02:42:43): And this really comes to a collision point in the real world where you had markets like Iceland and Eastern Washington where Bitcoin miners were outbidding these cloud providers for the cheap hydro and the power that was available. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:42:57): Then the crypto industry starts to realize that there's power that's not useful to others. Let's look for ways and places to put crypto mining that you couldn't even put a data center or a normal industrial load. You're in an oil field and you're flaring excess gas. What if you put a turbine there, burn that, and power a crypto mine? This is how Crusoe, which later became one of the premier AI data center build-outs, got started finding that cheap power source. And so, it's interesting how many of these power-related innovations came from the crypto moment. Anay Shah (02:43:27): Then, crypto loads were different. They were large, but they were fairly mobile. So that was an advantage in terms of where and how quickly they could place. But it also meant that policy could step in and shape the industry fairly quickly. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:43:39): By 2021, most crypto mining was happening in China. There was the cheapest power. It was close to where the hardware was being manufactured. But in 2021, China cracked down. There was no more crypto mining. So all the miners fled to Texas, to Kazakhstan, to Canada. And so, by early 2022, the US share of crypto miners was back up to almost 40%. This is up from 3 to 4% in 2020. Anay Shah (02:44:03): What started out as a hobby and took over the fintech world and financial infrastructure forced real estate, power, and the compute industry to wrestle with how to connect very large, very flexible loads to stressed grids. And what innovations can be born out of trying to wrestle with that. On that point, crypto as an industry didn't care much about its footprint. But the rest of the industry, and the data center industry in particular, continued to be very focused on the carbon intensity of their operations. Now, these hyperscalers were tracking their carbon footprints with extreme precision. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:44:40): By 2020, Amazon became the world's largest buyer of renewable energy. It's a scale thing. Amazon signed the climate pledge. And for Amazon to hit net zero, they didn't just have to decarbonize their data centers and offices; they had fulfillment centers and travel of unprecedented scale, delivering all the packages. Anay Shah (02:44:59): And this is beyond just the quote-unquote "right thing to do." As we've talked about, oftentimes the cheapest, most economical way to get new load onto the grid and scale is through renewable power. And in a zero-interest-rate environment, it actually makes these PPAs more and more attractive, and it lowers the hurdle rate. So, a wind project that might otherwise have been too expensive in this environment is profitable and able to be signed on to a Microsoft new build-out. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:45:30): It's hard to appreciate the flywheel of more demand for the data center services driving data center build-out, which can be funded by a zero-interest-rate environment, which then all drives all the renewable energy build-out, which is similarly funded by the zero-interest-rate environment. You just had an infrastructure build flywheel running that set us all up for what might come next. Anay Shah (02:45:53): It was an extremely timely moment in the evolution of data centers and actually served as a dress rehearsal for the unprecedented scale that we are going to see in the AI boom. This moment during COVID, with cheap capital flooding the system, was driving a massive new build-out. Power was starting to become a much more limiting reagent in the development of our infrastructure, and there was a breaking down of our global supply chains which was feeding this build-out. All this happened at this moment, right before a massive boom. So, now we've spoken about the companies building the big infrastructure, the big servers powering our life, and we have a $4 trillion elephant in the room that I think it's time to introduce. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:46:40): It's now time to talk about Nvidia. Nvidia started as a company that was trying to figure out how to make gaming run faster on computers. So, they made gaming chips. They did this for years and years and years. And I remember them recruiting many a student out of the Stanford EE department to go work on gaming chips. Anay Shah (02:46:59): They were very much tied to the gaming industry. Their growth was correlated to it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:05): But it turns out the same thing that you're doing in a game — which is doing a bunch of math to figure out how to render a pixel on a screen — is what you sometimes need to do complex science: a bunch of tough math problems at once. And if you're going to build a cryptocurrency, what are you doing? As we said earlier: a bunch of tough math problems at once. Anay Shah (02:47:21): A lot of compute, matrix multiplication at... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:24): Scale, to such an extent that their stock price starts to get tied to what's going on in crypto mining. Anay Shah (02:47:29): First, they had been tied to the game industry; now they became even more correlated to crypto. And then, in 2018, you have the crypto winter. That fall in the crypto industry dragged Nvidia's stock down 17% in one day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:45): Over that period, they got cut in half. Anay Shah (02:47:47): And so, enter COVID, and you hit a crypto boom-bust cycle. But machine learning algorithms are spitting out more and more recommendations to us as we're sitting on YouTube and Netflix and Instagram. And you know what powers a recommendation model? An Nvidia GPU. And so, growth of these training models takes off. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:08): And you can see it as a line item, right? In their earnings, they have this carve-out for what they call their data center business, which is really the growth of this business. You see 60% growth. Anay Shah (02:48:18): This hit nearly $4 billion in just a quarter. And this consisted mostly of their A100 chips. They were selling thousands of these. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:26): Right. And so, these A100 chips became the backbone of the early era of training models. So, in 2020, Microsoft announced the next stage of their partnership with OpenAI. They committed to buying 10,000 or more of these A100 chips to build a special data center, a special supercomputer for OpenAI to continue developing their models. And remember, at this time, OpenAI was not really a household name; it was... Anay Shah (02:48:47): ...a research project, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:48): Yeah, I mean, that's right. It was a leading, well-funded AI lab with this deep collaboration with Microsoft, building models that were available via API. And in the same year, they published a paper that really demonstrated something that they had discovered and what they call their scaling laws, showing that the bigger the compute and the larger the data set you threw at the problem, the better the model. And Google was discovering very much the same thing: the more chips, the better the model. Anay Shah (02:49:15): How convenient. The more chips, the better the model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:18): Music to Jensen's ears, I think. Anay Shah (02:49:21): Indeed. And so, in 2022, right as the crypto crash was coming, OpenAI released a new model, GPT-3.5. It was a huge upgrade from GPT-3, and they had built it in their new Microsoft data center. And they were thinking about new ways to show to the world the value of what they've been able to build. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:41): Are you saying not everyone wants to use an API sandbox to understand how good a model is? Anay Shah (02:49:45): Right now it's a little bit hard to access, but maybe if you put a simple box as a UI and create a little chat feature on the GPT, it'd be a... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:59): Nice demo at least, right? Anay Shah (02:50:00): Right. Few people might be interested, so they decided to put out this chat function. On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT launched. In five days, they had a million users. This was far and away beyond the team's expectations, as well as their capacity planning. According to Sam Altman, they expected an order of magnitude less interest by January 2023. ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. So, after getting a million users in five days, they crossed 100 million users in just two months. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:50:41): By this last summer, ChatGPT's website was among the top five most visited sites in the world, right after Instagram. So there was real consumer and enterprise pull. The world had been waiting for AI to be a thing for a very long time, but this was the moment where everyone said, "Okay, this is it. This is the time." Anay Shah (02:50:59): It ended up with over a billion prompts a day. People were loving this thing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:02): And everyone knew, to make it better, we just needed more chips. Why is Jensen so delighted? Where are we now? Anay Shah (02:51:09): Three years later, more chips, better models, right? Three years ago, in 2022, Nvidia's data center revenue was growing rapidly: $4 billion in revenue that quarter. Last quarter, their data center revenue was a staggering $39 billion. That's it growing nearly 10x from what it was in three years. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:30): To add $36 billion in quarterly revenue in three years, it's unprecedented. Anay Shah (02:51:37): This is powered by this discovery of the scaling laws. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:41): And the timing of their product launch could not have been better. They had the A100. That was essentially for training — scaling your training. But they launched the H100 in 2022. That was designed for this moment. It was the rocket boost of a chip. It added new special math modes tailored for transformers. It added more high-speed memory. As a result, it slashed training time and made inference faster. Anay Shah (02:52:07): And these H100s are flying off the shelf, from selling a million and a half in 2023 to over 2 million in 2024. And the big players, having learned from past years of the cloud boom and the COVID demand boom, are ordering these in the hundreds of thousands. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:52:23): These things are not cheap. Each chip is like a car, right? $40,000 apiece, supposedly. You couldn't buy one chip at a time. Anay Shah (02:52:32): No. Why would you sell one car at a time when you can put them in boxes? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:52:35): They really sold in two models, right? There are training boxes and inference boxes. The training box is an 8-GPU box with a CPU in the middle. They're hardwired with this NVLink connection. What's really interesting about this is it's all about making it effectively one big GPU. It's all about creating this really high-bandwidth connection between these GPUs. Because when you're training, that's what you want. In NVLink, if anyone's ever built a computer, you would have what's called a PCI connection in a motherboard. The way your Nvidia graphics card would plug into your computer was using PCI. It felt like a really fast connection. But it's not fast enough for this. So Nvidia invented NVLink. It's up to 15 times faster than that connection. So these eight GPUs can communicate extremely quickly. One training box is about $500K to buy. Then they also launched these inference boxes. And so, this is two GPUs coupled with a bunch of memory. To be clear, inference is when you're asking ChatGPT a question and it's responding. That process of responding is inference. You want a lot of memory to be able to understand all the content in that response. These boxes were designed with a lot of fast memory, connected to be able to share context across the model. Anay Shah (02:53:46): Now, selling these GPUs in a box actually has a physical space implication, right? So you've heard us talk about the racks and racks in the data center as far as the eye can see. These racks have slots for servers, and those servers have a traditional power consumption. But when you put in a specialized server, it starts to change the power consumption of that rack and therefore of the square footage and of the data center. So let's unpack, just for a moment, what's happening at the rack level when AI arrives. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:54:16): Historically, one rack would be maybe 400 watts. So you'd build a rack with 20 to 30 of these servers. You'd have some networking equipment. So, somewhere around 5 to 10 kilowatts of power going to a rack — that's like 10 hair dryers running at the same time, to give you a sense. Now, these GPU boxes arrived — those eight-GPU training boxes. Each of those is up to 10 kilowatts by itself. So it's the same power consumption and heat as the whole rack was. But you could now pack a rack physically with four to eight of those boxes. So, all of a sudden, you're an order of magnitude up in power consumption, up to 90 kilowatts in a rack. This has a bunch of implications, not just for power, but also for cooling. An inference box is somewhere in between; so a whole rack, maybe, is up to 40 kilowatts. Anay Shah (02:55:01): One of the things driving this power conversation we've been having is, again, not only the size of these data centers, but now the density of power required within these data centers. This is what makes an AI-driven data center so much different from a traditional data center. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:55:21): Just 20 of these training racks in a pod is one megawatt of power. That's on the order of a small, 800-person town powering electricity. So, if you get 200 of these racks, you get to an 8,000-person neighborhood very quickly. You get to a gigawatt of Seattle-scale power. Anay Shah (02:55:41): As you pack these GPUs that have higher power density, they run hotter, and you can't let them run hotter. So now, how you cool your GPUs and your racks needs to evolve. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:55:55): The problem is, air can only move heat so quickly. And if you were trying to do that, even with the inference racks, you would need leaf blower-level fans to move the air out. And so you need to start bringing more cooling down to the rack level. So the first thing that you can look at is retrofitting the racks with what's called rear door heat exchangers. This puts some water cooling directly alongside the rack so that when air is moving over those hot chips, some of that air, instead of just going straight into the hot aisle, can get extracted via some tubes of water running inside the rack. That is a nice convenient half-step because you don't have to change how you're actually cooling the overall system. The next jump is the jump to direct chip liquid cooling. This is where you mount cold plates directly on your chips and you run water right near the chip to actually extract the heat away, instead of expecting air and heat sinks to do it. And so, increasingly, especially with the most powerful GPUs—and to be clear, each generation of GPUs gets more powerful and therefore has more heat to remove—we are moving to a water-cooled world. Anay Shah (02:57:03): We've crossed the threshold of physics where air can cool this amount of heat being emitted at this level of density from the racks. And so now it is a liquid-cooling world. Now, at the end of the day, you've got to move the heat from inside to outside. But it's very environment-dependent. In the right climates, you can expel it outside. And that's why we saw some of these data centers looking at Finland and Oregon and certain geographies that enable that to happen. And this consumes very little water. But in other climates, you have large evaporated water cooling towers. This is where the problem of the water impact on the local community starts to come into play. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:57:45): Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is we're removing heat through that phase change, right? You're evaporating water; that's a massive transfer of heat. These towers increase the surface area of the water. Water evaporates out. It looks like steam going up from these cooling towers. And it's a very effective and efficient way to cool things down. But it can use up your water. Anay Shah (02:58:03): And so you end up with this energy-water trade-off in certain environments. And that becomes a big planning focus not only for data centers that are working with their local community, but also those that are power-constrained and built by companies that care about carbon intensity. One study Google did in 2022 found that water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy, which means they emit about 10% less carbon emissions than many of the air-cooled data centers. Now, the problem is, you can't do this as easily in water-stressed areas. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:58:38): So there's essentially this knob you can dial up and down. To be clear, it's possible to build data centers that don't use any water, but they're going to use more electricity to run an air conditioner in your house. You're not using a bunch of water, but you're taking a ton of energy. And so I would argue if we care about water, the best thing we can do is have clean electricity to make this an easier trade-off to make. Anay Shah (02:59:00): So if you zoom out and look at water, globally, data centers consume over 550 billion liters of water annually, which is a big number. To put that into context, a single 100-megawatt data center can consume 2 million liters a day, or the amount equivalent to 6,500 U.S. households per day, both direct and indirect water usage. So this is a very big, real, and current issue for data centers in terms of where they site their data center, how they get permitted, and the ongoing operations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:59:35): The local question is hyper-important. Some reporting that The New York Times did about the situation in Georgia where, supposedly, when Meta broke ground on their billion-dollar data center build-out, water taps in some residents nearby went dry. And there's some back and forth around whether or not you can prove direct causality. Still working out whether or not that is actually the case, caused by that data center. But it is known to be true that that data center is using about 10% of the county's total water and it's driving water prices in the region to go up. Anay Shah (03:00:06): So now let's dive into what is the largest constraint to data center build-outs today, and that is power. We've talked about the evolution of power moving up the decision stack. From the early 2010s through the COVID era, and now in the AI era, power is really the limiting reagent. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:00:30): The image in my mind is: we have the largest, most complex machine that humankind has built in the power grid that has brought us such evolution in how we live our life. And it is colliding with the new, complex, most interesting machine of the data center. And this collision and the force of it that we're living through right now is defining this period. Anay Shah (03:00:53): And it is no small collision. It is a function of two things, right? It's a function of speed and a function of scale. So, as we've seen, there is an absolute arms race on compute, because the faster you can get compute online, the better your models are, the more revenue you're going to make. And timing matters a lot here because a model trained in 2025 can become obsolete by 2027. So if you have a two-year delay in getting your data center online because of the power grid, it becomes a dealbreaker. It has to happen now, coupled with the scale of these data centers. And so, as we talked about, a typical data center started as 5 to 10 megawatts. Then, just a few years ago, we were in the 50 to 100 megawatts. And now this year we're starting to see gigawatt-scale announcements. Now, to be clear, these are campuses that make up a gigawatt. There are multiple facilities, but they are still being built out cohesively and will put a strain on the grid and the local community at a gigawatt scale. Now, to put a gigawatt in perspective. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:02:00): This is the scale of a city's power consumption, right? Maybe a Pittsburgh or Cleveland. And Google's data center electricity use doubled over four years and was up to 30 million megawatt-hours in 2024 from 14 and a half million megawatt-hours in 2020. To put that all into perspective, that's about 3 million U.S. homes, or around three-quarters of a percent of all U.S. electricity consumption. Anay Shah (03:02:22): Which checks out, right? If data centers are currently about 4% of U.S. electricity use, I guess it makes sense that Google's about a fifth of that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:02:31): And it's worth pausing there for a second to talk about that 4% electricity use. When I hear that number, it actually seems shockingly small. For all of the discussion of data centers and electricity, it's like, okay, it's 4%. Let's say it goes to 8%. Compared to industry, compared to cooling and heating buildings. It all feels small. So why might this be such an issue of conflict? Anay Shah (03:02:54): It's a great question. It might have to do with the fact that it's misleading to think about it in terms of total national electricity use, because a data center has a localized and concentrated impact, right? You're not spreading this load across multiple utilities. And not only is it localized and concentrated, it's localized and concentrated in similar areas. Because, as we've been talking about, the network effect of the value of a data center being positioned near the undersea cables and near other network points is where you get a lot of performance gains. And so you end up concentrating yourself in Virginia, in California, in Texas. There's just basically 10 states where you're seeing new data centers come online. And so there's a tremendous impact at a local level—at the electricity prices for that community, that county, and in that state—but not necessarily at a national level. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:03:52): We talk gigawatt scale. That is all about these large training clusters. When we're talking about inference—which is, hey, ChatGPT, processing your response—you actually probably want that spread out, right? You want that closer to the edge, and that's where you need it close to the interconnect, because you want it to not have latency when interacting with the user and their data. Anay Shah (03:04:10): So let's talk a little bit about why you need a gigawatt data center or a 5-gigawatt data center to do the best training possible. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:04:17): You don't really want to think about it as one GPU or a rack of GPUs or a building of GPUs. You want, as much as possible, the whole data center to act together. Because the way that a transformer actually trains is that it makes guesses about what should come next, and then it compares that to reality, and then it tunes the weights across it. And you're doing that collectively across the whole model. And to do that, you need all of the computers working on the problem to be able to communicate quickly. Otherwise, the whole thing is training slowly. The faster those exchanges can happen, the better. And so you want the connectivity between chips to be as fast as possible. You want the connectivity between boxes of chips to be as fast as possible. And so it does not work if all of a sudden half of your computers are on the East Coast and half are on the West Coast, because the speed of light across the country is going to slow you down by multiple orders of magnitude than within one campus, within one center. And that's why Meta wants to build a 5-gigawatt campus because that's going to get them the biggest training model possible. Anay Shah (03:05:21): There's also an interesting nuance here where training models hit higher load factors than an inference model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:05:30): And in a typical data center, you're trying to run this all at once and you're utilizing ideally all your expensive chips. And so all of that leads to a higher utilization and more power and more compute. Anay Shah (03:05:43): So we talked about the speed. More time to power is time to revenue. We've talked about the scale, now going from 100 megawatts to gigawatts. So this creates an objective function when we're thinking about the power constraint on data center growth. And that ends up being: how do we secure large 24/7 power where you need it, when you need it, quickly and ideally as clean as possible? Should be easy, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:06:13): Oh, wait. Not to mention there are supply chain bottlenecks in transformers, bottlenecks in gas turbines, and bottlenecks— Anay Shah (03:06:20): In labor and in specialty skills. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:06:22): We don't have the most up-to-date, freshest grid with transmission lines. So this gets into a very tense moment and an area that arguably breeds innovation. Anay Shah (03:06:33): So the reality is, getting affordable power that is 24/7, quickly and cleanly, is going to be very rare. That Goldilocks situation doesn't really exist today. And so we're going to have to compromise on at least one of those variables. Now you've got a few different options to get these data centers online, right? You can either hook it up to the grid and use power that already exists. You can build new generation of power that's off the grid and power that data center, do some sort of hybrid in between, and over the long term, we can build out large new generation like nuclear, geothermal, and others. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:07:14): Watching this closely, there are both a lot of moments of concern, right, because we're at times doing things like keeping a coal plant running longer than we might have otherwise. But there are also a lot of interesting moments of innovation. A lot of growth in storage to help supplement what's going on and smooth out power generation, and co-locating these in new hybrid ways. Anay Shah (03:07:34): And there's a tension that's largely dictated by timing, right? There's a near-term pain that local communities are facing when you bring a data center online and potentially increase electricity prices. But there's also cause for optimism because you've got well-funded companies who have an interest in long-term sustainable power. And the fact of the matter is, the most affordable, long-term sustainable power we have is going to be clean and renewable. And so this moment actually offers an opportunity for us to accelerate a lot of new clean build on the grid and reshape our electricity infrastructure. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:08:10): I think, at the end of the day, there's also a big issue of incentives. These hyperscalers, they want to build these models. Now, many of them are used to mostly still building their businesses on software-based timescales. And the reality is, despite all the discussion of the utilities and electricity, for them, it's a bottleneck. The actual cost of energy for them to build the biggest models is like 2 to 6%. It is all in the people and the hardware. It is all in the chips and the humans. And so for them, it's all, as you said earlier, this speed to getting out there. And that's not how our system is set up. That's not how our incentive structures are set up, right? Anay Shah (03:08:51): That's right, because the utility supplying that power operates on an entirely different paradigm. In a typical electric utility, power delivered in 2027 is valued at the same amount as power delivered in 2030. Utilities don't differentiate those products, but for the customer—a Google or Meta—there's a massive difference for their business. They need power today. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:09:17): How much more would they pay if they could get power now versus three years from now? Anay Shah (03:09:21): And how much could we unlock in terms of investment into our utilities if they could take advantage of the fact that companies are willing to pay a lot more today than in two years? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:09:31): Brian Janis calls this the Watt-bit spread. It's the economic arbitrage between an available Watt and the ability to turn that into a bit. Reality is, the speed of regulatory change in utility tariff pricing—which is a fancy way of saying how quickly the utility can change anything about their economics—is slow. And so despite there being an obvious market demand structure, it's not going to change in the next 12 months the way that utilities price their product. Anay Shah (03:10:03): Utilities are public goods, right? They power our lives and our schools and our hospitals. And so for good reason, they are regulated. But because they are regulated, they take time to change. And moreover, we have a federated system. We have some 3,000 different utilities across the United States. And so making that change across this country, or even in the 10 states where data centers are getting built out, will take a lot of time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:10:27): Power has become the dominant question of: where can you build your data center? Because you can't go do it without that. But it didn't remove the fact that the other questions still remain. For example, you need people to go build a data center; you need a lot of electricians; you need all the components and the supply chain and the things to build the transformers to step down the power. Anay Shah (03:10:48): Based on how we've been talking about this, you might think that data centers are almost entirely a U.S. story. And while the U.S. is the dominant builder of data centers, there is actually a global story here and global infrastructure being built out, and a strong need for sovereignty for other nations. So in order to help understand what's going on here, let's go back in time a little bit to understand the drama that's setting in globally. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:11:19): I think it's worth looking at just fairly recently. In 2018, Europe passed GDPR, and that set this world baseline for privacy. Thank you. All the cookie pop-ups, but also really tight controls on where EU data sits and what happens if you have EU resident data outside of the EU. And so this is really, I think, a reaction to where people are storing data about our citizens. And so there are controls about what happens if you're holding or transferring data outside of the EU. Anay Shah (03:11:51): In 2018, the U.S. passed the CLOUD Act, which essentially lets U.S. authorities lawfully demand data from U.S. providers, even if that data sits on servers outside of— Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:03): the U.S. And so the net effect is if you're working with EU data at scale, you start to need to have servers and hard drives in the EU. And this becomes, I think, almost another lock-in that the big cloud providers start to have because they go and build the infrastructure to do that. Anay Shah (03:12:19): And we saw this in the Microsoft story, right? A big part of their early scaling was following their enterprise customers globally and needing to build out data centers in Germany as one of the primary cases. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:31): And so if the EU-U.S. looks like a little tiff drama, I think it's time to move to the major geopolitical data center drama, which some have— Anay Shah (03:12:41): deemed the new Cold War. And there's a book called *The Chips War*, which centers around this notion of the U.S. and now China in a fight over everything. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:57): But centered on this technology, right? So, I mean, let's go back to 2012, which I think really kicked off this last decade. Fifteen years of animosity here. The House Intelligence Committee report warned U.S. carriers away from using Huawei and ZTE equipment, saying that we shouldn't use this in any sensitive government system. Now that, of course, starts to spiral outside of just government use. Anay Shah (03:13:21): That was first with the carriers. Beijing responded on a different front: the data front. So in 2017, China's Cybersecurity Law, followed by other laws, pushed data localization and tighter state control. And so the U.S. companies had to respond by localizing operations, which essentially means AWS, Apple, Azure: they either had to sell off to Chinese partners or find a Chinese government-linked company to be a partner. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:13:49): That's right. So it's not just that those companies' hard disks and servers had to be in China, but they actually had to be owned and operated by a Chinese company. And so then the U.S. reacted even further. They barred all federal agencies from buying or using equipment from a long list of covered Chinese vendors. And they barred the FCC from approving any new authorizations from Huawei, ZTE, and others. So this just ramped up further and further. Anay Shah (03:14:14): This brewing war was not just limited to land, but also involves our friends, the undersea cables. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:14:21): Right. Anay Shah (03:14:21): And so in 2016, Google and Facebook partnered with a Hong Kong-based company to build the Pacific Light Cable Network, a massive 12,000-kilometer undersea cable linking Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Part of that global network of undersea cables we were talking about earlier. Seems like a great idea. What could go wrong? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:14:44): And fast forward four years later, to 2020. U.S. national security officials say, "We don't know about this Hong Kong landing point anymore." We think that's going to be a vehicle for Beijing to have surveillance across this important backbone of the internet. And so the FCC ultimately blocked that route. And so now the cable hits Taiwan and the Philippines, and those are lit up. But the Hong Kong branch that's been laid, I believe, is just lying dark. Anay Shah (03:15:10): So I'm sitting here in Los Angeles without that cable to Hong Kong. Now, moving back to land and to chips. The battle continues. And so in 2022, the Commerce Department rolls out these sweeping controls on advanced AI chips and fab tools. And so, remember, this is the moment where we've gone through a COVID boom. We're seeing an uptake in usage from crypto and streaming. And now AI, and the Commerce Department tightens these controls again in 2023 and again in 2024. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:15:43): And this feels very active, right? I mean, literally every quarter of Nvidia's earnings, there are discussions of this. A few weeks ago, the U.S. opened a channel that said Nvidia could ship certain chips that are dialed back, like the H20. But they have to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of the revenue. It's a pretty unprecedented pay-to-export arrangement, like a lot of things that are unprecedented that are going on. But if you zoom out, it raises some good geopolitical strategic questions on how we want to engage, right? Anay Shah (03:16:11): Yeah. It's foundational to the new economy that's being built on this advanced compute power. And it remains to be seen how this plays out. It may backfire. Right. China is not terribly keen on being dependent on U.S. production, so they are infusing massive amounts of capital in their chip sector. It's still a step behind Nvidia in terms of raw performance and software ecosystem dominance. But given China's resources, you have to assume that that gap is going to narrow and narrow quickly. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:16:46): There's a reason China wanted domestic energy. They want to have their own domestic production of silicon here, and so they've invested heavily and they're catching up. Some estimates are that they're 60 to 70% of Nvidia performance; it depends on what they're doing. But they're investing out of a $50 billion fund to improve chip development. Even more so, they're passing policy that says data centers need to source at least 50% of their chips domestically. So they're making sure to really stand up not just the supply side of the market, but also simultaneously the demand side of the market. Anay Shah (03:17:17): The story is less about whether Chinese chips can equal Nvidia's top-end designs and more about how quickly that's going to happen given the demand and the capital that they're putting in. So in short, at the moment, the US is still ahead, but the China chip ecosystem is accelerating rapidly. Their backlog of demand for Nvidia chips, which is being withheld, is going to matter less and less over time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:17:43): The other dynamic that you have geopolitically is governments are seeing the AI data center boom as an important future part of their economy. A deal that exemplifies this is the Emirates deal with OpenAI around this UAE Stargate buildout, a one-gigawatt AI cluster in Abu Dhabi, and all the ecosystem players from Oracle to Nvidia to Cisco to SoftBank coming in to finance this and collaborating on the buildout. I think it just raises a lot of interesting questions: What about the location of a data center matters to a government? Anay Shah (03:18:16): And the map is stark. If you look at where AI data centers are located today, only 32 nations have them, and most of them are in the Northern Hemisphere. You have large swaths of Latin America and Africa as fully dark. Governments are deeply, deeply concerned because they are wondering that if you continue to rent compute power from faraway data centers, you remain at the whims and you remain vulnerable to foreign entities and foreign companies, and you aren't able to support domestic enterprise or domestic scientific research or academia with the same level of control. So this idea of compute sovereignty is top of mind for a lot of people, and a lot of emerging markets are worried that the AI era runs the risk of leaving them even further behind economically. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:19:09): There's almost a rough analogy to energy independence, right? Do you have it regardless of your relationship with another country? That feels like the important thread here. Anay Shah (03:19:18): The other tricky dimension here, which if you talk a little bit about, is the actual impact on the climate, which gets a lot of attention these days, rightly so. There are a few questions that continue to come up, and one that Ben, maybe your mom has asked you, I know mine has, is if a ChatGPT query is bad for the climate. If I care about the climate, should I really be using AI? And we have some data on that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:19:44): There's been some reporting on this, and I think it's an area that's become a pretty hot-button issue for folks. There's been, I think, some people even shaming others for using these tools because of the climate impact. So it's worth looking at the latest numbers. Google actually just put out a publicly readable paper on Gemini where they go down to the details on the energy consumption and the carbon intensity of that energy. The median Gemini text prompt, which for all intents and purposes I think could be viewed as fairly equivalent to a Claude or a ChatGPT or a Copilot prompt, uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy and emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent and consumes 0.26 milliliters or about five drops of water. Those are figures that are substantially lower than what the public estimates have been. For some kind of sense of scale, that per-prompt energy impact is about the same as watching your TV for less than nine seconds. Why do we think the public reporting might be so far off? Anay Shah (03:20:40): There have been a lot of improvements over time, and so it's important to kind of ground ourselves in this moment. We know, through that same report, that the AI systems that we're using are becoming more efficient. There's constant innovation in the software and the hardware to drive more efficiency. So over 12 months, the energy of a standard Gemini text prompt dropped by 33-fold. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:21:04): Wow. Anay Shah (03:21:05): A 33x improvement in the energy consumption. Even more so, from a total carbon footprint per se, we have 44x, all while delivering higher quality responses. So we are moving in a world where the efficiency gains are continuing, and this question of "is your query bad for the climate?" is fairly insignificant. Hannah Ritchie from Our World in Data has independently corroborated this fact. It's an interesting cocktail conversation, but largely misses the forest from the trees. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:21:37): I think the pressure is good positive pressure because one individual query you should not feel bad about. But the pressure for all of these companies to monitor this and drive these numbers down and get these efficiency improvements is a fantastic thing. That's right. And to drive the deployment of clean energy so that the carbon intensity of the energy drives down is a good flywheel to keep pressure on. Anay Shah (03:21:56): Indeed. So, Mom, keep asking a question because Google will then continue to improve. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:22:00): I think there's another area that's been under-discussed. Anay Shah (03:22:03): You don't hear a lot of discussion on the actual carbon intensity of building these very large pieces of infrastructure, pieces of real estate. That's called embodied carbon. So what is the embodied carbon impact of the steel, the cement, the energy used to build a shell and stand up the facility in and of itself? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:22:27): Thankfully, Google did another report on this and shared that in their analysis. Running an AI data center, the operational emissions, which really means the energy going into running the data center ongoing, is going to be about 70 to 90% of the total emissions. Manufacturing emissions, which is really the manufacturer of the server components, the memory, the flash storage, the GPUs, is going to be around 25%. And then the data center construction, so this is the steel and cement and the logistics around that, are around 5%. So this is all to say, I think when you look at this, we should probably be paying a bit more attention to the manufacturing of the components and make sure that we're looking at the LCAs for solid-state disk drives and GPUs and making sure we're taking that into account. But the attention's probably correctly centered on the electricity. Anay Shah (03:23:14): And on this point of focusing in on the manufacturing, the procurement muscle of one of these companies that are building this out is actually a very big leverage. So when Microsoft requires its suppliers to use 100% carbon-free energy by 2030, it will pull their suppliers, all the fab building and the motherboard building and the assemblers. It's moving everyone down the supply chain — it's called Scope 3 emissions — into a cleaner world, which has tremendous power. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:23:43): I think the other thing that's interesting is some of the circularity conversations are starting to happen. So I was at a talk where the Microsoft CSO was talking about how they recently launched, I think it was just in April of this year, a circularity program where they would take the rare earth material in the hard disk drives that they're using in the data centers, and they have a new way to recycle those while disposing of the data. That yields a 90% recovery of those rare earth materials, which also helps stand up a US supply chain around rare earth materials, which we don't really have today, which is pretty phenomenal. Anay Shah (03:24:13): Yeah. Tremendous. And it's going to be a growing discussion over the coming years as we mine for more and more of these critical minerals and the geopolitical control over who has those minerals. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:24:25): All right, so given all of that operational load, is the main contributor to greenhouse gases something like 70% or more of the emissions? How should we think about the scale of that from a meta-climate perspective? Anay Shah (03:24:38): So when we talk about operations, remember we're talking about the energy consumption and not the materials that go into building the data center. Recent studies show that data centers account for about 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. And with more than half of that electricity derived from fossil fuels, that means that data centers generate more than 105 million tons of CO2 every year. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:25:04): Until reading the study, I didn't realize that data centers' carbon intensity is actually higher than average, exceeding the U.S. average by 48%. Anay Shah (03:25:12): The big point here is how grid-dependent that impact is. If these data centers are located on a dirtier grid, let's say a coal-heavy grid in the Mid-Atlantic region of Virginia, then it's going to have a very different climate profile than a data center that's in Eastern Washington that's entirely powered by hydro. So when we talk about 105 million tons of CO2, how should we think about that? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:25:36): A few comparisons to help think about the scale of 105 million tons of CO2 emissions. One is you look at US aviation emissions: this is about half of that. Another would be looking at enteric methane, which is a fancy way of saying cow burps, is around 178 million tons. So that means data centers are about 60% of the equivalent of that. Or all US passenger vehicles are 1,000 million tons, or a gigaton. And so data centers are about 10% of that today. Now, if you look globally, this goes up by approximately a factor of three, as do the rest of these things. So overall, data centers are not insignificant. They're worth tracking on the map here, but quite fractional compared to passenger vehicles, big emitters like livestock, and a third to a half of something like global aviation. The interesting thing, I think, what makes this a hot topic, is not just the current scale, but the projections, right? If all of a sudden we double on our current grid in the US, then now we're caught up to the emissions of aviation in the U.S. And if you keep going from that and you keep the trend line up, you could imagine data centers becoming a fairly dominant story in emissions. Anay Shah (03:26:50): The other leg of the stool in this conversation is how it's affecting the local communities that these data centers are being placed in. One of the themes that we've found come out through this is the impact of these data centers are concentrated and they are disproportionately felt by the environment, the ecology, and the people that immediately surround it. We metaphorically went to Memphis, where XAI is building a very large data center on the banks of the Mississippi, 15 minutes from downtown. And there, Elon is commissioning a 200,000 GPU unit data center. There's been a significant backlash from the Memphis community for good reason. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:27:37): I think a lot of it centers on how are we going to provide power to that? Because the utility said that they can provide XAI power for about 50 megawatts of load, but XAI wants triple that amount. That's a lot of GPUs, and 50 megawatts isn't going to cut it. So they brought in gas turbines — 35 turbines — which could theoretically power 420 megawatts. The problem with that — I mean, it's good they're solving their power problem — but the other problem with that is these are highly polluting gas turbines. So they have the potential to emit a couple thousand tons of smog-forming nitrous oxides each year. For context, that's more than the smog caused by the Memphis airport. So it's like you're adding another airport of smog to the region. Anay Shah (03:28:18): And this impact is not continuous, right, because these data centers ebb and flow in terms of how much power they are consuming. So it's important to look at these peak moments. We found public satellite data from NASA and the European Space Agency that shows that, on average, nitrogen dioxide concentration increased by 3% when comparing for a year before in this area. But in the times of peak consumption, we're talking about a 79% increase in nitrogen dioxide concentration from pre-XAI levels in that area. So you can imagine it's like sitting in a traffic jam, and those moments have outsized impact on the community at that moment in time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:00): Yeah. And so there's been a lot of pushback from this pollution and health risk standpoint. It's hitting South Memphis neighborhoods that already have elevated asthma and cancer rates from past industrial waste. This temporary electricity generation infrastructure isn't going to sustain in the long term. So all of this is kind of a case study in both the local impacts and also the time-to-power issue. Anay Shah (03:29:24): And this notion of time to power, essentially what it means is there is enough demand to get these data centers online quickly. The companies are willing to pay more and more. So when you have that kind of economic pressure, the community resistance sometimes can only go so far. As we're seeing in this case, XAI, despite the pressures, is currently building out a second location a few miles away, which will be double the size. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:50): Of the first: half a million of these GPUs. Anay Shah (03:29:53): I mean, just insane. That's the current moment we're living in. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:59): So far we've been trying to keep it focused on what has been built more than what is proposed. But I think it's worth taking an extreme view on some of what's coming. Meta has announced their big long-term project, their big training center, the Hyperion project, located in Richland Parish, Louisiana. It's a $10 billion buildout, online by 2030. They'll have a few steps in between. The goal is for this to be a five-gigawatt canvas covering over 2,000 acres. Anay Shah (03:30:28): What is 2,000 acres? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:30:29): Yeah. So a different way to visualize this is this data center is about the size of Lower Manhattan. It is at a scale that is kind of unfathomable, right? That we're going to build buildings of that scale in a few years here to power such a new technology. Anay Shah (03:30:48): That Louisiana project is a great example of what we are living, the step-change function that we are living through right now. This is the biggest tech infrastructure project since either the 1960s, the dawn of the computer age, or even the 1880s, the heyday of the railroad period. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:31:09): I think Nvidia is on pace to capture the highest share of market-wide capital spending since IBM peaked in their percentage of that in 1969. And so a lot of comparisons are being made to other past booms like the Gilded Age or the telco buildout. Anay Shah (03:31:25): And when you mentioned booms, obviously you end up thinking about busts, right? So we talked about the telecom boom of the 1990s, which contributed to the dot-com crash and a bust on fiber. You also look back at the 1870s and the huge railroad boom that led to a crash, and both of these pose the question of, like, did we overbuild? Are we outrunning our demand? In both of those cases, it's not that the CapEx spenders were wrong; they were just early. We saw this vividly in the fiber overbuild. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:32:00): Right. Anay Shah (03:32:01): By the year 2000, we were only using 3% of the fiber we had laid. But it was absolutely necessary to power the next couple decades. And that's what it looks like for AI is that there may be an overbuild in this moment, but the foundational nature of this technology suggests that it's going to get utilized. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:32:20): Yeah, I think there's such a rush here because the potential AI market creates this economic imperative to go and plug in as many GPUs as quickly as possible, and that will build the largest and smartest AI model, which will create a moat. I think there's an interesting question here, though, of what is the infrastructure? Because yes, we still use the railroad tracks and we still use the fiber, but remember that all the companies that were building the fiber and the ones that were on top of that, it was too early for them to capture that value. But what's in part different about this boom is how it's being funded now. Yes, there are VC dollars and other dollars going into it, but at least historically, and if you look at the major capital expense, it is these big companies we've spent the episode talking about — it is Amazon, Microsoft, Google buying from Nvidia. And they're using the fact that their business models have thrown off billions and billions of dollars every quarter to then go buy the chips and build this out. So there's a real kind of concentration in some of the buildout of the infrastructure. Anay Shah (03:33:20): Those previous boom-busts financed by the banks end up drawing in the rest of the economy. And while there are some private credit actors and venture capitalist actors, because it's largely financed by free cash flow of these private companies, a bust hurts them, which will drag down the stock market, but is hopefully insulating the rest of the capital providers that are not involved. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:33:43): There is supposedly now more private credit starting to come in to fund this, and that could create linkages to other parts of the system. We will see how that plays out. We've talked about the story of data centers up until present day. Let's zoom out for a second and talk about just where we are today from a sense of scale. Anay Shah (03:34:04): Let's start with the most basic question: How many data centers exist today? There are globally approximately 11,800 data centers worldwide. Now, of course, the counting of this gets nuanced when you think about the closets that still exist with servers as they did back in the day. But by and large, we're talking about independent construction. And the US is by far the largest with over 5,000 data centers, followed by Germany, the UK, China, and Canada. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:34:33): So the US has almost half the data centers. Wow. Anay Shah (03:34:36): Yeah, heavy concentration in the U.S. Obviously other countries are catching up. China is building very quickly. So this begs the question of who owns all of these 11,000 data centers and who's spending these hundreds of billions of dollars. And you can kind of think of it in four broad categories. That's representative of the US but also it fits globally. And so the first category are our friends, the colocation centers, the ones we've talked about: Equinix, Digital Realty, and others. There are about a dozen of these that are building 10 to 100 megawatt blocks in the US and around the world. The second category are the hyperscalers: the Facebooks, Amazons, Microsofts; you can add in Apple, Oracle in there. They account for almost half of global data center capacity, and they're the lion's share of new growth. But importantly, you still have thousands of private server rooms in banks and retail facilities and public institutions that are out there. So while large in count, they're relatively smaller in capacity, but today still make up about 35%. And finally, you've got legacy telcos that are still owning and operating data centers. Now the interesting thing about this is the trend, right? You're seeing enterprise and public sector data centers trending down, and new build increasingly going to hyperscalers and these purpose-built colocation facilities. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:35:54): So how much actual physical real estate space are all of these data centers taking up? This is like anything that gets into this level of detail. It can be hard to pull exact numbers, but one reasonable estimate is that maybe there's one and a half billion square feet globally in data center buildout. For context, if you took an average median US home of around 2,200 square feet, that's around 730,000 of those homes of square footage, or 28,000 football fields. Anay Shah (03:36:20): Importantly, including end zones. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:36:24): That feels like a big number. But for some comparison to some other infrastructure in our life: If you just took the U.S. interstate system, so this is, you know, I-5, I-90, the big interstates, just the asphalt of those interstates is 10 times the square footage. So let's talk about power. Anay Shah (03:36:40): Remember the impact of data centers on power: it's quite localized and concentrated to its physical location. But let's talk about it in a sense of scale. We mentioned that in the US it's about 4.5% of total electricity. That's roughly 17 million households' annual use. How can I conceive of that power? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:36:59): Yeah, I think if you look at the electricity consumption of the city of New York, it's about three New Yorks to power all the data centers in the US. Or if you look at all data centers globally, it's about equivalent to the power consumption of the United Kingdom. If you look at other comparable industries, it's pretty close to the power consumption of the chemical industry or the primary metals industry. This is extracting iron ore and smelting aluminum. Anay Shah (03:37:26): Similarly, on the water question, there's a tremendous amount of nuance in how to aggregate total water consumption. But let's just do the average of the average. Let's take direct water for cooling, indirect water from the power generated for the plant, and get a sense of how much water this is using US data. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:37:45): Centers together consume about 250 million gallons of water per day. That's about a quarter of what the city of New York uses. Anay Shah (03:37:53): So we've talked about the space, the data centers, how many of them, who owns them, how is it being powered and cooled? What's actually inside of them? Let's think about the scale of the compute power. It's actually a little bit difficult to figure out what humanity's overall compute power is, but let's just say there are about 50 to 100 million servers globally. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:38:13): Yeah. And so, I think the best way to get at this was to go back to the electricity usage numbers and then look at how much compute power we get per unit of electricity. What's surprising here is that if you run the numbers, we've grown humanity's compute power around 40x over the last decade, but have only grown power consumption about two and a half times because we've gotten more efficient. And if you look at that new compute power that's come online, only around 10% of data centers are AI-focused today. Of course, that's a growing percentage. Anay Shah (03:38:45): So compute power is one part of what the data center is doing. Let's give a sense of the scale on storage. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:38:51): Yeah. So in the last decade, we've 3x to 4x total installed storage capacity to around 15 zettabytes. Anay Shah (03:38:57): And so we're speaking to a friend of the show, Byron, who made me understand the modern marvel of hard drives. So imagine the head of the hard drive is scaled up to the size of a Boeing 747. It's flying at 560 miles an hour, and it is about the thickness of one piece of paper above a football field. That hard drive head is reading and writing to every single blade of grass moving at 560 miles an hour. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:39:27): That is absolutely insane. And so we have all these hard drives and all this compute. Now they're connected via these submarine cables. How many of those do we have? Anay Shah (03:39:34): We have approximately 600 active submarine cables that are powering 99% of international usage on the internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:39:45): So in total, we're about 100 times the global bandwidth that we were a decade ago. And we've seen internet bandwidth continue to grow 25% year over year. Anay Shah (03:39:53): And so these numbers are today's snapshot. Now, there are a lot of projections out there of where growth is going to go over the next five years. It can get fairly outlandish, but suffice to say, growth is continuing to accelerate now and in the years to come. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:40:10): All right, well, we talked about Byron's plane reading and writing blades of grass. Now it's time to land our plane. Anay, let's do the themes. What did you realize bubbled up for you over the course of this research and conversation? Anay Shah (03:40:24): It's been a journey. I did not know a lot coming in and have learned way more about the ins and outs of data centers than I ever imagined. A few big things will continue to stick with me. One of the first books we read is called *Tubes*, and it's this nonfiction, nerdy detective story to discover where this thing called the internet lives. It turns out the cloud is quite physical, but even more interesting, it's strangely concentrated. The internet has almost infinite edges, but it's got a shockingly small number of centers and has been built in this hub-and-spoke structure. And so for me, that starts with May East, right? Ashburn, Virginia, home to 13% of global data capacity and has once carried north of 30% of the world's internet traffic. That is the undisputed capital of the internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:41:25): And it's so wild that that became the hub just by being the hub. There's just this center of gravity that spiraled on itself, a black hole of data center investment, almost by accident, right? Yeah. Anay Shah (03:41:38): The internet's structure is based on this mesh connectivity of global cities on coastal shores. It's Virginia, New York, D.C., London, Paris, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Seoul, Lagos, all connected by these 600 undersea cables that are literally powering the world's economy. And so I think about data centers that started off occupying closets, growing to whole floors, then buildings, then warehouses. And I start to think of the cloud as a building, as a factory, where a bit comes in, gets massaged, gets put together in the right way, and then it gets sent out to its destination, and it really brings the internet home. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:42:21): For me, this connects to one of my reflections, which is threaded through the invisibility of this infrastructure and what makes data centers and the connecting internet almost the perfect abstracted infrastructure. And what I mean by that is you can access them, you can use them, you can get all of the power of them without ever seeing them or touching them. Now, with us living in a mostly wirelessly blanketed internet ourselves, you have access to all of these warehouses and all these buildings via all these undersea cables. And if you're an engineer developing software, you can deploy to all these regions around the world and never actually look at a CPU or a hard drive in your life. It is, I think, the best-abstracted physical infrastructure that humanity has built. It is physical, it is silicon, it is electricity, it is fiber. There is no real magic. It is all physics. But the only infrastructure I can think of in humanity that is as well abstracted is maybe money, but money is actually not physical anymore. In the same way, this actually is still doing physical work. And that struck me. Anay Shah (03:43:34): It does. It feels very rare to have global infrastructure that is defining our life and how the world operates, to be so. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:43:44): Invisible, and so frequently in our life. Even though it is invisible, our entire day is mediated by this infrastructure. But if your entire day is spent on the train, you're very aware of where the tracks are, and you can see them, and you're on the train. That's the engine, right? Anay Shah (03:44:01): Even fire, we probably used it selectively throughout the day. The railroads, we got on and off. The car, we got in and out of. Electricity, we turned the lights on and off. This is a modern marvel that we're only not using when we sleep. And even then, it's doing stuff for us. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:20): It's tracking my sleep. I'm wearing a ring that's tracking my sleep, sending bits to Oura's servers. Yeah, as you were saying that, it's like you're getting on and off a train. You're kind of turning electricity on and off in a transactional moment. This is almost more like you're living in it, right? You're living in this infrastructure, but we never see it. Anay Shah (03:44:44): I just had a flash of *Ready Player One*. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:46): Yes. Anay Shah (03:44:47): Putting on the full suit and immersing myself in another reality. We're close, when you think about it this way. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:54): I think that's right. I think this gets to one of my other realizations when comparing this to other physical infrastructure, which is, despite it being truly physical—buildings and silicon and electricity—we are upgrading it continuously and rapidly. Part of that is because of Moore's Law. Part of that is because of the improvement of the hardware and our techniques for cooling and all of these things. But I feel that with most other infrastructure, you get to, "Okay, this is a reasonably good way to build a train track. Now we need to go build more of it," or, "This is a reasonably good way to transport electricity. So now we're going to build more transmission." And certainly you get a little bit better at transmission, but we don't just get a little bit better here. We're getting 40x better. In the last decade, which was off the previous decade, it's gotten much better. So it's this weird thing where, yes, it's infrastructure, but it is changing what it is. We're getting at such an order of magnitude scale so quickly. And I can't think of other analogies to that. Maybe the first 20, 30 years of electricity felt like this, but this feels... something feels even more drastic here because what is being delivered is not commoditized exactly the same way as electricity. Anay Shah (03:46:02): That sense of movement that you're describing reminds me of another one of my takeaways, which is where I'm feeling stuck. And that's on the question of power. To me, it's easy to think about the complexities of why the power problem is so hard to solve, and yet the answers are right in front of us. The problem is huge, right? Data centers are pulling more and more electricity from the grid. The problem is hard because the grid is strained, the turbines and transformers are backlogged, and we don't really have utilities that are built to capture the incentive structures to value what hyperscalers are willing to pay today. And it's going to take years to reform the grid to actually meet the needs. And at the same time, the fastest, cheapest energy is available today. It's solar, storage, putting renewable energy online quickly and cheaply. That is already accounting for 90% of new capacity going on the grid. Despite every effort from our current administration to execute an ideological war on clean power and claim that we're in some national energy emergency, and yet deny the grid affordable electrons being placed on it. So if we can just get out of our own way, we can put a lot of power on the grid fairly quickly. The other side of that story is the way we're building data centers: accounting for 24/7 peak load. And there's a famous study that circulated earlier this year from Duke University that suggested that if we can limit grid-facing power of data centers by just 1% a year—90 hours out of the entire year—we can unlock 100 gigawatts of load. We can unlock the equivalent of two nuclear fleets on the US energy grid. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:47:54): Right. You saw Google do some recent announcements where they're collaborating with some of the utility providers to do exactly that. There are new startups that we see all the time that are building businesses around that concept. This connects really closely to my major takeaway on the power story, which is that limitations drive innovation, especially when they come up against a legacy incumbent system—something that generally works, and reasonably well. Which for all of our general disgruntledness about utilities in our life, it is phenomenal that the electricity works most of the time as well as it does. And it has not gotten a kick in the behind in a long time in terms of needing to try and evolve. There have been decades of people talking about a smarter grid, but nothing's forced the need like the AI data center competition and the geopolitical competition with China, which drives innovation across the stack. It's exactly what you're saying in terms of driving the next cheap, clean electron on the grid in the forms of renewable energy. But it's also pushing us on transmission and permitting, and it's also pushing us inside the data center to think even further about AI models. And we've invested in companies that improve the efficiency of actually running and training the model. Anay Shah (03:49:12): That's right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:49:12): And so up and down this whole stack, a point we found again from talking to people and from research, these types of crunches drive efficiency innovation and the evolution of the grid. Anay Shah (03:49:24): And arguably, according to folks who have been in this for decades, we've been fairly lazy on innovation. It's been a lot of low-hanging fruit. And so this type of forcing function can drive step-change improvements in something as complicated as our national grid. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:49:41): So to me, all of that points to long-term optimism: first, in solving the problems, but second, in solving them in a way that leads to more clean energy deployment. However, it also means needing to recognize and not dismiss the near-term local impacts for both power and water in these environments. Anay Shah (03:50:01): I love that point because as we talked through these stories, that theme kept recurring of how it is different when you think about the problem locally than when you think about the problem nationally. And I think that's really important for people to understand as this is more and more headline news. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:50:16): My personal takeaway is less and less anxiety about that next incremental Gemini Query, ChatGPT, Anthropic use case or storing a video, and a greater desire to have more awareness locally within a given county that's struggling with air quality or water shortages. Because that's where activism needs to center within communities in the moment, rather than trying to slow the valuable uses and progress that we're all building toward. Anay Shah (03:50:45): Absolutely. This point on communities and geography and where things are located brings up another takeaway that's close to my heart as a former international politics major and someone who spent 20 years living and working across emerging markets. And that's the geopolitical implications of the moment we're living through right now. And so we talked a little bit about this, but to me, it really crystallizes into a twofold idea: One is the notion that we're living through this chip war, right? That microchips have replaced oil as one of the world's most critical resources and it's a key determinant of economic and military power. And we're in a new Cold War. This time, it's largely with China. As Americans, we don't want a country like China accessing our data or having superior performance over us. And so we're actively preventing US companies from selling chips to China. But it's not so straightforward, right? Because you think of, "Okay, Nvidia as an American company, we can prevent that." But Nvidia is the architect of the chips, right? The manufacturer of over 90% of the world's advanced chips is a Taiwanese company, TSMC, and they're the ones actually constructing it. So this geopolitical tension has various layers to it, but the notion that we're living through a new Cold War and the chip is the center of that story is quite striking. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:52:07): I think in the long term, or mid to long term, this type of technology is a genie that can't be put back into the bottle. China, in particular, is hyper-aware of what they want to domestically build for themselves here and actually is in a great position from a supply chain perspective to pull that off. Even if they're a couple years behind. You've seen them spin up AI labs, spin up their own domestic chip manufacturing, and do impressive jobs. And you can say, "Well, 18 months ahead," but what is that in the scale of this foundational technology? Anay Shah (03:52:40): Yeah, 18 months is a blink of an eye. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:52:42): I lean again toward long-term optimism that this competition creates good incentives for us to rethink our fundamental constraints, which are mostly on the clean energy deployment side. One big thing China has going for it that we don't have is its ability to grow generation of clean energy much, much faster than we do in the US. Again, because of their solar panel supply chain, their battery supply chain. Anay Shah (03:53:07): Their government structure, their ability to build, is unmatched. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:53:11): And so this is giving a lot of our structures a kick to rethink what's slowing us down. If this is so existentially important to stay at least on par, if not ahead on. Anay Shah (03:53:22): I agree strongly. In this notion of the chip war, I think it's interesting. In this moment, I think over the medium to long term, it's less. So here's where I don't share as much optimism: the AI boom and data center build-out that's potentially creating a new digital divide, exacerbating global inequality on yet another dimension. So we've talked about how US hyperscalers run almost 50% of data center compute. The U.S., China, and the European Union host more than half of all powerful data centers. What does that mean for the billions of other people living around the world? And what is the implication for a country that is renting compute power from a faraway data center? It's potentially higher costs, slower connection speeds, and compliance to different laws. But more importantly, as we unpack this—as we're trying to wrestle with this idea—it's this question of having a critical national security and economic infrastructure input owned, operated, and housed outside of your control. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:54:28): The techno-optimist in me is just screaming to refute this, and I'll tell you why. And I think we can study the internet as an example. This feeds into, I think, another meta theme for us, which is that these companies are the modern-day utilities, but they're actually the opposite in a way of the governing structure of an electricity utility, which is hyper-localized and granted local monopoly. These are global utilities. They're providing much more non-commodity functionality, everything down to a bespoke AI model that they're training, down to more commodity storage. And the business model of a utility is to, as we've seen again and again, provide more as cheaply as possible to as many customers as possible. And you've seen the biggest internet companies grow by incentivizing and subsidizing free services to more and more people. And that has led to a lot of the world getting connected that was not connected just 10 years ago. There's reason to be cynical about what Google and Meta are doing, trying to get more of the world connected. Don't they just want more customers? Obviously, yes, they want more customers. But in doing so, a lot more of the world has access to the internet than ever before, and information and knowledge. And I think that's where I fall on the side of optimism: that there's nothing more that OpenAI wants than more people having access to OpenAI. Now, that to me goes to the individual human level, which is very different than how a nation-state or the government in control of a nation-state might feel about it. But I lean on the individual human in a global context, and what powers I want them and their children to have in the decades to come. And that's where I get a source of optimism. Anay Shah (03:56:07): I mean, it's true. Sixty-six-plus percent of the world's population is now connected to the internet, and that number is increasing. I like the optimism. I wonder if the nature of this technology, particularly AI compute power, functions differently than access to the internet, access to electricity, and access to other similar infrastructures—having that controlled by private equity and public companies that have very specific incentive structures. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:56:39): I think there's a big thing that you just hit on for me, which is my optimism doesn't really account for the hosting government of hyperscalers. And so it's not just that these are companies, but they're American companies. If they're American companies, they exist a little bit at the pleasure of the American government. And that means that another country's access to them exists at the pleasure of the American government. And that, I think, gets to a more complex nuance, and to me, it just drives value to the idea of more global models and more global competition, even if it's not hosted within a given country, so that it's not just one or two governments that have control over these technologies. Anay Shah (03:57:22): More models trained on different languages, of course, and different speech patterns. And so, how this unregulated utility—as we're talking about, this new digital utility, this new critical infrastructure that society will increasingly depend on—will continue to be seen as a public good and delivered to more and more people as that... You know, they say hindsight is 20/20, but there's something even more interesting about creating a historical narrative to something like data centers. And it's the marvel of the narrative process, this story, that starts to make so much sense of how one thing came after another. So you start off with IBM and Watson's journey and the introduction of the punch card that is storing data, and then the machines that start to compute off that storage, and that grows and evolves. And you've got the Cold War introducing the need for connecting networks, and suddenly you've got compute and storage power. Network connections bring that together, and that continues to evolve. And then you get the explosion of the '90s. And in this time, first slightly accidental and then more purposeful infrastructure starts to get built in very important nodes, and the fiber boom happens. I think I'll now always associate the late '90s with the overbuild of fiber and this notion that by the time the dot-com bust happened, we only used 3% of the fiber that we built. It's wild. And yet that was exactly what we needed to go through the run-up of the 2000s and the growth of consumer and enterprise internet, mobile, and streaming, and then eventually the cloud. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:59:10): And then you had crypto creating this market for the AI chips before we had the models. Cycles of building ahead of the curve, there being some bust, but then there being this new utilization of those fundamental building blocks. Anay Shah (03:59:22): Absolutely. And these brilliant people located within very important companies that took the lead to build what is now foundational infrastructure for the world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:59:34): And then there's another dance that's happening—in where storage and compute lives for the average consumer or average business—where you go from it being all on the mainframe. Then it moves eventually to the PC. And you feel so powerful with your PC, but you have no collaboration, no backup, no redundancy. Then it moves back to the server room. Then in the mobile era, your connection is really slow. Early days, you think about the first iPhone: it was a really slow edge connection. So your phone actually had to do most of the stuff on the phone. But now we live in this world where the connection's back, fat, and happy. And so we do everything now on the server except for rendering the UI on the phone. And so this dance—of where both compute and storage happens, mediated by the communication bandwidth—is a really interesting dance that I see played out in the story. Anay Shah (04:00:26): That dance then drove the cloud boom of the 2010s and the maturing of enterprise cloud and infrastructure, where now you're able to do everything you want at higher and higher utilization in the cloud. And all of that build-out, and that fine-tuning and optimization, allowed us to enter March of 2020—the dark days of the beginning of the pandemic—and switch over from in-person to online from the perspective of the internet, largely without much of a hiccup. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:01:04): Yeah, going to slightly lower resolution Netflix videos for a month. I think we handled it pretty well from a technology infrastructure perspective. Anay Shah (04:01:13): Correct. And how that just so happened to juice the infrastructure even more, to lay the foundation for GPUs to finally be utilized for what was growing in the background: machine learning and large language model training. And then November of 2022, putting a chatbot on top of a model, and the AI boom and the infrastructure that was laid to capture that moment, and the cash coffers of the hyperscalers that were ready to meet that moment, are now propelling the greatest technological infrastructure build-out in human history. What a story. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:01:59): Yeah. Do you think it's an overbuild? Anay Shah (04:02:02): There are things that I worry about in this world, as we noted from the geopolitical situation, but once I strap in, the optimist in me takes over. So I am fully convinced that we will utilize every photon, electron, and square footage. I hope that this is the opportunity where we collectively can seize the moment to get more clean, firm power online, more affordable power online, and where we can use technology and renewable power to reduce the depletion of water resources in critical areas. The opportunity to build a newly-skilled workforce to build out this new infrastructure. The opportunity to modernize our aging grid, our transmission lines, the way we do siting and permitting, the way we do environmental review processes, the way utilities are incentivized to meet demand. The opportunity to spur local economic development in communities all over the country, and in the world. The opportunity to have large enterprises build out infrastructure that will be a net benefit to the consumer where they're locating their assets. And I think it's really important for us to be mindful of the cost of moving so quickly and not thinking through the implications of water, power, climate, communities, and global equity. And my real hope is that when you have this much capital and this much demand coming on to reshape a foundational technological infrastructure, we come out the other end with an ability to—as one of our new friends that we interviewed said—build these assets as ecologically invisible as possible. I think we have the opportunity to do that. And when we come out the other end having done that, I think our children's generation will look more kindly on us. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:04:04): I think so, yeah. My big takeaway is that, of all the things we might study on this show, this one feels like the major piece of infrastructure that we're living in the middle of the step change. We are in the sharp part of the curve that's going up. This level of capital investment and build-out is what it looked like if you were to put yourself back into the initial build-out of the electricity grid or the railroad system, but further compressed. What's so interesting about that is you get to experience personally how quickly you adapt to amazing infrastructure and power—how quickly we've adapted, I think, to having the latest large language models at our fingertips. Now I have Claude Code, and I'm a few weeks into using that. I have what feels like new powers, but I'm kind of getting used to it again. We lived through most of this story and have vivid memories. Like, I remember Blockbuster, and I remember when Netflix was a DVD rental service. That was because it was too expensive to move streaming video at that scale, and now it's blindingly cheap. The business model changes; the products completely change. We are living through this cycle of infrastructure iteration and evolution at a pace that's rapidly changing what we can do with it. I don't know when we'll again get to the upper step of that curve, but we are living in the step change, and I'm just trying to relish that experience. Anay Shah (04:05:35): The rocket ship is in takeoff, feeling some G-forces. That's right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:05:39): But you get used to it, don't you? Anay Shah (04:05:41): Very quickly. Shockingly fast. I mean, even since we launched the fund two years ago to now, our workflows have changed dramatically. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:05:53): That's right. Anay Shah (04:05:54): Despite the fact that you and I continue to look at each other 12 hours a day in the same screen. Yeah, yeah. The normalization of humans is astounding. And then you start thinking about our kids and how they're growing up in... Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:06): This moment: speaking to ChatGPT, Santa Claus if they want, or making a game. My four-year-old programmed a game that runs in JavaScript by telling Claude what he wanted. Anay Shah (04:06:18): Amazing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:20): It is wild, wild times. Anay Shah (04:06:22): We are living through a step change moment. Thanks for listening. Hopefully you're that much more informed about the invisible infrastructure that's not so invisible in powering the modern world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:39): You know how you got this podcast into your ears? It's amazing. That's right. Anay Shah (04:06:43): If you enjoyed this and have friends or colleagues that you think may find the story of data centers valuable, please send it their way. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:51): And please make sure you're subscribed to Step Change in your podcast player of choice so you find out when our next episode comes out, which at this current pace will be at least once more this year, I hope. And sign up for emails from us at StepChange Show. Podcast ratings make a huge difference to help people discover this, so we always appreciate them and love hearing from listeners.

Title: Today in Apple history: Apple stock smashes through $700 barrier
URL: https://www.cultofmac.com/apple-history/apple-stock-hits-700-dollars
Time Published: 2025-09-17T14:48:43Z
Full Content:
By Luke Dormehl • 7:48 am, September 17, 2025 September 17, 2012: On the back of record iPhone 5 preorders of 2 million in 24 hours, Apple’s stock price hits a new all-time high. For the first time in history, AAPL breaks the $700 mark in after-hours trading. Passing the milestone cements Cupertino’s place as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Amazingly, the new record is $270 a share higher than at the start of the year. Apple stock rose 65% in just nine months. By any measurable metric, Apple enjoyed soaring success in 2012. A stock price breaking $700 was just the latest in a series of dizzying records the company set in a few short years. In January 2006, Apple surpassed the value of Dell, the company whose founder once said he’d shut down Apple and refund its shareholders. A few years later, Apple overtook Microsoft — besting the tech giant that dominated the 1990s. In August 2011, Apple briefly overtook ExxonMobil to become the world’s most valuable company. And Apple’s stock price just kept climbing from there. At the end of February 2012, Apple surpassed the $500 billion market cap, then smashed through $600 billion in April. By September 2012, Apple was valued at upward of $650 billion. To put that in perspective, Apple was worth more than second-place ExxonMobil plus the entire net worth of Google at the time. Not bad for a company that had fallen to $12.88 a share on September 29, 2000. Apple hasn’t exactly renounced its winning ways since then. It became the first publicly traded U.S. company to pass the $800 billion, $900 billion, $1 trillion, $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion valuations. In early 2022, it surged past the $3 trillion line briefly before dropping amid a wider market pull-back. And it did the same thing in mid-2023. (Phew!) At the time of writing, AAPL is trading at around $240 a share. However, it’s not fair to compare this stock price with Apple’s $700 milestone from 2012, due to a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014 and a subsequent 4-to-1 split in 2020. As the stock prices of some AI-focused companies surged in recent years, Nvidia and Microsoft surpassed Apple’s market valuation. Currently, Apple’s market cap sits at $3.554 trillion, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world, with Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Meta hot on its heels.

Title: Has Elon Musk really been awarded a $1 trillion pay deal?

And why has the South African entrepreneur been busy buying up shares in Tesla? By Alex Kozul-Wright Share Save Tesla shares jumped 6 percent on Monday after CEO Elon Musk disclosed that he had bought $1bn worth of the company’s stock. The move reinforces Musk’s push for greater control over Tesla and comes a week after the company’s board offered him a $1 trillion pay package over the next decade. Musk’s stock purchase – his first open-market buy-up of shares since 2020 – comes at a critical time for Tesla, as it races to transform into an artificial intelligence and robotics firm whilst also grappling with falling sales of electric vehicles (EVs). But Musk’s pay packet has come in for intense criticism. Last weekend, Pope Leo decried the widening pay gap between corporate bosses such as Elon Musk – whose estimated wealth now stands at $367bn – and ordinary working people, which he said was a major factor in growing global unrest. On September 12, Musk, 54, purchased 2.57 million shares (which represents less than one percent of Tesla’s market capitalisation), paying between $372 and $397 per share as the price varied through the day, according to regulatory filings. He now owns almost 20 percent of Tesla, which seemingly pleases its investors. Tesla’s share price rose to around $422 on Monday – still 12 percent lower than its all-time high of $479 (reached in December 2024). Following his recent move, Musk posted on X that the increase in Tesla’s value was “foretold in the prophecy”. While Musk wasn’t an original founder of Tesla – he invested in the company one year after it was established – he became chairman in 2004. The South African entrepreneur has consistently demanded a bigger stake and more voting power at Tesla, having previously said he would prefer to build AI products and robots outside of Tesla if he cannot control 25 percent voting power in the firm. Musk sold more than $20bn of Tesla’s stock (or 4.6 percent of its market cap) in 2022 to fund his acquisition of Twitter, now X, for $44bn. He also owns private holdings in SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. The Tesla CEO will have to meet certain performance-related criteria first. To unlock the full $1 trillion payout, Musk will have to raise the company’s valuation from roughly $1 trillion today to $8.5 trillion over the next 10 years. He will also have to sell one million autonomous taxis and one million robots and increase Tesla’s profits by more than 24 times what it earned last year. Tesla currently operates a few dozen autonomous taxis in a limited area in the city where it is headquartered, Austin, Texas in the US. Known as “robotaxis“, they are self-driving vehicles but are accompanied by human “safety supervisors”, who can intervene if problems occur. On the robotics side, the company unveiled its first humanoid robot – Optimus – in 2022. In 2024, Musk claimed that Tesla would deploy robots for “internal use [ie for use inside its own factories]” in 2025, and that it would have produced 5,000 units by then. Neither pledge has been met so far. Musk also recently said that “80 percent of Tesla’s [future] value will be Optimus”. After Musk joined Tesla in 2004, he took very little cash pay. Instead, he chose to be paid in equity. Then, in 2018, shareholders approved a landmark 10-year pay package for Musk – linked to various operational targets – estimated at $2.6bn. As Tesla’s market value surged after the start of 2020 (when it was trading at just $29.50 a share), many of those pay objectives were met, and Musk received a large number of additional Tesla shares. Due to broad stock market gains since the COVID-19 pandemic, Musk’s earnings are estimated to have climbed by $40bn-$60bn. Though Musk’s pay windfall at Tesla has attracted regulatory scrutiny for overcompensation, especially from Delaware’s Court of Chancery, most of the company’s shareholders have repeatedly ratified the CEO’s payment packages. Tesla doesn’t disclose non-executive salaries, so it is hard to say how Musk’s income compares to that of the average worker there. However, corporate pay in the US has generally rallied in recent decades compared to that of workers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, average pay for CEOs at S&P 500 companies – the 500 biggest listed firms in the US – rose by almost 1,000 percent over the 50-year period leading up to 2024. By contrast, a typical worker at an S&P 500 company has seen his or her pay packet rise by just 27 percent (adjusted for inflation) over the same period. Stated differently, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has increased from 30:1 to 350:1 over the past five decades. In an interview last week with Crux, a Catholic news website, Pope Leo singled out Elon Musk as an example of the kind of wealth he said was corroding “the value of human life, of the family, of the value of society”. Asked about Tesla’s proposed $1 trillion pay packet, Leo responded: “What does that mean, and what’s that about? If [personal wealth accumulation] is the only thing that has any value any more, then we are in big trouble.” Despite its recent uptick, so far this year, Tesla’s stock market performance has been among the worst of the “Magnificent 7” group of tech giants – which also includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia – having lost around 2 percent of its value this year so far. Tesla’s most recent quarterly results showed profit losses amid falling demand for electric vehicles and increased import production costs associated with US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Looking ahead, earnings look set to continue falling. Sales of Tesla cars in the US will likely fall further in the last three months of 2025, as Trump has refused to extend a tax credit for EV purchases for US consumers after October. Up to now, the rebate has played a crucial role in making American EVs more affordable. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Rocket Lab: How Low Can RKLB Stock Really Go?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/17/rocket-lab-how-low-can-rklb-stock-really-go/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) trended lower following the company's announcement to raise $750 million through equity dilution. This move, which increases the total number of shares, often concerns investors because it can negatively impact a company's earnings per share. The key question is the extent of the downside risk for RKLB stock. Despite its recent decline, the stock still appears overvalued. This overvaluation, combined with the stock’s history of only modest rebounds after previous drops, suggests there is considerable risk. Consider the following information: While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals are solid – for RKLB, see Buy or Sell RKLB Stock – we are cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it is crucial to determine if the situation deteriorates significantly, leading to an additional drop of 20-30% to the $33 level, and whether we will be able to retain the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Below is an in-depth analysis of Rocket Lab’s downturn resilience – particularly, its performance in comparison to the market during previous crises. It turns out that the stock experienced an impact that was slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock fell and (b) how swiftly it recovered. Below are the specifics, but before that, as a brief background: RKLB offers launch services, small orbital vehicles, and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government space and defense sectors. Overall, Rocket Lab (RKLB) stock has a history of experiencing significant declines during broader market corrections. While the company has generated investor interest through its successful rocket launches and new contracts—especially for its upcoming Neutron rocket—investors should also be mindful of the potential downside risk. Concerned that RKLB may decline further? You may want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have historically comfortably outperformed its benchmark, which comprises the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a steadier ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Job seekers: Where are you looking for opportunities right now? There’s been plenty of coverage on the plight of those currently looking for a new job. From the falling hiring rates and increasing unemployment time—the average American now spends more than five months in between jobs, up from four in 2024—to the flood of AI-generated résumés that recruiters receive, applicants are having a tough time. Keeping your search to just one job board isn’t cutting it anymore. Now, OpenAI is tapping into the game. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to launch its own jobs platform next year. The platform “will have knowledgeable, experienced candidates at every level, and opportunities for anyone looking to put their skills to use,” according to a blog post from CEO of Applications Fidji Simo. It will also help small businesses find “AI talent” for specific needs. The tech giant is also getting in on the certifications industry, which made $6.4 billion in revenue last year, according to IBIS world. OpenAI’s options will include certifications from intro-level all the way to advanced AI usage, such as prompt engineering. They’re not the first company to inject AI into the job search process. LinkedIn started incorporating the technology into users’ job searches in 2023. As of May, Premium users can ask LinkedIn’s AI to find personalized jobs through a chat. Companies like Coursera, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and even LinkedIn have long had their own “AI fluency” or “Intro to AI” certifications for workers looking for that extra badge. Still, for those struggling to land their next job, Forbes contributors have a few suggestions: For one, look at niche job boards, writes Bryan Robinson. It’s easy for people to spam LinkedIn postings with résumés and applications for jobs they’re not quite qualified for, causing some qualified candidates to get buried. By using lesser-known job boards like Wellfound, Otta or FlexJobs, your odds of getting a response could increase. And once you’ve scheduled an interview, you can use AI as your personal coach, suggests contributor Justin Sablich. Custom interview prompts, like using the STAR—situation, task, action, result—method or asking the model to act as an adversarial interviewer can help you go deeper with each question. But always be wary of the specific information you give the chatbot. Have any other tips on finding your perfect job in this new market, or questions over your own search? My inbox is always open.

But why was the revision so high? New businesses, reports Forbes’ Brandon Kochkodin, as well as an actual count of jobs added versus the initial survey estimate. Stanford holds the best MBA program this year, according to LinkedIn’s annual ranking of postgraduate programs. Cofounder, CEO and product manager are the most common titles to come out of the school. Real estate giant Brookfield declared the return-to-office debate “over” in its latest investor day presentation. The news comes as Microsoft employees will be required to be in the office three days a week starting in 2026. Though this caused an online stir, the slight increase from 2.5 days fell in line with the majority of Fortune 100 companies, according to FlexIndex. Lawyers representing powerful names like Sean Diddy Combs and Elon Musk are some of the Top Lawyers in America this year, according to Forbes’ annual roll call of the country’s high-caliber counsel. Unlike during his first term, President Donald Trump has not yet declared the start of Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15 through October 15) as of Tuesday morning. Some celebrations have been slimmed down or even canceled this year amid fears over immigration raids and efforts to combat diversity, equity and inclusion.

Title: Waymo's robotaxi expansion will get a Lyft in Nashville next year

Robotaxi leader Waymo's driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber Robotaxi leader Waymo on Wednesday announced that its driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year while heading in a new direction by teaming up with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber. The Nashville plan calls for robotaxi ride requests to initially be limited to Waymo's own mobile app before expanding on to Lyft's app later next year. Waymo's decision to work with Lyft in Tennessee's biggest city means its robotaxis will now be available on the apps of the two largest ride-hailing services in the U.S. As part of earlier expansions, Waymo is already dispatching robotaxis through Uber's app i n Atlanta and Austin, Texas. Electric automaker Tesla has been testing a limited driverless service in Austin in an attempt to fulfill an ambitious plan that CEO Elon Musk has been pursuing for the past decade. Even if it's in only one city, getting Waymo's industry-leading robotaxis on its app could help Lyft continue its recovery from the pandemic restrictions that decimated demand for rides. Uber bounced back from the pandemic more quickly, a comeback that has been reflected in both its financial results and market value, which has tripled since the end of 2019. Lyft's stock price, in contrast, remains about 50% below where it stood at the end of 2019. As part of its turnaround efforts, Lyft hired former Amazon executive David Risher as its CEO two years ago. Risher previously negotiated a partnership with May Mobility that is now providing driverless rides in Atlanta in competition with Waymo and Uber. This is not the first time that Waymo and Lyft have worked together. During the testing phase of its robotaxi service in Phoenix in 2019, Waymo offered a limited number of rides through Lyft. That arrangement ended after Waymo completed the Phoenix tests and began accepting driverless rides from all interested passengers on its own app more than five years ago. Since starting in Arizona, Waymo's robotaxis have provided more than 250,000 trips in cities from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. Waymo, which began in 2009 as a secret project within Google, also plans to expand into Dallas next year. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

For most of Big Tech, 2025 has been a solid year financially — Intel being the notable exception. But for employees, job security feels increasingly fragile. According to an analysis by RationalFX, a total of 166,387 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2025. The report pulls information from U.S. WARN notices, job board TrueUp, TechCrunch, and the layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi. Intel tops the list. The struggling chipmaker plans to cut around 34,000 jobs this year as it tries to streamline operations and reset its strategy. Microsoft isn’t far behind. The Redmond-based giant has already gone through multiple rounds of layoffs: roughly 6,000 roles in April and another 9,000 in July, RationalFX foresees a total of at least 19,215 positions in 2025 eliminated in the name of efficiency. India’s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ranks third, with an estimated 12,000 employees let go this year, largely as part of cost-cutting measures and the rollout of AI-driven automation. Cuts haven’t stopped there. Almost every major player has made reductions: IBM is phasing out about 9,000 HR roles, shifting many of those responsibilities to AI. STMicroelectronics, the European chipmaker, is cutting 5,000 jobs. Salesforce shed 1,000 positions in February and another 4,000 in September. Meta has already let go of 3,720 staff this year, continuing a pattern from previous years. Amazon eliminated over 3,350 jobs, including through the closure of all its Canadian warehouses. Oracle laid off 3,000 workers in just the past two months. Even Elon Musk’s xAI joined the trend, dismissing 500 employees who had worked on training its chatbot Grok. AI itself is emerging as a major factor. Analysts estimate that roughly 37,702 of the layoffs this year were directly tied to automation and the adoption of AI tools that replaced human tasks outright. Looking ahead, RationalFX forecasts that total tech layoffs could climb to 235,000 by the end of 2025. RationalFX

Title: Mark Zuckerberg wowed Meta skeptics this time last year. He's about to try to do it again.

Meta's vision of AI-powered glasses as the next must-have device is about to face a major test. CEO Mark Zuckerberg set the bar high at Meta Connect in 2024 with the not-for-mass-market technology in its Orion glasses. Now he has to take the next step in marketable wearables — and get consumers to shell out. Zuckerberg is expected to take the stage at Meta's Menlo Park headquarters for the company's annual Meta Connect conference to lay out his vision for Meta glasses, headsets, and the future of contextual AI. The stakes are high. Meta is spending billions on AI research and hardware while competitors like Apple, OpenAI, and Google are chasing the same market. Meta Connect is Zuckerberg's chance to prove the company's sprawling investments in wearables, software, and AI are converging into something consumers would potentially pay more for. Last year, Zuckerberg generated major buzz with a prototype of the Orion glasses, Meta's first true attempt at fully holographic AR. He also laid out a vision of wider adoption of AI glasses. Though still a developer-only product, Orion impressed early testers, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Reddit's Steve Huffman. The demo also earned positive reviews from Business Insider's own Peter Kafka, who said he would "buy them in a heartbeat." At the event, Zuckerberg also rolled out updates to existing products, such as transparent Ray-Ban Meta frames, new celebrity voices for Meta AI, and a budget-friendly Quest 3S headset at $299. Meta's stock rose more than 2% during Zuckerberg's keynote, and the Ray-Ban smart glasses also became a hit, with sales surpassing 2 million units by early 2025. In May, Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI now has around 1 billion monthly active users across Meta's apps. Leaks and reports suggest Zuckerberg will use this year's keynote to shift focus from experimental prototypes to products that it hopes will be widely adopted. Orion is equipped with cutting-edge technology and costs $10,000 to produce per pair. Meta's test this year is whether it can release a stepping-stone product in terms of price point and capabilities, and whether Zuckerberg could convince consumers to pay more for a pair of glasses than the current Ray-Ban Meta model, which starts at $299. Here is what we might see: This year's Meta Connect event comes during an escalating talent war in Silicon Valley. Not including the billions that Reality Labs, the division behind AR/VR, has lost in 2025, Meta has been dangling multimillion-dollar compensation packages to lure AI researchers and hardware engineers, and it seems to be working. Earlier this year, the company launched Meta Superintelligence Labs under Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. To bring Wang on board, Meta invested $14.8 billion in the startup for a 49% non-voting stake. In July, Meta lured away a co-creator of ChatGPT from OpenAI and appointed him chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs. The company has also recruited three researchers behind OpenAI's Zurich office — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — who had spent time at Google's DeepMind. With all this AI talent and new hardware, Meta needs to wow consumers and Wall Street again. Jump to

Tech Layoffs in 2025 Already Top 166,000 Tech companies are facing another wave of massive layoffs, with over 166,000 jobs lost so far in 2025 and projections nearing 235,000. Industry giants like Intel and Microsoft lead the cuts, with AI increasingly replacing human roles in customer service and operations. When COVID-19 struck, many people lost their jobs. People stopped going out as much, and a number of businesses had to shut their doors for good. However, the tech space saw a boom. More people stayed home to work, which meant there was an increase in demand for digital products and services, leading to a hiring frenzy. This all came to a head once the pandemic passed. Now, it looks like layoffs at tech companies are happening again. According to a report from RationalFX, the tech companies are going through massive layoffs in 2025. The report claims that there have been about 166,000 layoffs globally in 2025 so far, and it is estimated to reach as many as 235,000 by the end of the year. This means on average, there are 645 jobs being lost a day since January 2025. The report also reveals which companies have been laying off the most workers. At the top of the list is Intel, with an estimated 33,900 layoffs. This doesn’t come as a surprise. Intel has been struggling as of late, no thanks in part to the rise of AI which has led to an increase in demand for chips from companies like NVIDIA. Intel has also been a bit slow on the mobile front, allowing TSMC and Qualcomm to dominate the scene. Plus, the controversies surrounding some of its CPUs in recent years haven’t done them any favors. Microsoft comes in second place at 19,215 layoffs. We’re also seeing around 9,000 layoffs at IBM, 5,000 at Salesforce, 3,720 at Meta, and 3,350 at Amazon. What’s worrying is that some of these layoffs might not necessarily have to do with companies performing badly. But rather, some of these companies have found that replacing human workers with AI might actually be better financially. The report revealed that companies such as Salesforce slashed its customer support workforce by about half. This is because AI agents were more than capable of doing those jobs. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, also went through similar layoffs, thanks (or no thanks) to AI. IBM’s layoffs are also in part due to AI, where the company is looking to cut costs and streamline its operations. It is true that AI has the potential to take some of our jobs. Things like customer service makes sense. If AI can answer simple questions that customers have quickly and efficiently, why hire a human that might get it wrong? It is worrying, but that seems to be the direction we’re heading towards. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Alphabet Rides The AI Wave Over The $3 Trillion Mark

Alphabet is the newest member of the $3 trillion club, and it’s counting on rolling AI ambitions to take it higher. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Tech giant Alphabet joined the $3 trillion club this week, making it the fourth company to reach that impressive market cap. Certainly, you’ve heard about the other three — Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — but, if not, just Google them. A favorable ruling earlier this month in an antitrust case against Alphabet kickstarted the stock’s latest upward swing. A US court ruled the company didn’t need to sell off its Chrome browser or Android operating system, two outcomes investors feared would cut into the company’s core biz. Then there’s what pushed the stock over the top into $3 trillion territory: growing enthusiasm for Alphabet’s AI investments. Alphabet’s stock has climbed more than 70% from its April low. Its cloud-computing unit’s revenue surged a better-than-expected 32% in the second quarter, lifted by demand for new AI offerings like the Gemini chatbot from its Google subsidiary. Earlier this month, Google Cloud’s CEO said the company’s already made billions from AI and has $106 billion in customer demand for its cloud computing services. The success highlights Alphabet’s efforts to diversify beyond its advertising businesses, including at Google and YouTube, which make up more than half of revenue. And, following Google Cloud’s success, Alphabet’s bringing AI to more products: Surface Tension: Fears of the AI bubble bursting haven’t been realized, as investors continue to bet that massive investments into the tech will pay off. AI chip-maker Nvidia is still the most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion. And Oracle signed a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI last week, pouring fuel on its stock’s rally. If AI is a bubble, it seems to be made of something more durable than soapy water. And yet, last week, Tesla scored a couple key brownie points from Wall Street analysts. So why the optimism? Unfortunately for Intel, the deal does not provide a direct lifeline to its floundering chipmaking foundry business. Meta will likely soon face competition from Amazon, Alphabet, Snap and other tech firms with augmented-reality glasses in development. Quantum computers are expected to solve previously unsolvable problems (or ones that would take ages) across industries. Apple’s latest generation of iPhones were debuted with modest aplomb last week. Presales show the company has plenty to be confident about. Between 2000 and 2002, after the dot com bubble popped, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Oracle said its remaining performance obligations is now sitting at $455 billion. That’s up 359% from where it stood just a year ago. Mistral has been hailed by policymakers as key to Europe’s ambitions to compete with dominant US and Asian rivals. iPhone sales surged to $44.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, besting analysts’ $40 billion expectations and rising 14% year-over-year. Pubmatic’s lawsuit comes after a US Judge ruled in April that Google was maintaining an illegal monopoly in the ad tech industry. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, having successfully diversified into cloud computing, is now making a push into artificial intelligence. So far, Tesla has launched limited rideshare services in Austin and the Bay area, and it’s looking to expand into Florida, Arizona and Nevada. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Google's Nano Banana Moment: 50% Upside For GOOG Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google's stock has been making headlines, surpassing the $3 trillion market cap milestone as investor confidence grows. But here’s the bigger takeaway: even after this rally, Google still trades at a notable discount compared to Big Tech peers like Amazon and Microsoft. This recent surge isn’t just market hype—it could mark the start of a 50% rally for GOOG stock as the market finally recognizes that Google deserves premium valuations and reconsiders its pricing. The narrative around Google and AI is shifting. Remember when there was widespread fear that AI would cannibalize Google Search? That fear is quickly fading. Google’s Gemini, especially its viral “nano banana” feature, has propelled the Gemini app to the #1 spot on Apple’s App Store in the U.S. This shows that AI can enhance Google’s core offerings instead of threatening them. The market is finally acknowledging what we’ve been saying all along: treating AI as an existential threat to Google was always an overreaction. Instead, AI is turning out to be a complementary force that strengthens Google’s ecosystem. While we’ll explore Google stock’s upside below, if you want growth with less volatility than holding a single stock, check out the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – Can Natera Stock Reach $500? Here’s where the numbers get interesting. Google has long been the overlooked Big Tech player in terms of valuation multiples, and the data paints a compelling picture: The fundamentals say yes. Consider these key metrics: Microsoft’s premium valuation is warranted, but Google’s numbers aren’t far behind. Much of Google’s discount came from regulatory overhang—but with that mostly resolved, the rerating case has never been stronger. The move from 22x to 28x earnings shows this rerating has already begun. For Google to command Amazon- and Microsoft-like multiples (35x+), investors must see these key developments: Given these risks, investors could consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 blend). This quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks offers a way to benefit from market upswings while cushioning downside risk, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Google’s path to a 50% stock price gain isn’t wishful thinking—it’s based on a valuation gap that’s increasingly hard to ignore. The company has all the right elements: dominant market position, improving AI story, regulatory clarity, and solid financials. The real question isn’t whether Google deserves a higher multiple, but how soon the market will acknowledge that it’s moved beyond the “search disruption” and antitrust concerns that kept its valuation muted. With AI proving to complement—not compete with—Google’s core business, we may be witnessing the early stages of a major rerating.

‘Tis the season. Everyone is gearing up for that time of year — holiday shopping. Is your businesses’ search engine optimization (SEO) strategy ready for the holidays? If you just broke out into a cold sweat thinking about it, don’t worry — we’re here to help. We’ll explore tips, strategies, and budget-friendly tricks to make sure your business is found this holiday season (and beyond) — and how you can use your customer relationship management (CRM) tools to turn your top searchers into your top customers. What you’ll learn: AI search, including Google’s AI Overviews, Bing Copilot answers, and other LLM-powered engines, increasingly shapes how shoppers discover products during the holidays. A holiday AI SEO marketing strategy is a tactic to help small businesses appear in search engines and get seen for the holiday season — any season, really. Good SEO means making sure your digital presence is fully optimized, from your web copy to your store’s product descriptions to your opening hours, no matter what season it is. Let’s dig into why this is important. Effective SEO increases your brand’s visibility, driving more qualified leads to your website. These leads can then be captured and managed within your CRM system. In the reverse, content optimized for SEO can provide valuable information for your sales and marketing teams, enriching the data within your CRM. Also, by optimizing your website with the latest in AI-enabled SEO, you can personalize their experience and tailor your CRM efforts to nurture them more effectively. The future of SEO is AI-powered, and small businesses can get in on it too. The holidays are one of the few times of year when being small is an advantage. Surveys show 93% of U.S. consumers plan to “shop small” during the holiday season, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that eight in ten small businesses say Q4 is critical for annual profit. Modern LLMs are trained to detect and surface businesses that align with high-intent queries like “local gifts near me,” “independent bookstores with fast shipping,” or “family-owned bakery Christmas pies.” To be recognized, SMBs need to make these signals explicit. Practical steps: How a CRM can help: A CRM allows you to segment your customer base and understand their past purchases and preferences. This means you can create highly targeted promotions, gift guides, and website copy that resonate with specific customer groups, increasing the likelihood they’ll click through from search or answer engine results. No matter where you are on your journey as a small business, you can get started with Starter Suite — the all-in-one CRM for SMBs. Customer reviews are vital, but they’re not the only trust signal that matters in AI search. Answer engines cross-reference multiple sources before including a business in an answer. Local press mentions, chamber of commerce directories, event sponsorships, and nonprofit partnerships are all citations that machines can parse and validate. Practical steps: How a CRM can help: A CRM can help manage these efforts by centralizing contact information, tracking outreach, segmenting customer data, automating reminders for updates, and managing event planning. By proactively managing these diverse trust signals, businesses can improve their visibility and credibility in AI search.. Shoppers are no longer just typing. The proliferation of voice assistants and visual search tools means your business must be discoverable beyond traditional text queries. In fact, Google Lens reports billions of monthly image searches alone, so SMBs should think beyond text. Get your website voice-ready: Make your images findable: Multimodal AI discovery isn’t hypothetical; it’s happening now. A shopper might snap a photo of a candle on TikTok and ask, “Where can I buy this locally?” in search, and land on your store if your assets are properly tagged. How a CRM can help: By organizing customer data and preferences, a CRM enables businesses to create more targeted and relevant content that can be surfaced through voice and visual searches. Also, CRM data can help businesses keep branding and product information consistent across their online presence. Large retailers publish long holiday gift guides on their sites, but SMBs can win by publishing specific guides focused on certain topics or personas. In an AI-first world, specificity wins. AI overviews often surface micro-content that maps tightly to niche intents: “teacher gifts under $25,” “last-minute local pickup in Brooklyn,” “eco-friendly hostess gifts.” These focused guides often map directly to LLM-driven answer boxes, which pull concise, niche content to satisfy specific shopping intents. For SMBs, creating multiple focused guides is both achievable and impactful. Instead of pouring effort into a 2,000-word omnibus guide, launch three to five smaller landing pages: Each page should feature short answer capsules, such as: “Hand-poured soy candle, $22, available for same-day pickup. Perfect for teacher gifts – eco-friendly and long-lasting.” These capsules can be lifted directly into AI summaries, while the pages themselves capture long-tail traffic. Cross-link guides to relevant product pages and vice versa, ensuring both human shoppers and AI systems see the connections. How a CRM can help: By segmenting customer data, a CRM enables businesses to identify niche intents and create relevant guides that capture long-tail traffic. Additionally, a CRM can help businesses cross-link guides to relevant product pages. Learn how autonomous AI can scale your small business for efficient growth in our free e-book. Google’s guidance emphasizes E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. This humanization isn’t just about trust; it’s a critical differentiator. SMBs have an edge here. While big-box retailers rely on mass-produced descriptions, you can signal authenticity with small touches. What works: Research shows consumers increasingly value authenticity: 88% say they’re more likely to buy again after a great service experience, according to the latest State of the Connected Customer report. AI raters are trained to look for this, too — pages that show lived experience (“we tested,” “our team recommends”) are more likely to surface than generic, stock copy. How a CRM can help: A CRM can help small businesses demonstrate E-E-A-T and authenticity by managing customer interactions and data that inform personalized content, such as customer testimonials, product recommendations, and staff-curated content. Additionally, a CRM can help businesses track customer interactions and feedback, allowing them to refine their content and improve overall customer experience. AI engines don’t just crawl websites; they also increasingly draw from community conversations on social media. Mentions in Reddit threads, TikTok videos, or Quora answers can seed authority signals that flow back into AI-curated summaries, acting as powerful, unlinked brand mentions. For example, shoppers often post on Reddit boards like r/Gifts or r/BuyItForLife asking for holiday ideas. If a satisfied customer mentions your handmade product there, it becomes part of the training data that models like Perplexity or ChatGPT may cite. Similarly, TikTok’s algorithm surfaces local businesses for trending holiday gift tags, and AI scrapes those public posts. Practical plays: AI engines are trained to identify consensus, along with other things. A handful of high-signal mentions in the right community can outweigh dozens of low-quality backlinks. For SMBs, that’s a winnable path to visibility. How a CRM can help: A CRM can track customer mentions, reviews, and feedback, helping businesses to identify opportunities to encourage happy customers to share their experiences and showcase their products in community forums. By integrating social media data, a CRM can also help businesses monitor their authority signals and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. Cross-platform visibility means your business information is identical, and present, across the digital platforms that AI reconciles: your site, Google Business Profile (GBP), marketplaces (Amazon, Etsy, Walmart), and social shops. AI systems (and people) mistrust mismatches, and guidance from Google stresses consistent, helpful, non-commodity content. Parity checklist (check weekly during peak holiday times): Why it matters: AI will show fewer options. Brands with coherent facts across touchpoints are safer to include. How a CRM can help: A CRM centralizes your customer and product data, ensuring consistency across your website, Google Business Profile, marketplaces, and social media platforms. By managing this data in one place, businesses can easily update product information, pricing, and other details across multiple channels, reducing the risk of mismatches and inconsistencies. Set up your digital storefront, engage customers, and sell more using a commerce-ready platform with integrated tools for every sale. Google’s holiday research highlights how spur-of-the-moment mobile sessions drive decisions; four in five smartphone holiday shoppers use their phone in spare moments, and those micro-moments add up. Here’s how to make sure your SMB site is set up for these micro-moments. 90-second purchase checklist: How a CRM can help: A CRM can help small businesses capture shoppers on the go by managing detail-heavy customer interactions and data that inform targeted marketing efforts, such as SMS reminders and instant promotions. Small Business Saturday, taking place every fall, is a moment to compound visibility: spikes in local search, social shares, and reviews build authority that carries into December. The SBA cites long-running consumer participation and cumulative spend; Constant Contact found one-third of annual revenue can hinge on the holiday season for many SMBs. Here’s how you can get it on the Small Business Saturday traffic in the week leading up to November 5: How a CRM can help: With a CRM, you can automate and personalize your marketing efforts, such as sending targeted emails and SMS messages, and track customer behavior and preferences for future marketing strategies. Additionally, a CRM can help you manage your business’s online presence by storing customer data, preferences, and interactions in one place, making it easier to execute any Small Business Saturday marketing plans. The biggest SMB constraint isn’t strategy; it’s time. That’s why automation should be targeted at the areas where consistency matters most to AI: feeds, inventory, and customer communication. Automation frees you to focus on building trust (content, reviews, partnerships). For many SMBs, platforms like Salesforce Starter Suite and Pro Suite make this achievable – unifying storefront, CRM, and simple marketing automation in one place. Automation priorities: How a CRM can help: By unifying storefront, CRM, and marketing automation in one place, a CRM enables businesses to refresh product feeds multiple times a day, automate “out of stock” updates, and schedule timely reminders for shipping cutoffs. By taking this busy work off your plate, a CRM lets you focus on the bigger picture. Learn how your business can benefit from this out-of-the-box CRM.

AI search emphasizes structured data, local relevance, and authentic content, shifting focus from traditional keyword stuffing to providing clear, consistent, and human-centric information that AI can easily understand and surface. What is “E-E-A-T” and why is it important for small businesses in AI search? E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. For small businesses, it’s crucial because AI values authentic, lived experience and signals of trustworthiness. Highlighting founder stories, staff picks, and behind-the-scenes content can demonstrate E-E-A-T and improve AI visibility. How can small businesses improve social media to improve their AI search visibility? AI engines increasingly draw information from community conversations on social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit. Encouraging customers to post authentic content and engaging in niche forums can create strong authority signals that AI models may cite, acting as powerful, unlinked brand mentions. What are “micro-moments” in holiday shopping, and how can SMBs optimize for them? Micro-moments refer to brief, spur-of-the-moment mobile sessions where shoppers make quick decisions. SMBs can optimize by ensuring fast website loading speeds, offering quick payment options like guest checkout, providing “buy online, pick up in store” (BOPIS) capabilities, and offering instant gift cards or SMS reminders for shipping or availability cutoffs. What role does a CRM system play in a small business’ holiday AI marketing strategy? A CRM system centralizes customer data, product information, and marketing efforts, ensuring consistency across all digital touchpoints. This allows businesses to automate tasks like inventory updates and personalized communications, freeing up time and ensuring data accuracy, which is critical for AI visibility.
