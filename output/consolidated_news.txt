Amazon has filed notice with the state of Nevada for employee layoffs as the company moves forward with closing its Reno fulfillment center this summer. A WARN notice was sent by Amazon on Monday, June 2, and posted by the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation on Wednesday morning. It confirmed that it will close its facility at 8000 N. Virginia St. on Aug. 2, 2025. WARN notices are 60-day notifications required by law when a company enacts massive layoffs. The notice is named after the 1989 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. WARN notices are required during: The Reno Gazette Journal first confirmed the planned closure of the Reno facility with Amazon in October. At the time, the facility employed about 500 people. Today, Amazon’s Reno fulfillment center has about 325 people working at the site, according to the company. Amazon has also provided transfers to more than 100 employees. “As we wind down operations at our Reno fulfillment center, we’re working closely with all affected employees to provide the latest information about transfer opportunities at other Amazon facilities in Reno and elsewhere,” an Amazon spokesperson told the Reno Gazette Journal. “For employees who choose not to remain with Amazon following this closure, we’re offering support through this transition.” Amazon also confirmed that it still plans to open a new same-day delivery facility in south Reno. Amazon filed a building permit in September for a new facility at the 580 South industrial center just across Mount Rose Highway from the Shayden Summit Reno mall. Employees affected by the closure of the Reno fulfillment will be given advance notice about job opportunities at the new same-day delivery center, according to Amazon. Construction of the new south Reno facility, however, has been pushed back from its initial late 2025 completion date. Work on Amazon’s new south Reno facility is expected to continue through 2026, Amazon confirmed. Amazon first opened its RNO4 fulfillment center in Reno in 2015. At the time, the 630,000-square-foot facility — which shipped its first package on Jan. 21 — was touted not just for its size but also technologies such as embedded wires that sync with forklifts and allow for the use of very narrow aisles plus a machine that can build on-demand custom-size boxes as needed. In just a decade, however, the Reno fulfillment center is now considered as an older facility and Amazon decided to not renew its lease. The company is also focusing more on increasing its number of smaller same-day delivery centers. “We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where we open new facilities, enhance existing facilities, and close others — including business need as well as how we can best improve the experience for employees, customers and partners,” said Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly at the time. “With our lease expiring at our facility in Reno, we’ve made the difficult decision to end operations out of that site next year.”

Title: Roads policing numbers at historic low of 618 gardaí, figures show

Full Content:
The number of gardaí involved in roads policing units has dropped to a historic low of 618, according to the latest Department of Justice figures. There has been a steady decline since 2009 when official figures for those engaged in roads policing began to be regularly published. That year 1,046 gardaí were assigned to road policing duties and the numbers involved fell to a low of 623 in 2017. They rose over the next four years to 736 in 2021 but have fallen again, down to 627 last year. In January this year the number of gardaí in the units dropped to 626, to 623 in February and was down to 618 by the end of April. Every region and county has seen the number of roads policing gardaí drop, in some cases by more than 50 per cent since 2009. Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the Oireachtas Transport Committee in May last year “we plan to add 75 gardaí to roads policing this year and a further 75 in 2025, and working towards this, we are proactively recruiting into our roads policing units”. A recruitment campaign was undertaken in eastern, north-western and southern regions last year. But Susan Gray of road safety campaign group Parc said the figures show a reduction of nine members at the end of April compared to last year. “They are just playing catch up all the time.” The figures show the Sligo/Leitrim Garda Division had 23 members in 2021, but it was down to 11 in February this year. Donegal had 31 Garda roads policing members in 2021, which fell to 21 last year, a reduction of 10 officers in three years. Official Road Safety Authority data shows 17 road deaths in Donegal last year, “the highest number since 2010 when 19 died”, Ms Gray said. Sixty-nine people have died on Irish roads so far this year, she said. In the Dublin Metropolitan Area the numbers have dropped from their 2009 high but have remained consistent over the last two to three years. In Dublin’s eastern region which goes from Dún Laoghaire to Stepaside and takes in Dundrum, Blackrock, Shankill and Cabinteely, the numbers dropped from 18 in 2009 to four in 2023 and rose to nine the following year, where they have remained. In Laois/Offaly there were 42 dedicated roads policing officers in 2009 which fell to 24 in 2023 and dropped to 18 in April this year. “It is very disappointing,” said Ms Gray. “Everybody talks about road safety being a priority and everywhere we look it’s obvious it’s not a priority,” she said. “We hoped to see the figures going up rather than down for gardaí involved in roads policing.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter Marie O’Halloran is Parliamentary Correspondent of The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock removed from Texas investment blacklist after rolling back woke policies: ‘We’re seeing a course correction’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/04/business/blackrock-removed-from-texas-investment-blacklist-after-rolling-back-esg-policies/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T16:49:12Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has been removed from Texas’s investment blacklist, a major reversal that follows the asset management giant’s decision to scale back some of its controversial climate commitments. The move, announced Tuesday by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar, ends a three-year ban that had prevented state pension and investment funds from doing business with the world’s largest asset manager over its environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies. “This marks a meaningful shift,” Hegar said. “Texas has played a leadership role in standing up to financial institutions that try to push political agendas under the guise of environmental concern. We’re seeing a course correction.” Texas funds hold an estimated $50 billion in assets. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Post: “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter.” “More than $4 billion in Texas funds are invested with BlackRock,” the rep said. The Larry Fink-led company had $11.55 trillion in assets under management at the end of the fourth quarter in 2024. We are “proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state,” the spokesperson said “These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” BlackRock had drawn fire from Republican-led states like Texas for supporting climate-focused investment strategies and for its involvement in initiatives aimed at reducing global emissions. But over the past year, the New York City-based firm has distanced itself from some of those efforts. In January, it exited the Climate Action 100+ investor group. It also withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, a UN-backed coalition focused on reducing portfolio emissions. The rollback appears to have helped smooth tensions with officials in Texas, where fossil fuels remain a key pillar of the economy and political identity. The Texas comptroller’s office had added BlackRock and other financial firms to its restricted list in 2022 after lawmakers passed legislation targeting perceived boycotts of the oil and gas industry. That law required the comptroller to identify firms that “discriminate” against fossil fuel companies and to direct state funds to divest from them. Since then, the blacklist has become a flashpoint in the national debate over ESG investing. While many conservatives have argued that large asset managers wield too much influence in promoting progressive agendas, others — including some within the financial industry — warned that the restrictions risked limiting returns and politicizing fiduciary decision-making. BlackRock has repeatedly pushed back on claims that it engages in coordinated efforts to undermine the fossil fuel sector. “We never set out to penalize any company,” Hegar said Tuesday, “but we made clear there would be consequences for putting politics ahead of financial performance.” Despite the thaw in relations, BlackRock remains the subject of a separate legal fight with a coalition of Republican attorneys general, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who allege the firm has violated antitrust laws through its ESG commitments. BlackRock has denied the charges, calling them baseless. Advertisement

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is ‘motivated by fear and guilt,’ biographer says

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang may run one of the most important companies in the world, but he can’t credit his success to the power of positive thinking. “I think the most surprising thing about Jensen is that he’s almost totally driven by negative emotions,” said Stephen Witt, who spent hours interviewing the Nvidia co-founder for his book, “The Thinking Machine.” “This is his fuel. This is his gasoline, [and it’s] what makes him go is this anxiety,” he told CNBC. According to Witt, Huang fears Nvidia (NVDA), which is valued at more than $3.3 trillion, could fall apart at any time. Witt said he was surprised by how much negative emotions seem to motivate Huang, who “becomes very uncomfortable and nervous when things are going well.” Huang does best when acting like Nvidia is “on the brink of failure at all times,” Witt said. “This is the narrative he generates around himself — that he could fail at any time and be disgraced. And this is what motivates him.” Witt continued: “Jensen, of course, is an obvious, huge go-getter, but it’s all coming from this place of almost beating himself up for not working hard enough all the time. I didn’t expect to see that.” While that mindset might sound exhausting, it has worked well for Huang, who according to Forbes, is the 16th richest person in the world in 2025. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 with two colleagues, and steered the company through an period where it almost had to close up shop just a few years later. Now, the chipmaker has never been more prolific. It reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter this year.

Unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, who first reported the news, that the bank will also begin taking crypto holdings into account when assessing clients' net worth and liquid assets. This would mean that crypto gets the same treatment as real estate and vehicles when assessing a client's ability to repay a loan. "We can confirm the contents of the Bloomberg story are accurate," a JP Morgan spokesperson told Decrypt in an email. The bank has had a love-hate relationship with Bitcoin. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has long been a Bitcoin skeptic, but recently said the bank would begin allowing customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum. The billionaire banker has said that Bitcoin is a "pet rock" and that crypto's "true use case" was for criminals. But the bank has long used blockchain—a technology launched by Bitcoin's creator—for its own projects to move money. JP Morgan is the latest high-profile traditional finance giant to offer clients exposure to crypto—a multi-trillion dollar asset class. The likes of Fidelity and Standard Chartered have also this year launched digital asset trading services for both institutional and retail clients. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, giving investors previously shut out from the crypto investing world the ability to buy and sell digital assets via shares that trade on a stock exchange.

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world

By GRAHAM LEE BREWER NEW YORK (AP) — Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration’s recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. “We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez’s organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It’s now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country’s agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID’s adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden’s administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings “are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change.

Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) are falling Wednesday after the company's revenue forecasts came in short of estimates, but analysts are staying bullish on the cybersecurity software maker. Analysts from Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Oppenheimer all raised their price targets for CrowdStrike to $470, $450, $520, and $520, respectively. Of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 25 call CrowdStrike a "buy," while four others rate it as a "hold," with an average price target of $488.39. Bank of America analysts, lifting their price target but downgrading the stock to "neutral," said they "favor CrowdStrike's fundamentals and growth prospects, but believe the valuation leaves only limited upside from the current level," adding that they expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of this year but slow in the coming years. UBS analysts, retaining their $545 price target as one of the most bullish on Wall Street, said they are "inclined to look past some of the near-term revenue headwinds from the company’s outage-related discounting program," which pressured first-quarter revenue and CrowdStrike's second-quarter forecasts. Analysts from Deutsche Bank said they are "bullish on CEO George Kurtz's articulation of how AI is expanding the attack surface and driving the need for better cyber defense (and thus more CrowdStrike)." However, they added that they "remain on the sidelines given valuation and our concerns for consolidation cyclicality." CrowdStrike shares were down 4% in recent trading to roughly $466, but are still up about 37% since the start of the year.

Title: The Convergence of TradFi and Digital Asset Markets – A Maturing Ecosystem

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The line between traditional and crypto markets is actively being redrawn. As digital asset markets mature, the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and digital markets is accelerating, resulting in a more mature, institutional-grade ecosystem shaped by the frameworks, expectations and operational resilience that have historically characterized TradFi. Recent developments underscore a paradigm shift in how digital assets are perceived by institutions. The U.S. government’s announcement of a strategic digital asset reserve, consisting of bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, signals strong institutional validation. In parallel, more than eleven U.S. states have shown interest in or are actively working on bitcoin treasury bills. Sovereign investors such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) have disclosed significant positions, with a $436.9 million stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) as of December 31, 2024. These aren’t speculative moves, but rather concerted investments to stay at the forefront of an evolving financial system. Support from these governments is reinforcing institutional engagement, marking a turning point where the risk of missing out outweighs the risk of exposure to the digital assets ecosystem. Previously, institutional participation in digital assets was constrained by high volatility, regulatory uncertainty and fragmented infrastructure. Now, regulated custodians offer institutional-grade solutions, while trading platforms provide improved access and reliable execution. The expansion of risk management tools — including hedging, credit facilities and market surveillance — has enhanced the operational stability for a space once known for volatility. These developments have lowered barriers to entry, enabling traditional institutions to approach digital assets with familiar risk and compliance frameworks. Institutional adoption is further fueled by products that mirror traditional markets while leveraging blockchain advantages. Today’s institutional offerings include spot & derivatives markets, yield-bearing products, ETFs & in-kind redemptions and depositary receipts — all designed with similar underwriting logic and performance expectations. The expansion of futures, options and structured products in crypto mirrors the mechanics of TradFi derivatives. These instruments provide price discovery, risk hedging and speculative capabilities that align with institutional mandates. Yield-bearing products like staking, crypto lending and tokenized fixed-income are being designed with yield profiles resembling TradFi. These structures provide fixed or floating returns while incorporating risk metrics familiar to institutions. One of the most popular products has been spot bitcoin ETPs. Nasdaq’s proposed in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF further align crypto ETFs with traditional counterparts, boosting efficiency and liquidity. Additionally, crypto depositary receipts enable institutions to access digital assets without direct custody, bridging traditional markets and crypto in a regulated, familiar structure. Institutional investors are engaging through structures that blend traditional and digital techniques: hybrid funds, separately managed accounts (SMAs) and bespoke mandates. These tailor exposure while maintaining operational familiarity, providing institutions with regulated pathways to participate in this evolving ecosystem. Regulatory clarity remains critical. Recent SEC moves and a more crypto-forward administration signal openness to clearer frameworks, encouraging increased institutional engagement. Some traditional players are still taking a wait-and-see approach, cautiously observing market infrastructure and regulatory signals before committing capital at scale. On the other hand, firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Citadel are entering the DeFi space. Institutional adoption is unlocking portfolio diversification, enhanced market efficiency and a more structured approach to risk management, all pointing to a more robust financial ecosystem. The institutionalization of digital assets and its convergence with traditional financial systems is not a passing trend, but a structural realignment of markets. Forward-looking institutions are not just participating, they’re supporting the emerging ecosystem. For CIOs and allocators, this convergence presents an inflection point. The ability to navigate digital assets with TradFi discipline and DeFi innovation is becoming a key differentiator — placing emphasis on the importance of partnering with firms who have deep experience across both markets. As the financial landscape evolves, institutions that stay informed and insightful will find themselves positioned to adapt and thrive.

Her new book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, and it explores how the definition of what it means to be a genius has changed radically over the centuries, how it became linked to all sorts of weird biological theories, and how Elon Musk has come to personify genius in our time (and whether his failure at the Department of Government Efficiency spells the end of his genius moment). Lewis and Reason's Nick Gillespie also talk about The Beatles; William Shockley, who turned to racial science after winning a Nobel Prize for helping to invent the transistor; and her notorious 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson for British GQ, which has racked up over 70 million views. 0:00— Introduction 1:36— The Genius Myth 7:20— How dead geniuses fueled national myths 11:30— Thomas Carlyle and the Great Man theory 18:18— Are inventions inevitable? 23:22— Francis Galton and eugenics 33:35— Pro-natalism and declining fertility rates 37:14— William Shockley 48:00— Shakespeare and The Beatles 57:22— Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and the gender dimensions of genius 1:03:50— Lewis' Jordan Peterson interview 1:07:18— Germaine Greer and second wave feminism 1:11:05— The gender debate in the UK vs US 1:14:14— Elon Musk's rise and fall? 1:20:57— Do geniuses have second acts? Upcoming events: This is an AI-generated, AI-edited transcript. Check all quotes against the audio for accuracy. Nick Gillespie: Helen Lewis, thanks so much for talking to Reason. Helen Lewis: Thank you for having me. Let's start with the obvious question. The book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, which is a great subtitle. But why did you write The Genius Myth? Do you know what, it's one of those things where it's evolved over time, so I may be now lying to myself about why I wrote it. But I did have a conversation with a friend a couple of years ago about the idea that—he has always said that genius is a right-wing concept, which I thought was a really interesting idea because it's about the individual over the collective. It's about people with sublime achievement who are not part of the common throng. And I thought that was interesting. I thought, well, I hear loads and loads of left-wing people use it very casually, and I don't think they're accepting this kind of idea behind it. And then that made me think, well, hang on a minute, what other ideas are kind of being smuggled in in that little word? And that's where the book kind of came from. That's fascinating. And it puts me in mind—the book is fantastic. I mean, it is a great read. It's better than 99 percent of novels I read. And I love—it's a series of stories about kind of crazy people and the people, including all of us, who enable them. But part of what you talk about in The Genius Myth is that being a genius meant radically different things in different eras. Explain in ancient Greece—and I don't know why we care about what ancient Greece thought about anything—but the Greeks talked about having genius, or being a genius meant that you were possessed with a visiting spirit. Can you explain what that means? Yeah, you have a genius—that's the original sense of it. You're visited by this spirit, and you know, it might be the muse of poetry speaks through you, or the muse of history. And they called it furor poeticus, furor divinus—divine fury. And I think that captures something really well. I don't know if you would describe yourself as a genius, Nick, but most of us wouldn't. But you must have had moments when you've sat down— No, very few people have defined me as a genius, so thank you. But you might have had times when you sit down to write a piece or do some piece of work, and it just clicks. Something just feels really good. And I think most writers probably spend most of their life kind of chasing that dragon for the rest of the time. You go, 'when will it come back?' And that's what writing should feel like, and most of the time it's just a kind of grind. So I think they did a very good thing then in capturing something that we've all felt to some extent. There are moments that work. You talk about how, particularly in the context of things like pop music and whatnot—and this is certainly true for writers and novelists in particular—you go on a streak where you are just performing at a higher level. I want to get into an argument about the Beatles for any number of reasons. It's independent of you—I have this argument every morning. But when you look at somebody like Paul McCartney, who you talk about in an interesting way, he's got to understand that whatever he's been doing for the past 40 years is not what he did for that 5- to 10-year period. He was on. So you go from that classical understanding of genius as a visiting spirit or something is speaking through you—which now is almost always the province of serial killers, right? I guess I had the dog talk to me, and it told me to kill me. They're the last classical geniuses in this tattered world. But then in the Renaissance things shift—the Renaissance and the early modern period. How does being a genius change in that period? Maybe even a little bit later than that, because the thing about the Renaissance is always that the word comes from rinascita—rebirth. So the idea was that they were, as they saw it, bringing back the classical tradition. And it was kind of quite imitative—you were trying to learn these things about proportion and form. Well, I don't want to get sidetracked. I'm just going to say yes—they were smuggling what they wanted to do by saying, "What we're really doing is merely bringing back these eras of former greatness." There's the American Renaissance in American literature, which was created in the 1940s about the pre–Civil War period. And I believe there's a racial journal now called American Renaissance, which—they want to rebirth things. So in this early modern period redefinition of genius, what's going on? Then you get this very, very important book that I had to say I didn't really know about, which is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. And it is a group biography of—I have to say, all the artists that I would have known growing up because they were also Ninja Turtles, like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. But there is a sense that that was a period of a kind of burst of creativity, and he puts them together in this kind of pantheon. And it's one of the first times that you begin to see, in a really systematic way—this is what I mean by the genius myth. These are stories that we tell about people who are innovators or scientists or artists. So you have, for example, the story of Leonardo da Vinci. And the myth that's imposed on him is that he couldn't settle on anything. He had a kind of—an uber level of ADHD. He was designing the helicopter, then he wanted to learn how to paint directly onto a wall using tempura, then he was doing something else. He was kind of a scatterbrain. We have all met that person in our first semester in college as well—who's just so brilliant. Obviously Leonardo accomplished a few things, as well. It's true—not all of the people that you meet in the first semester at college go on to paint the Mona Lisa, or anything like it, sadly. But what I was getting at is that the Mona Lisa wasn't really the Mona Lisa until centuries after it. Until it got stolen. This is one of my favorite things in all of it. It's the same way that Shakespeare died a respectable playwright, but he didn't die the guy that we should enthrone forever as the crowning jewel of English literature. That really a century later. And exactly the same thing with the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa was—and I'm going to be really rude here and say—quite a sludgy gray and green painting, and not seen as the crowning achievement of the Renaissance by any means. It gets stolen in the 1920s and ends up in Italy. And it becomes—actually, as lots of these things do—about national myths, because Leonardo was Italian or proto-Italian, but he was working for most of his life in France. So it becomes a kind of 'Who owns this great genius?' and 'Therefore, who should have the Mona Lisa?' And then it becomes a kind of inter-country fight. It's also great because, in the United States in particular, Italians have always claimed Christopher Columbus. But now many of us Italian Americans are like, "Oh, maybe he was working for Spain, and maybe he is a Jew, so forget it. We don't need Columbus anymore." He's not The Sopranos… But da Vinci is one model of a Renaissance genius. Talk about Michelangelo or some of the others. The person categorizing them said, "OK, well, there are different gradations." He seemed very much like a boy with a bunch of Pokémon dolls or something where he's rank ordering them things like that. Yeah, well, he definitely had a bias. He had a pro-Florentine bias. So he's quite rude about Titian, who was born—I think— Venice or the Alps. But he kind of gets relegated to second status because he's not from the right place. But Michelangelo, he uses as a different example, which is something you find all the time in genius myths: which is someone who had to struggle. So that's turned into a story about how hard it was to paint the Sistine Chapel, and how he had to design all the stuff you'll hear if you go on the tour of the Sistine Chapel. The other thing that you will know from visiting the Sistine Chapel is that it's a lot. It's quite—it is a statement, is it not? Yeah. And I think that's kind of fascinating too—that you have to have a level of ambition. The film critic called it white elephant art. Which he didn't intend as a compliment—these films that kind of announce themselves as a masterpiece. And I think that actually is also quite pertinent to this. The fact that Ulysses by James Joyce is very hard to read—not an enjoyable novel in the conventional sense—is actually taken as being a sign of its genius. The fact that the Sistine Chapel is big…if he'd done that much individual painting and separated it out by canvases, we wouldn't find it quite so impressive as this one—you know, what's that German word? Kunstkammerwerk—you know, the kind of the whole thing is it. You have that word written on your computer, and you use it in every conversation that you ever have. That's true. I do, actually. Yeah, you've rumbled me. But you know what I mean—like that idea of the kind of… You still see it now when you have like, oh, Birdman, it's filmed like it was in a single shot, or The Revenant, oh it only filmed in natural light, or Tom Hanks really lost all the weight for Cast Away, or Charlize Theron made herself ugly for Monster. These are kind of—there's a price to greatness. I like the movies where people gain weight, because anybody can lose weight, right? If we may jump forward a little bit—and I want to skip over him a little bit, both because he deserves to be forgotten, but I want to get to a later figure in Victorian England—but Thomas Carlyle pops up a couple of times in your work. And he is kind of the modern conceptualizer, right, of Great Man Theory, which is related to genius but it's not quite the same thing. Life writing takes form, and then you get the Industrial Revolution and capitalism. And what you then get is genius really as a marketing tool. So, if you're an artist in the 14th century, what you need is a rich aristocratic patron. If you're an artist in the 18th century, 19th century—well, actually, at this point there'd be things like, you know, gallerists start arriving, things like newspapers arrive, mass media arrives, and you might therefore be able to brand, basically. But what's interesting is that most of the time, or at least at that point, it seems to be less the person selling themselves as a genius, and they have a Boswell—or they have somebody around them who is writing them up as, like, "Oh, this is the real guy," like a hype man. A Flavor Flav. Yeah, everybody needs an 18th century Flavor Flav. Yes, it's true. But then you have somebody like Thomas Carlyle, who, you know, very much of a… in the context of his time, it's not like he was a right-winger. And he hated capitalism, certainly. And he hated all of the liberal economists who actually thought that Irish people and Blacks in Jamaica were human in the same way he was. But how does he talk about Great Man Theory, and how does that kind of add to the genius lore before it gets kind of quantified and mathematized later in that century? Yeah, he has this line, which I'm going to mangle, but it's something like, "The history of the world is, at root, only the history of great men." And that was very in keeping with a certain type of patrician Victorian thinking—that you just needed these once-in-a-generation personalities. One of their references would have been someone like Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French general. And I think there's a lot to that argument—that actually, the military decisions that Napoleon made at the times that he made them changed the history of Europe. He was a consequential figure. In the same way that now The Atlantic just ran a cover story on Donald Trump that said he's the most consequential president of the 21st century. I do think it's a reasonable point to say that some people are kind of hinge points in history. I was gonna make a joke about like, what's his competition so far though? You know, it's—zombie Abe or whatever. And you thought—"No, I love Obama and I would never say anything mean about him." Well, I know. I said, unfortunately, from my stupid libertarian point of view, I see an immense continuity between George W. Bush, Obama, Trump I, [Joe] Biden, Trump II. And it's not a good continuity. But, you know, this is part of what you're talking about when you talk about The Genius Myth—you're not saying everybody is exactly the same, and it's just a social construction that Leonardo gets called a great artist, but actually anybody around him was as good. But it is this storytelling and kind of creating this sense that these people are the limit of everything that we're doing. But with Carlyle—so Carlyle—I guess in a way systematic thinking— this is what the Enlightenment was about. And to some degree, the Renaissance—it hadn't quite got there. And you certainly get there with somebody like [Karl] Marx and [Freidrich] Engels, where they kind of say, actually it's the system. It's the base—typically the economic base—that actually determines everything else. So we might forgive Carlyle this one thing of not really understanding. Oh, I totally forgive him because, you know, what's the easiest thing to do is to go, "Actually, it's both," because it obviously is both, right? Some people do make decisions, but also they are products of fundamental forces that are in society. And I guess—now let me, because I outed myself on my libertarian podcast show as a libertarian—maybe it's people like Adam Smith who started to talk about how things don't just happen. There are a lot of kind of occult forces, invisible hands and whatnot, that create order among seeming chaos. And you could extend that to individuals. I feel like this is a big part of your life's work—the meta story that you tell now—which is just that it's a mix of both. It's circumstance and it's individual effort. And that should in no way ever be controversial, but it seems like it constantly needs to be relearned. Absolutely. Because you bring up Carlyle, and he was writing defensively. That's what I didn't really realize until I looked more at that stuff. I sort of assumed everybody in the Victorian era was swanning around going, "Of course the thing is that just a couple of men changed the world." But no—he was writing to defend that idea against what he saw as the kind of forces of egalitarianism. There's a fantastic book called How the Dismal Science Got Its Name by David Levy, which is a study mostly of how Carlyle and other people like him treated the Irish in popular culture and academic discourse basically in the long 19th century. And they were mad that people were saying, "No, actually the Irish are pretty much like the rest of us. They follow incentives. They're not all gorillas or chimpanzees." And that's why Carlyle named the dismal science "the dismal science," because he said that was its main truth—that all humans respond similarly to incentives. What a dismal science that we're not somehow more elevated than the lower order. That's great—to accidentally coin a really great phrase like that when you're trying to be rude. Yes, right. But the point I try to make in the book is that we always end up coming back to Great Man Theory—even people on the left—because we want stories. And stories demand protagonists. Frankly, your biography of Napoleon is going to sell a lot better than your book about agrarian upheaval in France in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's just more interesting to have… You know, when you write a screenplay, the first thing anyone will ever tell you is you have to have a protagonist and they have to be active—they have to make decisions. That's how our minds want history to kind of work. But there's a brilliant paper that I reference in the book from 1922, about "Are Inventions Inevitable?" And the list that they have of the number of things that got invented simultaneously—the most obvious one is the telephone, right? Two people came up with the telephone, and only one of them gets the credit. I write about Edison—Thomas Edison—later in the book. And everybody had the idea for the light bulb. Every man and his dog had that idea because it's quite a simple conceptual idea. What they couldn't do for 100 years was manufacture it and reliably make it work. And the real genius of Edison, if he had it, was, I think, the New York City power grid. But again, that's just not as compelling a story as "Man invents light bulb" that you can see and hold in your hand. And Edison, then—and you point out that he ended up in a fight that he lost. I mean, he lost a lot of his invention battles overall. He was a proponent of direct current, and alternating current won out and ultimately kind of swallowed a lot of his activity. And with Edison, I mean, there's always the fascinating concept of Edison versus Tesla. So you have Edison as one kind of genius, and then Tesla as another—crazy, more romantic genius, because he ended in failure. Do you know, my favorite anecdote is the fact that Tesla walked out of Edison's lab—where he worked for a while—because they had a bet, which Tesla won, and then Edison got really grumpy about him. And I just think this is fascinating because—I don't know if you know this—a couple of months ago, the podcaster Sam Harris told the story. He had a bet about deaths during the coronavirus pandemic with Elon Musk, and Sam Harris won. And then he said, "So, where's my—pay up, son?" And then Elon Musk kind of just got weird—kind of grumpy—and ended their friendship. I like that. That is a great way for Sam Harris to call himself a genius. —is to call himself Tesla. But it is also interesting that, in the book, I had already made this comparison between Edison and Elon Musk—both in the sense of the style of invention they do, their talent for publicity, but also the ego, frankly, that has made them want to play the public role of an inventor. And I think that's where the bet story really comes from. Neither of them likes to be beaten or humiliated. They were both schemers—not ivory tower scientists happy to do their own thing and let the chips fall where they may. They both want to be out there in the world selling themselves. And so that echo was very pleasing. Yeah. And we'll talk more about Musk at the end, I think—or toward the end of this conversation. But Edison also was—he really did work long hours, but he also did what Benjamin Franklin called "visible industry." Like, he made sure you knew. How did you know Edison worked 24 hours a day? Because he told you every time he saw you, or he had people in the press who were either sycophants or on his payroll or whatever, who were telling people. It's not clear that he ever said that creativity or genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration, but that captured the image that he was pushing. Oh yeah. I mean, I've got actually—I think more respect for Edison as a businessman and as a marketer than I had when I came in. But you're right, because everyone wanted the myth to be that they were kind of—you know, the easiest mark is somebody who wants to believe what you're selling them. And everybody wanted to believe that he was this American Prometheus. You know, he was stealing fire from the gods. And this is what I mean—to come back to nationalism again. This was a time in which America was the future. Europe was kind of classy, but it was old and hidebound and dying. And America was the new continent of steel and electricity and the railroad and these big barons. And Edison fit that image that America had of itself at that time. So he slotted himself in very neatly. There was a pre-made genius myth for him as an American genius. Right. And if I'm remembering, there was a fantastic series of kids books called Childhood of Famous Americans. All right. And it was the same story told over and over again, but they would change the names and places. And there was one of Edison, and part of his myth is that at some point he was working as a baggage boy on a railroad or something, and he was missing his train, and he gets pulled in by his ears—which caused hearing loss. So he became a great telegraph operator, and his kids were nicknamed Dot and Dash. But a lot of it came from: he was a small kid from nowhere who had bad hearing because of this industrial accident, and then he becomes the greatest inventor of all time. And he gets rewritten as well as "Tom" Edison—young Tom Edison, like Tom Sawyer—rather than his actual first name, which was Alva. And that again just speaks to the kind of— The country hasn't been invented yet that's going to promote an "Alva" as their great inventor. Yeah. And there's a famous movie called Young Tom Edison with, like, Jimmy Stewart or somebody playing him. So this gets done again and again. But now let's bring it back to the evil effects of the British on public discourse, and let's talk about Francis Galton. Because what is interesting—you have the geniuses themselves who become public either because somebody writes about them or they're creating their own myth. But then you have somebody like Francis Galton, who helped kind of quantify—or tried to quantify—what genius meant, and also why it's hereditary and why it persists in certain types of people but not others. Explain who Francis Galton is. He was a really brilliant dilettante—from the time when you could just skip around and come up with lots of different things. He tried to create a beauty map of the British Isles and work out where the women were hottest. I mean, very much actually the precursor of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook in that respect. But was he a lifelong bachelor? He definitely was childless, right? He married, yes, but I can't detect any real enthusiasm for women—or, indeed, any other people at all. Did he marry—did he fight? Like, he was like, "The Orkney Islands have the hottest babes, so I'm going there," or something? No, I think it was—I think it was an arranged marriage. There's a bit in his memoir of his essentially like gap year, where he goes to Africa. One of the chieftains offers him a woman as a "temporary wife," and he declines because she's covered in— that orange pigment, and he doesn't want to get it on his white linen suit. And it's just the sort of most Englishman-abroad kind of colonial power. That's pretty amazing.You have a lot to be ashamed of. OK, thank you. I'll take that one actually. He was also the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. He came from this very storied family in the 19th century, and he therefore was familiar with the idea of evolution by natural selection. You know, this was the idea that survival of the fittest—that people passed down something that now we think of in terms of genes. They didn't have that kind of biological basis to it initially. But he was very interested to think, well, hang on a minute—you can breed dogs in all these different ways. You can breed cattle. Maybe we could breed humans. And this is what I mean about him not showing really any kind of… It just doesn't make sense… Right. Him not showing any kind of fellow feeling for other humans. It was like, "Where could this possibly go wrong? I'm sure this won't have any bad consequences whatsoever." And of course, it did, right? Because he coined the term eugenics, which is from "good birth," essentially, and then dysgenics—which you hear a bit about today. He wrote this book called Hereditary Genius, in which he tried to work out how frequently genius and high achievement occurred in the population and how it was passed down. And people were kind of slagging it off from the very beginning. There's a great dunk of it from a Victorian writer at the time—because he works out that there's a whole family of judges, and he essentially posits the existence of a kind of hereditary judginess. And someone else calls them a "snug little galaxy of jobbers," which I think is right. Just the idea that actually, if you're a judge and your nephew wants to be a judge, then there may be other ways by which that happens rather than pure genetic inheritance. But that's a very influential book among a whole generation of statisticians, because he was a brilliant statistician. And they were also heavily influenced by eugenics. Can I ask was he actually a brilliant statistician, or was he just really novel in what he applied statistics to? Like, he measured a lot of stuff and then said, "OK, well, it means this," but. I mean, the question is— —have concepts like standard deviation, correlation, things like that—they come from his thinking and his work. So he's there right at the birth of this discipline as an academic one. So I think you can say that he was brilliant. And to go back to the idea of, like, do individuals create inventions or do larger forces produce them—is he, as England is moving out—or as the modern world, certainly Europe, is moving out—of kind of inherited aristocracy, he provides a rationale for why the ruling class deserves to be. And this is more of a Marxist kind of interpretation, but it's that Victorian England had to produce Francis Galton, because otherwise people would be like, "Why am I listening to these people simply because they, when I was born, had more money than me?" Yeah, I think that's very true. And also, he provides an excellent justification for imperialism, which was also a great enthusiasm of England at the end of the 19th— He didn't create it. But then provides a justification for what's happening anyway. Which, yeah, in a lot of social theory—that probably, well, now that I'm thinking about it, might be a better interpretation of a lot of social theory—that it's not leading where society goes, but it's rather kind of explaining why we're doing what we're already doing. Yeah, I think you can say there was a kind of Francis Galton–shaped hole in the discourse, and he popped into it quite neatly to say, "Europeans are of better racial stock than Africans," right? And that was obviously something that white Europeans were very keen to hear at the end of the 19th century. Well, some of them, right? Because it really took a couple more generations to figure out, "OK, well, which…who are the Europeans who are actually European, as opposed to Africa due north?" I mean, by the end of the 19th century, you had people who were like, "Well, the Nordics and the Alpines are OK, but these Mediterraneans, like, nah—they're not really…" Well, that's where we have to flick it over to the Americans really taking up the mantle on that. Because they just went, "Hang on a minute. Polish people aren't quite European. Italian people aren't quite European. Irish people aren't quite European. We mean the Nordics, right?" And that's how our racial laws are going to say that the true descendants of the ancient Greeks, bizarrely. I don't know why the ancient Greeks got away scot-free, despite being from Southern Europe, as being very intelligent. If they were so good, they wouldn't have gone away. I mean, this is what I just—I don't understand. But yeah, you're right. He just becomes a very influential figure in what then develops into eugenics and race science. His name has recently been taken off a lot of buildings at University College London. And it's one of those ones where I think I'm ok with it. You know, I think there are lots of cases for whether—- went too far… Am I remembering correctly—part of his research method was measuring the column inches or the number of mentions in encyclopedias of famous people to kind of— He did obituaries, yeah. And then Havelock Ellis, who was a sexologist, does another book in which he basically gets out a ruler. And this is the problem that always happens with these people—they get completely stuffed by Shakespeare, about whom we know very little, and Jane Austen, who lived a very quiet, boring, blameless life in a parsonage. So the biographical idea that you just—you have a lot of biographical detail and you get written about a lot—completely falters. And then they just end up fudging these supposedly scientific lists. Which is the methodology that Charles Murray used in his book Human Accomplishment, where he looked at reference works and measured column inches. Which I think probably calls more for a Freudian interpretation rather than a mathematical interpretation of what's going on. Right. I think you can say it's all interesting data, but it's not objective scientific data. Because you can measure how someone's reputation has changed over time, but you can't say there's a kind of version of just desserts where the most intelligent people get the most column inches. I think our own media at the moment would heavily debunk that idea. Talk about eugenics briefly, because we're also—and this is in the Muskosphere and Peter Thielosphere and stuff like that—where people are talking about eugenics. It's one thing if you're saying the state is running things and saying, "You can mate with these people but not those people," and things like that. You know, when you are going to Burning Man or you're at the Bohemian Grove and it's a voluntary association, we all are eugenicists. We all practice some form of "good birth," where we choose these people rather than those people. Is there a way to disentangle eugenics from its kind of history? Is there a eugenics which does not immediately—or quickly—devolve into racial sorting and some kind of horrific cataclysm of human suffering? In practice, I think, no. I think in theory, you're right—it doesn't have to go in those directions. And I think actually—again, I think you're kind of alluding to this—most people, when you drill down to it, are softly eugenicists themselves. Most people: A, they choose their partner because they think their partner is attractive and smart and would be a good father or mother—which is itself kind of eugenics. The second thing is that most people are broadly supportive of women having abortions of babies with severe and life-limiting illnesses—even those like Down syndrome that aren't necessarily fatal. So, lots of people think that looking after a disabled kid would be really hard, and people should have the choice to opt out of that. I have this argument with one of my friends, who has written brilliant books about eugenics. And I said, "But that is eugenic." And you just don't want to call it eugenics because, to you, eugenicism is bad. But you support this. And I think that's what I mean about in practice, I think there are things that people do agree with that you could describe as eugenic. But in any kind of organized movement, it is so unbelievably tainted by what happened in California in the '30s—huge amounts of sterilizations of the quote-unquote "feeble-minded"— by what had happened under the Nazis, that no reputable scientist would touch it with a 10-foot bargepole. And I don't really see the need to rehabilitate it in these individual cases. Do you see any—I realize it's a little bit off topic—but we are now, because there is a demographic collapse happening. It's women's fault. Women are having fewer children now that they have more job opportunities. Right, because they're grasshoppers, and they reproduce by themselves. Yeah, it's women's fault, yeah. But throughout the West—certainly in the U.S., but then especially in those old parts of Europe that maybe really aren't European, places like Hungary—there's a big push for natalism. The state needs to pump up the volume of kids being born. And countries like Singapore spend millions—or billions—of dollars a year trying to do that. Is that a form of eugenics as well? Should we be concerned, from a history-of-eugenics point of view, about what happens when the state starts to say, "You need to be having more kids"? I think the main contradiction to that is that we don't have any evidence that it works. Stalin had a medal that was like—if you had 10 kids, you got a medal. Yeah, I think it was six or something, but yeah. I mean, to me, what I consider to be a lot of children. And there have been regimes through history that have tried to—currently, Viktor Orbán in Hungary said very explicitly, "I don't want more immigrants. I want more Hungarians." And he has put in tax breaks for people who have more than three children, reductions on the people carrier, you know. But with negligible effects, from what I can see. Unless you're running a really brutally directive society like China, where you can dictate to people how many kids they have— And that it was more about having fewer. But now it's like, "Please, please, can you—people—start having children again? We've realized this is a demographic problem." And I think that will be harder to reverse than the previous one-child policy. That's the thing that's interesting. And I think actually—oh, I've forgotten her name, the brilliant researcher Alice—and I've just talked to Ross Douthat about this at The New York Times—that actually it's not even just the West. Quite conservative societies in North Africa are also seeing this reduction in birth rates. No, it tracks perfectly with the proxy that I've seen brooded about a lot is the number of years of education women have on average. As that increases, fertility rates decline—always and everywhere. And it's that the world has become more modern, meaning that women have more opportunity and more equality and more education. I know Mexican women in Mexico have more kids than they do in America. They cross the border, and they have fewer kids. And that's not even that big a difference. But everywhere, yeah—it's a global phenomenon. And I think it contributes as a sign of progress, actually. Because it means more people, I think, are making more choices. I think it's a sign of progress. I think it's very hard to square with our current gerontocracies in terms of our political systems. I mean, that's the problem. In Britain having fewer working-age people to support more older people is a problem, when those older people are on unsustainably high pensions and earlier retirement… You know, I have a political ideology of limited government and a basic social safety welfare net that I would love to sell to you right now. The problem isn't that people are getting older; it's that we have unsustainable entitlement programs that we can thank Bismarck for. Oh, right. OK. Yeah, OK—so we've put, so far, the villains of today's podcast as the English and Otto von Bismarck. OK, good to have the enemies list updated. Come on, surely let's argue about the Beatles now, Nick. You've been holding out on me. Yeah, well, before we get to them, I want to talk about William Shockley, who is somebody that I think a fair number of my audience will remember. He encapsulates something perfect—partly because he is related, he's a kind of semi-direct descendant intellectually of Galton. But he is also fantastic because he brings us closer to Silicon Valley. William Shockley won a Nobel Prize for his role—contested as it may be—in developing the transistor. And then he became a—you know, he took that— He was a massive prick. And everybody left his firm, and they went on to found Silicon Valley. That's the short way. That's right. On the business end, he had this great creation, or he was part of a great invention, and then he was such a terrible manager that everybody who worked for him—who were incredibly talented—were like, "Fuck it, we're going to start our own company." And that became modern Silicon Valley. And then he spent the rest of his life, "electronics, who cares, I want to talk about racial differences that are quantifiable." And he is the genius, in a way, who precedes many other figures that we'll talk about, but where he was great at one thing, and then spent most of his time talking about stuff—that is just crazy pants—and it takes away from his luster as a great inventor. Yeah, I was just rereading the interview that he did with Playboy. It was one of those kind of great heyday-of-Playboy, nine-billion-page interviews. And it's just—it's really sad to see somebody who obviously had a great scientific brain, but they've just picked up a load of goo, basically. Like, for example, he didn't—you know, the interviewer talks to him about his decision to donate to the so-called Genius Sperm Bank, which is a kind of cursed idea from the start. But he has no idea that men's sperm degrades with age and that at 70, the old swimmers might not be in the best condition. And he just completely hasn't looked into that. And it's a kind of sad version of someone who obviously had a great and flexible intellect in their youth, and they've just kind of hardened. And I don't know about you, but when I was reading that, it felt like one of those kind of internet–social media–era midlife crises ahead of its time. I'm sure the obvious example is Naomi Klein's book about Naomi Wolf, a great feminist scholar, gets caught out and then drifts into the kind of QAnon sphere Wolf found out on—was it the BBC? Live on radio. She basically had a book that was about gay men. And she said that there were a number of them who were executed for sodomy. And it turned out that the phrase that had been written was "death recorded." And that didn't mean they'd been executed. That meant that they'd had a death sentence and actually most of them had ended up commuted or whatever. But it was just this very embarrassing thing that dented her credibility in the liberal sphere. So she went over to the other side. And here is—I'm going to make—this is an act of genius that I almost certainly won't pull off, because I'm not a genius. But that moment where she is live talking to the interviewer who points that out to her, and she's like, "Oh… oh." I mean, you just see something change. It's almost like having a stroke. It's very similar to the moment—and I believe you mention this in the book—the Peter Jackson documentary about the Beatles, Get Back, when the song "Get Back" comes into recognizable form. Where the Fab Four are noodling around, and then suddenly you hear this classic song come into being. Yeah, it's a live-action shot of somebody who basically—and I think this is exactly what happened to Shockley. Shockley won his Nobel Prize, the career stalled, he couldn't understand what happened to it. He made, I think, one idle comment about IQ and everyone screamed at him. And he did exactly what happens to lots of people now in that situation, where he felt like that was unfair and unjust, and so he kind of did it harder. And he became a provocateur, and he got into this mindset of, "The more that I'm owning the libs, the righter I must be." And I think you just—you see that. I still think you see that now, and I understand it psychologically. Yeah, like you say, "I'm this thing that you know is horrible, and it's like I'm going to be your worst nightmare version." And in the point about Shockley—and this is, I mean, a credit to the book and to your work—is that Shockley was not— here was an ongoing study of IQ and super-smart kids in California that he did not make the cut for. So you have a guy who becomes obsessed with IQ as this thing that is free-floating and independent from all sorts of influences. And you have to—I mean, anybody reading that in the contemporary world would say, "Oh, he became obsessed with IQ because he was a genius, but he was not ratified as a genius in this grammar school or high school study going on in California." I found that very telling. Yeah, that's Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of the Gifted, and the cutoff point was either 140 or 135 on this particular IQ score. And he claims that his mother got an IQ score of 150, but he was below it. And actually, there was one other Nobel Prize winner, Luis Alvarez, who also didn't make the cut. And the really sad thing is, in that Playboy interview, he says, "Well, you know, I think probably my IQ has gone up a bit since then," which isn't really how it works between being a school kid and being 70, right? But obviously—you can—yeah, I think you're exactly right. When I read that, I thought, oh, there's the chip on the shoulder. That actually, he's had all the success—what more success could you want than having a Nobel Prize if you're in the sciences? But somehow, there's some little bit of him that still feels he's not enough. And actually, if he clings to this idea of superiority through IQ—racial superiority through IQ—that rubs a little bit of salve on that chip. What goes into people who—and I want to get to the Beatles, because I can talk about The Beatles endlessly. And I met Paul McCartney once— Oh, wow! Yeah, as a college kid. So it was quite exciting, and it led to one of the reasons that I no longer like The Beatles so much. Oh, ok? So that's a good tease, right? But to focus on Shockley a little bit—what goes on where you are a genius in this field or this set of fields—manufacturing, science, invention, electricity—and then you say, "Well, fuck it. What I really want to talk about is race and IQ"? You mentioned, like, his career seemed to stall because nobody—literally nobody—wanted to work with him. They were like, "I'm leaving. You cannot lock me in this factory anymore. I'm just going." But how does that happen? Because this is part of what the book is about. We're in a golden age now where if you are really good at making money on Wall Street, or if you are really good at inventing an electric car, if you are really good at making pop music, we really want to hear your thoughts about all of these other fields that you know absolutely nothing fucking about. I know. It's strange, isn't it? I think, yeah, that does seem to me the Shockley story. There is a heavy suggestion that he kind of piggybacked on the precise version of the transistor that won the Nobel Prize—it was really other people's work—and that people in the lab got tired of him being a kind of credit hog. And then he started getting into applying psychometric testing to his employees, which is always a red flag, I would say. If I may—I've never had to take a psychometric job test, or one that presented itself as such, but my father worked for a shipping company and he used to tell this story that I found very funny. It was called Sea-Land, and it kind of popularized containerized shipping in the postwar era. But it was founded by a guy named Malcolm McLean, who was an illiterate son of sharecroppers in North Carolina. And then, at a certain point, when the company got big enough, they were like, "OK, you've got to start taking business seriously." And they had all of the employees take kind of basic IQ tests to see if they were Sea-Land–worthy people. And Malcolm McLean failed it—because he was basically illiterate, and he was not functioning at the higher level. But, you know—so you had this moment in the heyday of scientific management, where a guy who revolutionized shipping would not be hired at his own company because he was kind of retarded. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, so I always— It doesn't surprise me, because I think that, you know, you would always want to have a higher IQ than not. But I think people overrate that—when you're getting way above the average—how important it is versus personality traits like conscientiousness, openness to experience, whatever it might be. So I think I'm entirely unsurprised by that, but your question kind of speaks to one of the things I talk about in the book, which is this idea of galaxy brainlessness. Which is the idea that, "I'm a smart person, all my opinions are smart." And I think it's just demonstrably not true. And the other thing is—I think it's really sad for the geniuses themselves. Because you look at someone like Shockley, and he has his success because his type of intelligence and his breakthroughs interact with a particularly fertile moment in the history of Silicon Valley, right? He had the right brain for the right time. And what often happens to people is that that lasts for a while, and then it goes away. And that is a really traumatic process for them—particularly if they've become kind of high on their own supply, and they believe that they're a superior sort of person. You know, "Why—I'm pressing the gas pedal and the car's not moving forward anymore," and they can't understand it. And that does often, I think, lead people to kind of bitterness and resentment rather than a kind of appreciation of, "Most people don't get one hot streak. Maybe I won't get two, but the one I had was pretty good." So this is a good segue to talk about The Beatles and the music or creativity streaks where either you're hot, and then suddenly you're not. And I guess part of—we have been, I don't know, and I'm assuming broad social trends in Britain are similar to America—but certainly over the past 30 or 40 years, we have been pushing galaxy brain ideas on schoolchildren and things like that. You know, the idea that you have a domain-specific genius or intelligence doesn't seem to be in favor. We talk about general intelligence, and it's kind of like if you're good at one thing, you're going to be good at everything. So—I mean, we're kind of reaping that whirlwind. I'm not even sure I'm using that term properly, but—because people like Elon Musk are told when they're a kid, "Well, you are really smart. You do great on standardized tests, so everything you say—you get an A in every subject." So like, why wouldn't you start talking about fertility or something like that? So let's talk about the Beatles a bit. How did The Beatles—I mean, it's fascinating, you know, Shakespeare and The Beatles are like the two great British exports, right? Yeah, yeah. And I really appreciate your focus on the way that all of this stuff plays into national myth-making and things like that. When you talk to French or German people, they're like, "Yeah, Shakespeare's pretty good, but he's not great." English-speaking people—and Americans, I think, probably love Shakespeare more than English people—because we have spent, you know, a couple hundred years trying to be like, "No, Melville—he's as good, and Walt Whitman." During graduate school, I studied American literature, and it was fascinating—right around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and then the Soviet Union collapsed. And suddenly, Americanists who had been spending 50 years searching for the American Shakespeare were finally like, "Hey, you know what? We don't actually have to worry. Britain is now a minor literature because America is—our literature matters because we're the world power. We don't have anything to apologize for on some level." But roundabout way of getting to the Beatles—like, you particularly talk about how, within the Beatles mythology, John is seen as the kind of genius, and Paul is—you know, he's like the job, right? He's just a hard worker. What goes into that, and why do you pick Paul over John? Well, for a start, I say this slightly incendiary line, which is: I think in terms of their long-term reputation, we're very lucky that it's Paul who's made it to 80, and John is now a hallowed memory. Because I think if John were still around, he'd be an extremely grumpy reactionary—probably doing quite bad tweets. That would be glorious, though. Whereas Paul McCartney has grown into that kind of father-of-the-nation role, and the younger musicians can make pilgrimage to him. Oh, and it's interesting—I'm sorry to interrupt—but I know George Harrison, who's also important in this kind of holy trinity. And you realize, as age goes on, that Ringo is the only Beatle really worth caring about in the long run. But— Ringo is lovely in Get Back, right? One of my friends described him as being like this sort of lovely Labrador. He's actually like a sort of emotional support animal—because he's there, just exuding Ringo energy. He calms everything down because people don't want to have a row in front of Ringo. And they don't want to upset Ringo. And actually, that is an underrated skill in the high crucible of tempestuous creative motion. Well, but George—towards the end of his life, by the '90s—he was grumpy. When Oasis openly paid a compliment to him by talking about "Wonderwall," which is a reference to his first—or near first—solo album, he was like, "Oasis sucks." He hated everybody younger than him. He was grouchy and grumpy. I mean, Oasis's reputation has not stood the test of time, has it, as a… No, I don't think so. They were— They had a lot of concerts. I think that might be an interesting one to see when people have their own music. Well, and they have their own—that's a variation, right, on the genius theme. The brother who writes everything is really the genius. I mean, they're doing the version of The Kinks with Ray Davies and Dave— Right. And two people who hate each other because they've both got something the other hasn't, right? Liam hates Noel for being able to write songs. And Noel hates Liam for being the charismatic frontman. Anyway, but there's a similar version of that with John and Paul, where John is cast in the role of being the rock bad boy. And that's what people kind of want at the time from their singers. Whereas Paul is seen as kind of domestic and managerial and a bit of a boring admin guy. And his songs focus on mundane stuff, whereas John is writing much more surreal and whimsical stuff—and that's seen as more creative. So you see by the end of the breakup that they've been put into those two categories, and that John has got the much more flattering one. But I don't think it would necessarily— —from a kind of romantic demonic—you know, like the Romantics loving Satan. John is that kind of rock creative genius. Yeah, exactly. Untamable, weird, odd. You know, him and Yoko were kind of wandering around filming their bottoms and all that kind of stuff. He's performing a much more obvious genius role. Whereas Paul McCartney has gone to live on a Scottish island, and send his kids to a public school, and wanting to be, quote, "as normal," right? Trying to live as normal a life as a rock star could live. And therefore—one of the things—I was just talking to a playwright last week about the book. And I said, the thing is, people would rate you as more talented if you were just weirder. You're too normal. You should try and cultivate an aura of eccentricity, because people would misread it as brilliance. I want to get to two other points before we stop talking. And I guess the first is: it's called The Genius Myth. Part of it—I can hear people being like, "Oh, you're just putting down anybody who accomplishes things. You are cutting down the tall poppy or whatever." The Canadian band Rush has a great song called "The Trees," which is about how all the maple trees are trying to keep this oak from growing taller than them. And, you know, they were in an Ayn Rand phase when they produced that. The maple leaf must be the regular Canadian, and they just don't want, you know, Rush to become too big. But it's about the myth, you know. How did you become interested in not the things that people do that are interesting, but in the way that it ends up being talked about? I think people in groups are completely fascinating. Because—I don't know about you—but I find it hard enough to understand individual people. The fact that they think in completely different ways to me. And just—things that to me are completely obvious, they just disagree with me on. And it's kind of life's project to be like, "Oh—other people's brains are different." But then you add in the complexity of them being in crowds, and it becomes completely impossible to understand why people do the things that they do. So lots and lots of my writing—about political movements, about social change—focuses on exactly those kinds of weird emergent properties of people in groups. And that's what interested me about this: you don't get to declare yourself a genius. You can try, right? Lots of people have. And quite a lot of them have been cruelly rebuffed. But genius is created by a crowd looking at you and adoring you and hailing you. And therefore, the interesting question is not just to talk about the properties of the people who are being adored, but the properties of the crowd. So I'm always really interested in celebrity—- Yeah, you talk about Elon Musk in the beginning of the book as an argument about what society values, but also what we're willing to tolerate because it's this whole pact. How did we get to a point where we're going to say—and this is an older example—but it's like, "Well, Roman Polanski deserves to fuck any child that he wants because he made Chinatown." I mean, generally, that is the way that people used to talk about it. They used to say that it was— That's how Bernard-Henri Lévy, the great human rights advocate, said it when Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and was going to be deported to the U.S. Yeah, or like, "It's not rape rape," or, you know, all these kind of weaselly things. Or, "It was Philistines"—that's what one French actress said: "You're Philistine," and then this campaign of smearing against him. And you're like, I'm going to stay at this wild position that I don't think it's good to drug and sexually assault teenagers. Just call me a prude, if you will. And to confess to that. He pled guilty and then he fled because he was worried that the plea bargain that was in place might not come through on the terms that he wanted. To talk about the kind of people who helped create the myth—you have a great chapter, and I'm misreading the title because I don't have it, but it's about the widow of the genius. You talk about people like Orwell's wife, but I'm especially interested in talking about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, who was an artist—plausibly of equal talent, potentially—but she kind of consciously, ultimately played a role of saying, "OK, I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to kind of build up his myth." Can you talk a little bit about that? And also, one of the things that I find fascinating—this is about your work in general—but it's particularly strong in this book— the gender dimension to all of this. Because geniuses—when you think of a genius, you think of a boy genius. You don't think of a girl genius. Oh, the Romantics were quite explicit about this. They thought genius was a male property, but it was a man who had a kind of feminine spirit within him. You know, this was the idea of a poet. But they're not girls. No. It was fae, sort of feminine men—but never butch ladies. No, that was not the same at all. So those roots of the gendering of genius are really, really deep. And I think there's pretty good research that says we're more likely to describe boys as brilliant. That is just an adjective that we apply more readily to men than to women. But is that something relatively recent? And then it becomes hard because in terms of, if we're talking about harder-core patriarchal structures…I had a conversation with Richard Dawkins once where he was talking about various things, and I was just like, "Yeah, it's really weird to me that, like, girls—you look back in human history and girls just couldn't pole vault until about 1985. Is that because of biology?" I grew up in a world, in high school, where girls were not allowed to participate in the pole vault because they couldn't do it. Evolution did not allow them to have the upper body strength to pole vault. How many times do you recognize things that are treated as facts of nature are obviously social constructions and change? And I'm not denying differences between men and women— Oh sure. No, I'm sure women are worse at pole vaulting, right? They do not do as well. It's definitely sex-linked. What I'm getting at is the question of girl and boy geniuses—because we now live in an age where, you know, the equality of sex is certainly under the law. And even in places where testing is used, you know, girls do better in high school, girls get into college more often, they graduate college more often. Are we going to look forward to a future of girl geniuses that are as insufferable as the boy ones? Well, that's the final dream of feminism, isn't it? To be as insufferable as men. Yeah, I don't know—because I think that's a really interesting question. There are undoubtedly women who have really high achievement in ways that they were previously blocked out of. But there's still an open question about whether or not there are sex differences in the kind of selfishness and ambition that's required to be like a William Shockley. Actually—are these traits that we really want to encourage in our children? The kinds of things that make you the Nobel-winning scientist? Or—that's also an interesting question about the fact that science has changed so much. There's very little low-hanging fruit that one person can now do. Most great science projects now are deeply collaborative—often across countries. But it's also about who the crowd wants to hold up as the genius. And I still think that both men and women are more reluctant to idolize women. So I don't think it necessarily will level out, actually. Because again, it's not an objective awarding of a quality—it's not something awarded on merit. It's about why you are celebrating someone—because of what it says about you, or what it says about the qualities you want to stress. So, you know, we definitely do have more women who are celebrated now. And also—the other thing I would say about, to go back to Lee Krasner—my editor made a very good note in that chapter which I incorporated. She has been the benefit of a explicitly feminist genius myth. Which is that feminist historians love the idea of finding overlooked women and lifting them up and celebrating them. You see that with Artemisia Gentileschi, the Renaissance painter. You see it with Krasner. And so there are a new set of genius myths, which are sometimes in themselves quite reductive—the poor, downtrodden woman who never got her flowers during her life, and now we're here, as the historical court of appeal, to make that right. So yeah, there will be some women who benefit from that. But I would doubt that it will level out anytime soon. What kind of pushback do you face when you bring up the social context of the creation of things like genius? Part of what your book is that there's a line or chapter like, "There really is no lightbulb moment." That Edison, tried a million different things, and all these people, etc. But you—for you—you certainly burst into a bigger view when, it was in 2018, when you had that great interview with Jordan Peterson. Yeah, what I like to do is confuse people by getting attacked from a completely different political tendency every couple of years and just switching it up. So, you know, there are people who've spent the last couple of years thinking that I'm this anti-woke conservative. And now I'm going to go through a phase where they think—I think you're right. The people who don't read the book will think this is some misguided egalitarian feminist nonsense that says, "Everybody can be Monet. Everybody can be Einstein. Everybody can be Picasso," or whatever it might be. So yeah, I think that there will be misreadings like that. You can only write the book. You can't force people to read it, tragically. It's a better world where authors cannot force people to read— I was going to say I couldn't read his book, but yeah. Well, he could get you to hold it up, right? And I guess Gaddafi did that too, right? He had his little Green Book—that's all over. I'm sure it's still in the basements of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi or whatever. But, you know, with that Jordan Peterson interview—what is amazing, like, when it came out, I watched it, and I was like, "OK, this is really—it's just great journalism." I mean, to your credit—what was funny to me, and more clear on a second viewing—is just that you're asking basic questions. And he is a male genius, and he uses ratiocination, he is incredibly learned—but it's like he's about to cry half the time. He is so emotional. Do you think we've entered into a period where men—the kind of male recourse to anger—is now being recognized less as, you know, genius and more as a failure to cope with what's going on in the circumstance? I hope that's true, because I know what you mean—particularly the kind of plethora of those very cruel videos of people having public meltdowns. I think you often see men melting down in public in a way that suggests they've just never learned to process and manage feelings of humiliation or denial, in a way that's quite unhealthy. And I think everybody would probably benefit from working a bit harder on that. But I'm pleased that you picked that up, because I do think it was very funny—because, you know, that was explicitly set up, that interview with Peterson— This was like—if I may make an analogy—this is like when Playboy sent a Black interviewer to General William Shockley. Sending GQ—sending a woman—to interview Jordan Peterson. For their Men of the Year issue. And that's the thing that's very funny, because everybody wanted it to be me—this kind of emotional little lady—and him to be the Great Man of Science loftily delivering his insights. But as you say, I'm there being quite sarcastic, because that's how I brawl. And he's the one who's kind of tearing up. It was actually very gender-nonconforming in that sense. So credit to everyone involved there. He fits into this category. He obviously toiled in the groves in the academy for a long time and had developed a certain kind of expertise and a certain level of reputation. And then when he broke big, now he's giving people tips on how to tie their tie and things like that. Yeah. I was talking to someone who knew him, actually, in Toronto earlier this week. And they said, you know, he was—he was this really great. Like, the research was really good, and the teaching was really good, and his students really liked him. Everybody who knows him from that period in his life is like, "Oh, you were a really great psychology professor, but you are probably not psychologically suited to be an internet commentator." Some people just have hides of inch-thick leather and that sort of thing bounces off of them. But clearly he's somebody who really takes criticism to heart, and it affects him quite deeply. And he's really not cut out for sprawling with people on the internet. Can I ask before—and I promise we'll get to Musk and then I'll let you get on with your day, or tea, or whatever you people are doing in England now—curtsying— —my crumpets —as you drive by… In your previous book Difficult Women, which is excellent—I'm a big fan of kind of second-wave feminism, which now gets read out of context. You read women like Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, and they're read out of context. Obviously, she shouldn't have shot Andy Warhol. She should have shot Norman Mailer if she understood her own theory. That would've been great. But what I'm saying is, second-wave feminism from the late '60s and early '70s often gets read in a void. So it just seems like these shrieking harpies who are talking about castrating men, etc., and it's always taken out of context. Like, yeah, they were denied entry into universities or jobs, etc. One of the figures you've talked about a fair amount is Germaine Greer. Talking about Norman Mailer—I mean, if you ever watch the live debate, she just rocks. She throws her fox fur stole over her shoulder and starts talking about building cathedrals in this über-academic way. I mean, it's… oh, I love it. Yeah. No—I mean, you could power all the energy needs of the developing world with the sexual tension… It is really quite something. Germaine Greer, does she fall into a problem of—she was hot, she had a moment. Do you think her thought isn't on a hot streak anymore? It's kind of a amazing because she helped define, certainly in England, second-wave feminism, and now she seems to be hated by most feminists. How does genius age? Oh, I don't think that's true in Britain, where she lived most of all—I mean, she's originally Australian. I think because of the transgender revolt of the last 10 years, she became very unfashionable with the people who came of age at that time. She was seen as being insufficiently inclusive of transgender women. But I think in Britain, the scales have tipped back toward—whatever you want to call it—sex realism, gender-critical feminism. People are now also rediscovering their love of Germaine Greer's brutal, radical honesty, I think we might call it. Personally, my favorite Germaine is not "Why I think naked boys are attractive" Germaine—that was a strange Germaine—nor even the Germaine of The Whole Woman or The Female Eunuch. But her writing on art criticism—she wrote a book about female painters called The Obstacle Race, which I read when I was revising this. As a scholar I think she's got another one called something like Kissing the Rod, which is about Restoration poetry. It's a very Germaine Greer title. She was an exceptional close reader of texts and paintings. And I wonder, actually, when the outrage about her comparing trans women to spaniels has all died down—we will remember the quality of her thoughts. In the same way that people now appreciate—you mentioned Valerie Solanas, but I'm thinking more of Andrea Dworkin. Penguin has just reissued all of Andrea Dworkin's work. Because it's now been long enough that people have kind of gotten over themselves about her controversies and remembered the interesting contributions that she made. But this comes exactly to what the whole book is about, which is: all of that depends on a generation of women—my age or below—who want to remember her, who want to keep enshrining her. This idea of history as a process—you know, we want to keep her memory and what she wrote alive. That's ultimately where the historical judgment comes from. It's whether or not the next generation thinks you're important. It seems to me that Britain has more—you know, and I use this term with air quotes—"TERFs" than American feminism. I think America maybe has a lot of… If you want to define it like this—80 percent of America thinks that sex matters and that there is a difference between trans women and women. Right? But those are none of— Yeah—none of that implies a different legal standing or anything like that. I have struggled. There's a tradition of French feminism, which is its own thing, and then Anglo-American feminism. I found it interesting, I guess, that there are very few American feminists who are on a Germaine Greer level—who exist and are talking publicly about this. Do you have a quick gloss on why it seems like second-wave feminism stuck around longer in England than it did in America? I think it's probably because of the trade union movement and the left feminist movement. Whereas in America, things became much more polarized. And also I think that in America, because abortion dominated the conversation for so long—and continues to dominate it—everybody gets sucked into that. There isn't a lot of space for other stuff. Plus, stuff like employment law being so much more federal in America—what are the kind of big…? And again, in America, race has been such a big part of the conversation for so much longer. I mean, Britain is now a much more diverse country than it was. But in the '90s, it was still 95 percent white. These are just much more recent questions about whether or not feminism is, quote, "white." In 1920, that wasn't a question in British feminism because everybody was white. Whereas it was a huge deal in America. So I think all of those social factors might account for it. I was just thinking as you were talking about England being blessedly white even into the 1990s. Whoa, whoa, whoa—I didn't say that! I was going to say—if you're looking for supplementary material for the eventual paperback edition of this, it would be great to look at Eric Clapton as a genius who then went on to a bit of racial… Very Shockley. A very Shockley trajectory. Like, "Oh, so you loved 'Layla'? Would you also like to hear my thoughts on race?" No—just play "Layla" again. That was really great. And he also has a few thoughts on COVID. I'm sure John Lennon would have had his few thoughts on COVID, I'm just saying. Well, yeah. This is where I think John Lydon—or Johnny Rotten—is kind of… he's a very stable genius, because whatever is dominant thinking, he will be on the other side of it at any given moment in time. But let's talk about Musk quickly. He's not the controlling metaphor of your book, but he is the controlling genius of our moment. Do you think his recent foray into politics—does that tarnish him? Because I was thinking: there's a science writer based in Canada named Dan Gardner. He has a fabulous Substack called Past, Present, Future, or something like that. He wrote a lot about Henry Ford. And he was like, "Hey, I want to tell you a story about a carmaker who really kind of blew his reputation by talking about stuff he didn't really know anything about." And it's about Henry Ford, who was a great genius at mass production and all of this kind of stuff. And then he got bored running a car company, and he's like, "OK, I'm going to solve World War I." And didn't he become a massive antisemite? Oh, he was. He is the Bob Dylan of antisemites. I don't know who's the ultimate Jew. He went electric. Yes, absolutely. And then he also ended up suing people who libeled him for describing him accurately, and then losing status in public court hearings. Because he's an idiot about all of this kind of stuff. Where does that story go? Because he is the epitome of galaxy brain. It's like: he's good at these things, so every thought he has is good, and we have to put up with him. You know, he was working for an administration where people want to have more kids and be Christian. We don't know how many children he has—virtually none of them in a marriage setting. He's divorced, and increasingly it's not even clear how many there are or under what circumstances they were born. That's one thing people tolerate—because he's good at making money and making cars. But then this political foray, where he's going back to Texas—is that the type of thing that destroys his geniusness, or does it remain to be seen? I mean, I think it does. How I've always felt about it is: SpaceX, which is the truly innovative business—if it manages to make reusable rockets work in that way that drives down the cost of space travel, that allows us to become an interplanetary species—I would have thought, in 400 years' time, we're not going to be talking about his bad tweets. But at the current rate, I think he deeply risks falling into that Shockley pattern—of somebody whose juice kind of runs out. Because look at the DOGE as we're talking, he's just been giving this round of kind of exit interviews complaining it was a lot harder than he thought it would be. And you know how he could have found out how hard it would have been? He could have asked me—an idiot—to tell him that. The fact is, governments are harder to run than private businesses, because you can't have creative destruction. You can't just let a government fail and someone else move in—people die, people don't get their Social Security checks. These are important things. But instead, he trampled through that undergrowth like a huge rhino, insistent that he knew best. And—shock horror—if he'd gone into that with his undoubted skills, but had learned more first, he would have been more successful at it. Well, from a Reason angle, it was frustrating, because there are people who work at Reason—but also there's a whole Gulag Archipelago of think tanks—of people who have said, "This is how you cut government spending and waste," etc. And, like, there are almost off-the-shelf plans you can bring in as opposed to going in and not succeeding. Ones that are increasingly picking up traction on the left, right? If you look at the whole abundance agenda—a lot of that is really saying, places like California don't work because they overregulate. What's that phrase of Ezra Klein's? "Everything bagel liberalism"—where it's like, "Why don't we make this housing project also solve racism and wild birds?" So there's definitely a libertarian critique that people feel government is slow and sclerotic. And a more humble man might have read those things first. The point with Musk is that—I guess this is part of where geniuses go to destroy themselves—they really don't think that, as your book argues—and I think it's completely persuasive—that breakthrough technologies are never the result of one person. But when you get exalted like that, then you stop looking around for the expertise or the team that will actually help you produce results. Then you're looking for yes men, or people who will… Your circle becomes—you become Kanye West or something, where nobody around you is going to say no. Yeah. And I think the really interesting examples of that—Picasso and Einstein are probably our most obvious examples. Most people's go-to ideas of artistic and scientific genius. But Einstein never really accepts quantum mechanics. So when he dies, he's more a celebrity than the kind of person in the field that young physicists look to. And Picasso similarly doesn't go to pure abstraction—he doesn't end up in the place of Rothko. That's because they had their paradigm shift. They had the moment where they were the perfect brain to meet the moment. And I think you probably see something very similar with Musk. He had a playbook—which, if you read Character Limit, the book about his takeover of Twitter—you know, he brings in his lieutenants, they lock everybody out of the systems, they fire everyone and rehire that they need. He just had this way that had worked for him in the past. And he went, "Bring on big balls, I'm going to do that to the government too." And he didn't realize that it was not the same environment, and that his one thing that had worked before would now not serve him anymore. And that, to me, exactly is what you're saying. It's a classic genius myth: you think, "I've got the answer," not realizing that different questions have different answers. Right. Yeah—and to go back to that idea of domain-specific intelligence or expertise: not everything is like everything else. That was one of the great myths in American capitalism in the mid-20th century that was destroyed—the idea that all businesses, regardless of what you produce, can be managed by a set of professional managers who are trained in management. And it turns out shipbuilding is very different from oil production, which is different from newspapers, and all of that. If I may—are there good examples of geniuses who run into the wall that Musk has driven his Tesla into with Dogecoin and everything—who then come back? Are there Paul McCartneys, whose second truth or last two-thirds of a career are actually as good or as interesting as the first third? That's a really good question. And I'll probably have to give it more thought than I'm able to on the hoof, because— I'll tell you what—I can't think of any examples offhand, but as you're saying that, I can totally see what a great story that is. And how much people would love that story. So there probably are examples of it. I'm thinking of the kid who was the actor in Indiana Jones who then didn't really do anything for ages and then won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once. People love that idea that this is the ultimate comeback story. So I can see that happening, where someone had been piddling away for a while and then came back with something. But I don't know. The best versions, I think, of people are your McCartneys or your Springsteens—or, you know, I went to see the Pixies last week. People who just carry on doing something because they clearly love it, the fans love it, and they enjoy it. And the Pixies gig was very interesting, because clearly people were there to hear the songs primarily from Surfer Rosa, their 1980s album. And they play those quite happily. Then they play some of their new stuff too. And I just thought: this is quite a good acknowledgment of: this was the moment we were hottest. We're not in that moment now. But we don't hate those people or resent that. We love that it happened. We're not sad that it didn't go on forever. That is fascinating. Yeah, I started my career as a teen magazine and rock music journalist. And there's nothing worse than bands or artists who hate the work that made them famous. It's an awful life. It's sad, isn't it? It's really sad. It is. And there are people—I'm thinking of someone like Nick Cave or Bob Dylan. They're very different, but Dylan refused to go away. He goes through cycles where stuff starts to make sense, even if it seems horrible the first time. And Cave has certainly been growing as an artist. And someone like Madonna—I think she stopped, in a way, but had a fantastic run. Can I just real quickly do a bit of biography? Because you mention at one point—and I thought this was fascinating in the book—that your father, in the '50s, took one of these inscrutable-to-Americans O-levels or A-levels, or whatever. I've read a ton of Beatles biographies, and they're always talking about how "I ruined my A-levels," and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's not easy to understand—like SATs. Yeah, no, of course—which is its own kind of bullshit. But your father did well on a test, and that meant that he got to go to university. What is your background, and how did you get to be where you're at? So the test you're talking about is the Eleven-Plus, which kids took at the age of 11. At the time—this is after… so my parents were both born in 1945—so this is in the aftermath of the Second World War. The idea was, if you came from a working-class family—and any other kind of family—that they were going to try and make higher-level education more accessible to a greater number of people. But the way to do that was by selecting viability. So you took this test at 11, and if you passed it, you went to a grammar school. If you didn't, you went to what was called a secondary modern or a technical school. The idea was that you either had an academic education or a vocational one based around going into trades. Because at 11—come on—the bread is baked, right? Well, that's a big… I mean, we mentioned Lewis Terman a long time ago. He also, earlier than that, thought that you could kind of pick future winners very early. And that's not always possible. The other thing it did was create—you know, you'll hear people today will say, "the Eleven-Plus was amazing because I got chances that I wouldn't otherwise got." But that's a kind of survivorship bias, because you don't hear as much from the people whose lives were ruined by being told at 11 they were not good enough. But in his case, it meant he was the first in his family to go to university. He went to Aston University in Birmingham to study chemistry. He worked first for Worcester Porcelain—where I grew up, which has its own delightful porcelain—and then for a place that made things you melt steel in—crucibles. Sorry, I know you're loving how much of an English stereotype I am, aren't you? Yeah. "It has a delightful bone china—from the Potteries." But you know, he benefited—definitely—he got lifted up like that. And on my mum's side, my granddad, who was Scottish, he was a coal miner. He moved south and took civil service exams as an adult. So he was the engine, he moved from working class to middle class, at that point. My mum then went to the same school I ended up going to, which was a convent school, a Catholic school. So I came from a really nice, normal middle-class high school. This was in the Midlands in England. I didn't know anybody who was a journalist. I didn't know anybody who lived in London. Even Birmingham was quite exciting to me. So I do have to remind myself every so often: if I could go back and talk to 16-year-old me about what I do and who I know, she would be pretty impressed. It is kind of fascinating, isn't it? There's a version of this in the U.S.—and I think throughout the West, and even much of the developing world—where tests, whether they're IQ tests or aptitude tests, they're used in many ways to reinforce the status quo or to naturalize it. But oftentimes, the goal—even when they were implemented—was not necessarily to do that, but to be more egalitarian and more meritocratic. Intelligence needs to be contextualized, and things like that. You know… Well, it's not necessarily a bad impulse, is it? Because actually, the signature event in my academic career was that I went to Oxford University, and that was determined— I said… A little place, yeah, in the Cotswolds. But that wasn't determined by a test for English—that was determined by an interview. And you know what? That obviously privileges eloquent bullshitters. The die was cast in my future in podcasting, because that's exactly what that selects for. Tests are bad in some ways, but they're also sort of… they're the worst thing apart from all the other things. We haven't yet invented a way of designing education that weeds out bias. The Eleven-Plus was notoriously problematic because it was easier for middle-class kids to pass it. They had more knowledge. Often just flat-out their parents hired tutors to get them through it. Now what happens is that there are very few grammar schools left, and the house prices around them are exceptionally high. So you end up with class sorting by who can afford to buy a house in that area. I mean, that's… to talk about the abundance agenda. And I always think when I hear about Ezra Klein, I'm like: If you want to read what Ezra Klein is going to write tomorrow, read what Reason was publishing 20 years ago. But part of it is—when it comes to educational opportunity and whatnot—the idea that, well, there are only 10 universities. So we have to sort to get the right people into that. It's like, maybe you create a world where there are many, many different universities—or more schooling opportunities—rather than funneling people through. In America, there was starting to retreat—not necessarily for good reasons—but there was this birth of gifted and talented programs. And most of the time, it wasn't just like, "If you hit this level of testing, you'll be in the gifted and talented program." It's like, "We only have a certain number of slots." And, well—if the test says you're gifted and talented, why don't you expand the program? But oftentimes, the function of schooling is not to increase opportunity, but to maintain the existing power structure. That's my idea. No, I know. And there's loads of stuff that happens like that. The Ivy Leagues, which excluded or limited Jewish students in the first half of the 20th century, they did that by saying, "We want to look at well-rounded students." Or they moved their recruitment pools out of New York City and into the outer boroughs—or whatever it might be. That's the only way I think T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound got into Ivy League schools—because they were from Missouri and Idaho. So they benefited from the geographical quota. But this is one of the big themes of the book: a level of humility about the systems we have and whether or not they are free from bias. And when the things that look natural and inevitable to us are actually the result of things we can't see—because, yeah, there are a lot of invisible hands. And actually, sometimes, extremely visible hands, if you care to look for them. Yeah, the Ivy Leagues now have a different way of keeping Jews off campus, right? So they—you know, it's more visible. This is not the first time that America's had debates about affirmative action. It just used to be that the affirmative action was in favor of WASPs in the 1920s. Yes, and I'm glad to live in a post-WASP America, for the most part. Just a final question about your method. Have you ever been called a genius? Hm. Why? One of the things that I find remarkable in your work—both the podcasting but then the writing work. I always take this as a sign of an excellent journalist—and I don't really care about "geniuses" is that you find a topic and then report out on it. And that way, you don't have to worry about a hot streak or a cold streak, because the onus isn't on you to be a genius all the time or to come up with new and novel things to say. You go out into the world and see what's happening. That seems to me that's a very rare model for journalism—but it obviously seems like the best way to do it. It's a great relief to just be like, "I am not actually that interesting. What I do is, I go and put myself in interesting places and meet interesting people—and I will tell you about them." And like you say, I'm surprised more people don't do it, because it's a huge burden off you. If you're not trying to be the main character in your drama—if you're content to be the amanuensis at the side—then yeah, it's a huge weight off your shoulders. And I think this is what drives a lot of modern journalists kind of mad: if you're only telling a story in which you're the protagonist, then you need to keep doing stuff. And actually, just go and talk to other people. Other people are mad. They say crazy things. That's Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his collection The New Journalism, which was about stuff from the '60s and early '70s, published in the early '70s. He said that, "it was amazing. So many weird things were happening in America, and all you had to do was go out and hang out with people." He's seen as someone who's a genius—he has genius insights and is a stylist—but he says in plain sight:" just go and talk to people who are doing things you think are interesting." And you are interesting. It's also just the most fun. I mean, there's nothing that makes me happier than being in some random bit of backstreet America, just talking to people whose life experiences are completely different from mine. And I wish more people got the opportunity to do it, to be honest. The color that you add to, you know, talking about going to—or witnessing—one of the SpaceX launches or recoveries is brilliant. You know, because it's out in the world. It's wonderful. I have kept you overlong—I apologize for that. Where are the best places people should look for your work? You can find most of it through my Substack, which is helenlewis.substack.com. And also my longer, more considered work is at The Atlantic, who are very kind in giving me—the thing that I really like about working for them is that they invest in you as a person. And like you say, reporting is the best and most fun thing to do. And it's not the easiest thing to do in journalism at the moment. So I give them huge credit for letting me—letting me be my best self. God, that sounded like therapy. Sorry—what a hateful note to end on. I'm going to go and have, like, a muffin and a crumpet and be overly British. Yeah, maybe talk about Princess Diana and how sad it is. Are you up on the royals? Do you like the royals? Oh, yeah. I know. There was a time during the Prince Harry saga where I was threatening to become The Atlantic's royal correspondent, just because I enjoy writing about them. And by God, do Americans love reading about them. I don't understand that. And I think Harry was best when he was following in—was it Edward VII or VIII?—when he was doing the Nazi costumes. I was going to say, "being a Nazi." It's all been downhill for him since then. Helen Lewis, thank you so much. It was a real delight talking to you. The Genius Myth is a spectacular book. It's the best thing you've written recently—until the next one. So thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Elon Musk Nick Gillespie | 6.4.2025 11:00 AM HD Video Download Today's guest is Helen Lewis, a British journalist and podcaster who is a staff writer for The Atlantic. Her new book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, and it explores how the definition of what it means to be a genius has changed radically over the centuries, how it became linked to all sorts of weird biological theories, and how Elon Musk has come to personify genius in our time (and whether his failure at the Department of Government Efficiency spells the end of his genius moment). Lewis and Reason's Nick Gillespie also talk about The Beatles; William Shockley, who turned to racial science after winning a Nobel Prize for helping to invent the transistor; and her notorious 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson for British GQ, which has racked up over 70 million views. 0:00— Introduction 1:36— The Genius Myth 7:20— How dead geniuses fueled national myths 11:30— Thomas Carlyle and the Great Man theory 18:18— Are inventions inevitable? 23:22— Francis Galton and eugenics 33:35— Pro-natalism and declining fertility rates 37:14— William Shockley 48:00— Shakespeare and The Beatles 57:22— Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and the gender dimensions of genius 1:03:50— Lewis' Jordan Peterson interview 1:07:18— Germaine Greer and second wave feminism 1:11:05— The gender debate in the UK vs US 1:14:14— Elon Musk's rise and fall? 1:20:57— Do geniuses have second acts?

Helen Lewis: Thank you for having me. Let's start with the obvious question. The book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, which is a great subtitle. But why did you write The Genius Myth? Do you know what, it's one of those things where it's evolved over time, so I may be now lying to myself about why I wrote it. But I did have a conversation with a friend a couple of years ago about the idea that—he has always said that genius is a right-wing concept, which I thought was a really interesting idea because it's about the individual over the collective. It's about people with sublime achievement who are not part of the common throng. And I thought that was interesting. I thought, well, I hear loads and loads of left-wing people use it very casually, and I don't think they're accepting this kind of idea behind it. And then that made me think, well, hang on a minute, what other ideas are kind of being smuggled in in that little word? And that's where the book kind of came from. That's fascinating. And it puts me in mind—the book is fantastic. I mean, it is a great read. It's better than 99 percent of novels I read. And I love—it's a series of stories about kind of crazy people and the people, including all of us, who enable them. But part of what you talk about in The Genius Myth is that being a genius meant radically different things in different eras. Explain in ancient Greece—and I don't know why we care about what ancient Greece thought about anything—but the Greeks talked about having genius, or being a genius meant that you were possessed with a visiting spirit. Can you explain what that means? Yeah, you have a genius—that's the original sense of it. You're visited by this spirit, and you know, it might be the muse of poetry speaks through you, or the muse of history. And they called it furor poeticus, furor divinus—divine fury. And I think that captures something really well. I don't know if you would describe yourself as a genius, Nick, but most of us wouldn't. But you must have had moments when you've sat down— No, very few people have defined me as a genius, so thank you. But you might have had times when you sit down to write a piece or do some piece of work, and it just clicks. Something just feels really good. And I think most writers probably spend most of their life kind of chasing that dragon for the rest of the time. You go, 'when will it come back?' And that's what writing should feel like, and most of the time it's just a kind of grind. So I think they did a very good thing then in capturing something that we've all felt to some extent. There are moments that work. You talk about how, particularly in the context of things like pop music and whatnot—and this is certainly true for writers and novelists in particular—you go on a streak where you are just performing at a higher level. I want to get into an argument about the Beatles for any number of reasons. It's independent of you—I have this argument every morning. But when you look at somebody like Paul McCartney, who you talk about in an interesting way, he's got to understand that whatever he's been doing for the past 40 years is not what he did for that 5- to 10-year period. He was on. So you go from that classical understanding of genius as a visiting spirit or something is speaking through you—which now is almost always the province of serial killers, right? I guess I had the dog talk to me, and it told me to kill me. They're the last classical geniuses in this tattered world. But then in the Renaissance things shift—the Renaissance and the early modern period. How does being a genius change in that period? Maybe even a little bit later than that, because the thing about the Renaissance is always that the word comes from rinascita—rebirth. So the idea was that they were, as they saw it, bringing back the classical tradition. And it was kind of quite imitative—you were trying to learn these things about proportion and form. Well, I don't want to get sidetracked. I'm just going to say yes—they were smuggling what they wanted to do by saying, "What we're really doing is merely bringing back these eras of former greatness." There's the American Renaissance in American literature, which was created in the 1940s about the pre–Civil War period. And I believe there's a racial journal now called American Renaissance, which—they want to rebirth things. So in this early modern period redefinition of genius, what's going on? Then you get this very, very important book that I had to say I didn't really know about, which is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. And it is a group biography of—I have to say, all the artists that I would have known growing up because they were also Ninja Turtles, like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. But there is a sense that that was a period of a kind of burst of creativity, and he puts them together in this kind of pantheon. And it's one of the first times that you begin to see, in a really systematic way—this is what I mean by the genius myth. These are stories that we tell about people who are innovators or scientists or artists. So you have, for example, the story of Leonardo da Vinci. And the myth that's imposed on him is that he couldn't settle on anything. He had a kind of—an uber level of ADHD. He was designing the helicopter, then he wanted to learn how to paint directly onto a wall using tempura, then he was doing something else. He was kind of a scatterbrain. We have all met that person in our first semester in college as well—who's just so brilliant. Obviously Leonardo accomplished a few things, as well. It's true—not all of the people that you meet in the first semester at college go on to paint the Mona Lisa, or anything like it, sadly. But what I was getting at is that the Mona Lisa wasn't really the Mona Lisa until centuries after it. Until it got stolen. This is one of my favorite things in all of it. It's the same way that Shakespeare died a respectable playwright, but he didn't die the guy that we should enthrone forever as the crowning jewel of English literature. That really a century later. And exactly the same thing with the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa was—and I'm going to be really rude here and say—quite a sludgy gray and green painting, and not seen as the crowning achievement of the Renaissance by any means. It gets stolen in the 1920s and ends up in Italy. And it becomes—actually, as lots of these things do—about national myths, because Leonardo was Italian or proto-Italian, but he was working for most of his life in France. So it becomes a kind of 'Who owns this great genius?' and 'Therefore, who should have the Mona Lisa?' And then it becomes a kind of inter-country fight. It's also great because, in the United States in particular, Italians have always claimed Christopher Columbus. But now many of us Italian Americans are like, "Oh, maybe he was working for Spain, and maybe he is a Jew, so forget it. We don't need Columbus anymore." He's not The Sopranos… But da Vinci is one model of a Renaissance genius. Talk about Michelangelo or some of the others. The person categorizing them said, "OK, well, there are different gradations." He seemed very much like a boy with a bunch of Pokémon dolls or something where he's rank ordering them things like that. Yeah, well, he definitely had a bias. He had a pro-Florentine bias. So he's quite rude about Titian, who was born—I think— Venice or the Alps. But he kind of gets relegated to second status because he's not from the right place. But Michelangelo, he uses as a different example, which is something you find all the time in genius myths: which is someone who had to struggle. So that's turned into a story about how hard it was to paint the Sistine Chapel, and how he had to design all the stuff you'll hear if you go on the tour of the Sistine Chapel. The other thing that you will know from visiting the Sistine Chapel is that it's a lot. It's quite—it is a statement, is it not? Yeah. And I think that's kind of fascinating too—that you have to have a level of ambition. The film critic called it white elephant art. Which he didn't intend as a compliment—these films that kind of announce themselves as a masterpiece. And I think that actually is also quite pertinent to this. The fact that Ulysses by James Joyce is very hard to read—not an enjoyable novel in the conventional sense—is actually taken as being a sign of its genius. The fact that the Sistine Chapel is big…if he'd done that much individual painting and separated it out by canvases, we wouldn't find it quite so impressive as this one—you know, what's that German word? Kunstkammerwerk—you know, the kind of the whole thing is it. You have that word written on your computer, and you use it in every conversation that you ever have. That's true. I do, actually. Yeah, you've rumbled me. But you know what I mean—like that idea of the kind of… You still see it now when you have like, oh, Birdman, it's filmed like it was in a single shot, or The Revenant, oh it only filmed in natural light, or Tom Hanks really lost all the weight for Cast Away, or Charlize Theron made herself ugly for Monster. These are kind of—there's a price to greatness. I like the movies where people gain weight, because anybody can lose weight, right? If we may jump forward a little bit—and I want to skip over him a little bit, both because he deserves to be forgotten, but I want to get to a later figure in Victorian England—but Thomas Carlyle pops up a couple of times in your work. And he is kind of the modern conceptualizer, right, of Great Man Theory, which is related to genius but it's not quite the same thing. Life writing takes form, and then you get the Industrial Revolution and capitalism. And what you then get is genius really as a marketing tool. So, if you're an artist in the 14th century, what you need is a rich aristocratic patron. If you're an artist in the 18th century, 19th century—well, actually, at this point there'd be things like, you know, gallerists start arriving, things like newspapers arrive, mass media arrives, and you might therefore be able to brand, basically. But what's interesting is that most of the time, or at least at that point, it seems to be less the person selling themselves as a genius, and they have a Boswell—or they have somebody around them who is writing them up as, like, "Oh, this is the real guy," like a hype man. A Flavor Flav. Yeah, everybody needs an 18th century Flavor Flav. Yes, it's true. But then you have somebody like Thomas Carlyle, who, you know, very much of a… in the context of his time, it's not like he was a right-winger. And he hated capitalism, certainly. And he hated all of the liberal economists who actually thought that Irish people and Blacks in Jamaica were human in the same way he was. But how does he talk about Great Man Theory, and how does that kind of add to the genius lore before it gets kind of quantified and mathematized later in that century? Yeah, he has this line, which I'm going to mangle, but it's something like, "The history of the world is, at root, only the history of great men." And that was very in keeping with a certain type of patrician Victorian thinking—that you just needed these once-in-a-generation personalities. One of their references would have been someone like Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French general. And I think there's a lot to that argument—that actually, the military decisions that Napoleon made at the times that he made them changed the history of Europe. He was a consequential figure. In the same way that now The Atlantic just ran a cover story on Donald Trump that said he's the most consequential president of the 21st century. I do think it's a reasonable point to say that some people are kind of hinge points in history. I was gonna make a joke about like, what's his competition so far though? You know, it's—zombie Abe or whatever. And you thought—"No, I love Obama and I would never say anything mean about him." Well, I know. I said, unfortunately, from my stupid libertarian point of view, I see an immense continuity between George W. Bush, Obama, Trump I, [Joe] Biden, Trump II. And it's not a good continuity. But, you know, this is part of what you're talking about when you talk about The Genius Myth—you're not saying everybody is exactly the same, and it's just a social construction that Leonardo gets called a great artist, but actually anybody around him was as good. But it is this storytelling and kind of creating this sense that these people are the limit of everything that we're doing. But with Carlyle—so Carlyle—I guess in a way systematic thinking— this is what the Enlightenment was about. And to some degree, the Renaissance—it hadn't quite got there. And you certainly get there with somebody like [Karl] Marx and [Freidrich] Engels, where they kind of say, actually it's the system. It's the base—typically the economic base—that actually determines everything else. So we might forgive Carlyle this one thing of not really understanding. Oh, I totally forgive him because, you know, what's the easiest thing to do is to go, "Actually, it's both," because it obviously is both, right? Some people do make decisions, but also they are products of fundamental forces that are in society. And I guess—now let me, because I outed myself on my libertarian podcast show as a libertarian—maybe it's people like Adam Smith who started to talk about how things don't just happen. There are a lot of kind of occult forces, invisible hands and whatnot, that create order among seeming chaos. And you could extend that to individuals. I feel like this is a big part of your life's work—the meta story that you tell now—which is just that it's a mix of both. It's circumstance and it's individual effort. And that should in no way ever be controversial, but it seems like it constantly needs to be relearned. Absolutely. Because you bring up Carlyle, and he was writing defensively. That's what I didn't really realize until I looked more at that stuff. I sort of assumed everybody in the Victorian era was swanning around going, "Of course the thing is that just a couple of men changed the world." But no—he was writing to defend that idea against what he saw as the kind of forces of egalitarianism. There's a fantastic book called How the Dismal Science Got Its Name by David Levy, which is a study mostly of how Carlyle and other people like him treated the Irish in popular culture and academic discourse basically in the long 19th century. And they were mad that people were saying, "No, actually the Irish are pretty much like the rest of us. They follow incentives. They're not all gorillas or chimpanzees." And that's why Carlyle named the dismal science "the dismal science," because he said that was its main truth—that all humans respond similarly to incentives. What a dismal science that we're not somehow more elevated than the lower order. That's great—to accidentally coin a really great phrase like that when you're trying to be rude. Yes, right. But the point I try to make in the book is that we always end up coming back to Great Man Theory—even people on the left—because we want stories. And stories demand protagonists. Frankly, your biography of Napoleon is going to sell a lot better than your book about agrarian upheaval in France in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's just more interesting to have… You know, when you write a screenplay, the first thing anyone will ever tell you is you have to have a protagonist and they have to be active—they have to make decisions. That's how our minds want history to kind of work. But there's a brilliant paper that I reference in the book from 1922, about "Are Inventions Inevitable?" And the list that they have of the number of things that got invented simultaneously—the most obvious one is the telephone, right? Two people came up with the telephone, and only one of them gets the credit. I write about Edison—Thomas Edison—later in the book. And everybody had the idea for the light bulb. Every man and his dog had that idea because it's quite a simple conceptual idea. What they couldn't do for 100 years was manufacture it and reliably make it work. And the real genius of Edison, if he had it, was, I think, the New York City power grid. But again, that's just not as compelling a story as "Man invents light bulb" that you can see and hold in your hand. And Edison, then—and you point out that he ended up in a fight that he lost. I mean, he lost a lot of his invention battles overall. He was a proponent of direct current, and alternating current won out and ultimately kind of swallowed a lot of his activity. And with Edison, I mean, there's always the fascinating concept of Edison versus Tesla. So you have Edison as one kind of genius, and then Tesla as another—crazy, more romantic genius, because he ended in failure. Do you know, my favorite anecdote is the fact that Tesla walked out of Edison's lab—where he worked for a while—because they had a bet, which Tesla won, and then Edison got really grumpy about him. And I just think this is fascinating because—I don't know if you know this—a couple of months ago, the podcaster Sam Harris told the story. He had a bet about deaths during the coronavirus pandemic with Elon Musk, and Sam Harris won. And then he said, "So, where's my—pay up, son?" And then Elon Musk kind of just got weird—kind of grumpy—and ended their friendship. I like that. That is a great way for Sam Harris to call himself a genius. —is to call himself Tesla. But it is also interesting that, in the book, I had already made this comparison between Edison and Elon Musk—both in the sense of the style of invention they do, their talent for publicity, but also the ego, frankly, that has made them want to play the public role of an inventor. And I think that's where the bet story really comes from. Neither of them likes to be beaten or humiliated. They were both schemers—not ivory tower scientists happy to do their own thing and let the chips fall where they may. They both want to be out there in the world selling themselves. And so that echo was very pleasing. Yeah. And we'll talk more about Musk at the end, I think—or toward the end of this conversation. But Edison also was—he really did work long hours, but he also did what Benjamin Franklin called "visible industry." Like, he made sure you knew. How did you know Edison worked 24 hours a day? Because he told you every time he saw you, or he had people in the press who were either sycophants or on his payroll or whatever, who were telling people. It's not clear that he ever said that creativity or genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration, but that captured the image that he was pushing. Oh yeah. I mean, I've got actually—I think more respect for Edison as a businessman and as a marketer than I had when I came in. But you're right, because everyone wanted the myth to be that they were kind of—you know, the easiest mark is somebody who wants to believe what you're selling them. And everybody wanted to believe that he was this American Prometheus. You know, he was stealing fire from the gods. And this is what I mean—to come back to nationalism again. This was a time in which America was the future. Europe was kind of classy, but it was old and hidebound and dying. And America was the new continent of steel and electricity and the railroad and these big barons. And Edison fit that image that America had of itself at that time. So he slotted himself in very neatly. There was a pre-made genius myth for him as an American genius. Right. And if I'm remembering, there was a fantastic series of kids books called Childhood of Famous Americans. All right. And it was the same story told over and over again, but they would change the names and places. And there was one of Edison, and part of his myth is that at some point he was working as a baggage boy on a railroad or something, and he was missing his train, and he gets pulled in by his ears—which caused hearing loss. So he became a great telegraph operator, and his kids were nicknamed Dot and Dash. But a lot of it came from: he was a small kid from nowhere who had bad hearing because of this industrial accident, and then he becomes the greatest inventor of all time. And he gets rewritten as well as "Tom" Edison—young Tom Edison, like Tom Sawyer—rather than his actual first name, which was Alva. And that again just speaks to the kind of— The country hasn't been invented yet that's going to promote an "Alva" as their great inventor. Yeah. And there's a famous movie called Young Tom Edison with, like, Jimmy Stewart or somebody playing him. So this gets done again and again. But now let's bring it back to the evil effects of the British on public discourse, and let's talk about Francis Galton. Because what is interesting—you have the geniuses themselves who become public either because somebody writes about them or they're creating their own myth. But then you have somebody like Francis Galton, who helped kind of quantify—or tried to quantify—what genius meant, and also why it's hereditary and why it persists in certain types of people but not others. Explain who Francis Galton is. He was a really brilliant dilettante—from the time when you could just skip around and come up with lots of different things. He tried to create a beauty map of the British Isles and work out where the women were hottest. I mean, very much actually the precursor of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook in that respect. But was he a lifelong bachelor? He definitely was childless, right? He married, yes, but I can't detect any real enthusiasm for women—or, indeed, any other people at all. Did he marry—did he fight? Like, he was like, "The Orkney Islands have the hottest babes, so I'm going there," or something? No, I think it was—I think it was an arranged marriage. There's a bit in his memoir of his essentially like gap year, where he goes to Africa. One of the chieftains offers him a woman as a "temporary wife," and he declines because she's covered in— that orange pigment, and he doesn't want to get it on his white linen suit. And it's just the sort of most Englishman-abroad kind of colonial power. That's pretty amazing.You have a lot to be ashamed of. OK, thank you. I'll take that one actually. He was also the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. He came from this very storied family in the 19th century, and he therefore was familiar with the idea of evolution by natural selection. You know, this was the idea that survival of the fittest—that people passed down something that now we think of in terms of genes. They didn't have that kind of biological basis to it initially. But he was very interested to think, well, hang on a minute—you can breed dogs in all these different ways. You can breed cattle. Maybe we could breed humans. And this is what I mean about him not showing really any kind of… It just doesn't make sense… Right. Him not showing any kind of fellow feeling for other humans. It was like, "Where could this possibly go wrong? I'm sure this won't have any bad consequences whatsoever." And of course, it did, right? Because he coined the term eugenics, which is from "good birth," essentially, and then dysgenics—which you hear a bit about today. He wrote this book called Hereditary Genius, in which he tried to work out how frequently genius and high achievement occurred in the population and how it was passed down. And people were kind of slagging it off from the very beginning. There's a great dunk of it from a Victorian writer at the time—because he works out that there's a whole family of judges, and he essentially posits the existence of a kind of hereditary judginess. And someone else calls them a "snug little galaxy of jobbers," which I think is right. Just the idea that actually, if you're a judge and your nephew wants to be a judge, then there may be other ways by which that happens rather than pure genetic inheritance. But that's a very influential book among a whole generation of statisticians, because he was a brilliant statistician. And they were also heavily influenced by eugenics. Can I ask was he actually a brilliant statistician, or was he just really novel in what he applied statistics to? Like, he measured a lot of stuff and then said, "OK, well, it means this," but. I mean, the question is— —have concepts like standard deviation, correlation, things like that—they come from his thinking and his work. So he's there right at the birth of this discipline as an academic one. So I think you can say that he was brilliant. And to go back to the idea of, like, do individuals create inventions or do larger forces produce them—is he, as England is moving out—or as the modern world, certainly Europe, is moving out—of kind of inherited aristocracy, he provides a rationale for why the ruling class deserves to be. And this is more of a Marxist kind of interpretation, but it's that Victorian England had to produce Francis Galton, because otherwise people would be like, "Why am I listening to these people simply because they, when I was born, had more money than me?" Yeah, I think that's very true. And also, he provides an excellent justification for imperialism, which was also a great enthusiasm of England at the end of the 19th— He didn't create it. But then provides a justification for what's happening anyway. Which, yeah, in a lot of social theory—that probably, well, now that I'm thinking about it, might be a better interpretation of a lot of social theory—that it's not leading where society goes, but it's rather kind of explaining why we're doing what we're already doing. Yeah, I think you can say there was a kind of Francis Galton–shaped hole in the discourse, and he popped into it quite neatly to say, "Europeans are of better racial stock than Africans," right? And that was obviously something that white Europeans were very keen to hear at the end of the 19th century. Well, some of them, right? Because it really took a couple more generations to figure out, "OK, well, which…who are the Europeans who are actually European, as opposed to Africa due north?" I mean, by the end of the 19th century, you had people who were like, "Well, the Nordics and the Alpines are OK, but these Mediterraneans, like, nah—they're not really…" Well, that's where we have to flick it over to the Americans really taking up the mantle on that. Because they just went, "Hang on a minute. Polish people aren't quite European. Italian people aren't quite European. Irish people aren't quite European. We mean the Nordics, right?" And that's how our racial laws are going to say that the true descendants of the ancient Greeks, bizarrely. I don't know why the ancient Greeks got away scot-free, despite being from Southern Europe, as being very intelligent. If they were so good, they wouldn't have gone away. I mean, this is what I just—I don't understand. But yeah, you're right. He just becomes a very influential figure in what then develops into eugenics and race science. His name has recently been taken off a lot of buildings at University College London. And it's one of those ones where I think I'm ok with it. You know, I think there are lots of cases for whether—- went too far… Am I remembering correctly—part of his research method was measuring the column inches or the number of mentions in encyclopedias of famous people to kind of— He did obituaries, yeah. And then Havelock Ellis, who was a sexologist, does another book in which he basically gets out a ruler. And this is the problem that always happens with these people—they get completely stuffed by Shakespeare, about whom we know very little, and Jane Austen, who lived a very quiet, boring, blameless life in a parsonage. So the biographical idea that you just—you have a lot of biographical detail and you get written about a lot—completely falters. And then they just end up fudging these supposedly scientific lists. Which is the methodology that Charles Murray used in his book Human Accomplishment, where he looked at reference works and measured column inches. Which I think probably calls more for a Freudian interpretation rather than a mathematical interpretation of what's going on. Right. I think you can say it's all interesting data, but it's not objective scientific data. Because you can measure how someone's reputation has changed over time, but you can't say there's a kind of version of just desserts where the most intelligent people get the most column inches. I think our own media at the moment would heavily debunk that idea. Talk about eugenics briefly, because we're also—and this is in the Muskosphere and Peter Thielosphere and stuff like that—where people are talking about eugenics. It's one thing if you're saying the state is running things and saying, "You can mate with these people but not those people," and things like that. You know, when you are going to Burning Man or you're at the Bohemian Grove and it's a voluntary association, we all are eugenicists. We all practice some form of "good birth," where we choose these people rather than those people. Is there a way to disentangle eugenics from its kind of history? Is there a eugenics which does not immediately—or quickly—devolve into racial sorting and some kind of horrific cataclysm of human suffering? In practice, I think, no. I think in theory, you're right—it doesn't have to go in those directions. And I think actually—again, I think you're kind of alluding to this—most people, when you drill down to it, are softly eugenicists themselves. Most people: A, they choose their partner because they think their partner is attractive and smart and would be a good father or mother—which is itself kind of eugenics. The second thing is that most people are broadly supportive of women having abortions of babies with severe and life-limiting illnesses—even those like Down syndrome that aren't necessarily fatal. So, lots of people think that looking after a disabled kid would be really hard, and people should have the choice to opt out of that. I have this argument with one of my friends, who has written brilliant books about eugenics. And I said, "But that is eugenic." And you just don't want to call it eugenics because, to you, eugenicism is bad. But you support this. And I think that's what I mean about in practice, I think there are things that people do agree with that you could describe as eugenic. But in any kind of organized movement, it is so unbelievably tainted by what happened in California in the '30s—huge amounts of sterilizations of the quote-unquote "feeble-minded"— by what had happened under the Nazis, that no reputable scientist would touch it with a 10-foot bargepole. And I don't really see the need to rehabilitate it in these individual cases. Do you see any—I realize it's a little bit off topic—but we are now, because there is a demographic collapse happening. It's women's fault. Women are having fewer children now that they have more job opportunities. Right, because they're grasshoppers, and they reproduce by themselves. Yeah, it's women's fault, yeah. But throughout the West—certainly in the U.S., but then especially in those old parts of Europe that maybe really aren't European, places like Hungary—there's a big push for natalism. The state needs to pump up the volume of kids being born. And countries like Singapore spend millions—or billions—of dollars a year trying to do that. Is that a form of eugenics as well? Should we be concerned, from a history-of-eugenics point of view, about what happens when the state starts to say, "You need to be having more kids"? I think the main contradiction to that is that we don't have any evidence that it works. Stalin had a medal that was like—if you had 10 kids, you got a medal. Yeah, I think it was six or something, but yeah. I mean, to me, what I consider to be a lot of children. And there have been regimes through history that have tried to—currently, Viktor Orbán in Hungary said very explicitly, "I don't want more immigrants. I want more Hungarians." And he has put in tax breaks for people who have more than three children, reductions on the people carrier, you know. But with negligible effects, from what I can see. Unless you're running a really brutally directive society like China, where you can dictate to people how many kids they have— And that it was more about having fewer. But now it's like, "Please, please, can you—people—start having children again? We've realized this is a demographic problem." And I think that will be harder to reverse than the previous one-child policy. That's the thing that's interesting. And I think actually—oh, I've forgotten her name, the brilliant researcher Alice—and I've just talked to Ross Douthat about this at The New York Times—that actually it's not even just the West. Quite conservative societies in North Africa are also seeing this reduction in birth rates. No, it tracks perfectly with the proxy that I've seen brooded about a lot is the number of years of education women have on average. As that increases, fertility rates decline—always and everywhere. And it's that the world has become more modern, meaning that women have more opportunity and more equality and more education. I know Mexican women in Mexico have more kids than they do in America. They cross the border, and they have fewer kids. And that's not even that big a difference. But everywhere, yeah—it's a global phenomenon. And I think it contributes as a sign of progress, actually. Because it means more people, I think, are making more choices. I think it's a sign of progress. I think it's very hard to square with our current gerontocracies in terms of our political systems. I mean, that's the problem. In Britain having fewer working-age people to support more older people is a problem, when those older people are on unsustainably high pensions and earlier retirement… You know, I have a political ideology of limited government and a basic social safety welfare net that I would love to sell to you right now. The problem isn't that people are getting older; it's that we have unsustainable entitlement programs that we can thank Bismarck for. Oh, right. OK. Yeah, OK—so we've put, so far, the villains of today's podcast as the English and Otto von Bismarck. OK, good to have the enemies list updated. Come on, surely let's argue about the Beatles now, Nick. You've been holding out on me. Yeah, well, before we get to them, I want to talk about William Shockley, who is somebody that I think a fair number of my audience will remember. He encapsulates something perfect—partly because he is related, he's a kind of semi-direct descendant intellectually of Galton. But he is also fantastic because he brings us closer to Silicon Valley. William Shockley won a Nobel Prize for his role—contested as it may be—in developing the transistor. And then he became a—you know, he took that— He was a massive prick. And everybody left his firm, and they went on to found Silicon Valley. That's the short way. That's right. On the business end, he had this great creation, or he was part of a great invention, and then he was such a terrible manager that everybody who worked for him—who were incredibly talented—were like, "Fuck it, we're going to start our own company." And that became modern Silicon Valley. And then he spent the rest of his life, "electronics, who cares, I want to talk about racial differences that are quantifiable." And he is the genius, in a way, who precedes many other figures that we'll talk about, but where he was great at one thing, and then spent most of his time talking about stuff—that is just crazy pants—and it takes away from his luster as a great inventor. Yeah, I was just rereading the interview that he did with Playboy. It was one of those kind of great heyday-of-Playboy, nine-billion-page interviews. And it's just—it's really sad to see somebody who obviously had a great scientific brain, but they've just picked up a load of goo, basically. Like, for example, he didn't—you know, the interviewer talks to him about his decision to donate to the so-called Genius Sperm Bank, which is a kind of cursed idea from the start. But he has no idea that men's sperm degrades with age and that at 70, the old swimmers might not be in the best condition. And he just completely hasn't looked into that. And it's a kind of sad version of someone who obviously had a great and flexible intellect in their youth, and they've just kind of hardened. And I don't know about you, but when I was reading that, it felt like one of those kind of internet–social media–era midlife crises ahead of its time. I'm sure the obvious example is Naomi Klein's book about Naomi Wolf, a great feminist scholar, gets caught out and then drifts into the kind of QAnon sphere Wolf found out on—was it the BBC? Live on radio. She basically had a book that was about gay men. And she said that there were a number of them who were executed for sodomy. And it turned out that the phrase that had been written was "death recorded." And that didn't mean they'd been executed. That meant that they'd had a death sentence and actually most of them had ended up commuted or whatever. But it was just this very embarrassing thing that dented her credibility in the liberal sphere. So she went over to the other side. And here is—I'm going to make—this is an act of genius that I almost certainly won't pull off, because I'm not a genius. But that moment where she is live talking to the interviewer who points that out to her, and she's like, "Oh… oh." I mean, you just see something change. It's almost like having a stroke. It's very similar to the moment—and I believe you mention this in the book—the Peter Jackson documentary about the Beatles, Get Back, when the song "Get Back" comes into recognizable form. Where the Fab Four are noodling around, and then suddenly you hear this classic song come into being. Yeah, it's a live-action shot of somebody who basically—and I think this is exactly what happened to Shockley. Shockley won his Nobel Prize, the career stalled, he couldn't understand what happened to it. He made, I think, one idle comment about IQ and everyone screamed at him. And he did exactly what happens to lots of people now in that situation, where he felt like that was unfair and unjust, and so he kind of did it harder. And he became a provocateur, and he got into this mindset of, "The more that I'm owning the libs, the righter I must be." And I think you just—you see that. I still think you see that now, and I understand it psychologically. Yeah, like you say, "I'm this thing that you know is horrible, and it's like I'm going to be your worst nightmare version." And in the point about Shockley—and this is, I mean, a credit to the book and to your work—is that Shockley was not— here was an ongoing study of IQ and super-smart kids in California that he did not make the cut for. So you have a guy who becomes obsessed with IQ as this thing that is free-floating and independent from all sorts of influences. And you have to—I mean, anybody reading that in the contemporary world would say, "Oh, he became obsessed with IQ because he was a genius, but he was not ratified as a genius in this grammar school or high school study going on in California." I found that very telling. Yeah, that's Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of the Gifted, and the cutoff point was either 140 or 135 on this particular IQ score. And he claims that his mother got an IQ score of 150, but he was below it. And actually, there was one other Nobel Prize winner, Luis Alvarez, who also didn't make the cut. And the really sad thing is, in that Playboy interview, he says, "Well, you know, I think probably my IQ has gone up a bit since then," which isn't really how it works between being a school kid and being 70, right? But obviously—you can—yeah, I think you're exactly right. When I read that, I thought, oh, there's the chip on the shoulder. That actually, he's had all the success—what more success could you want than having a Nobel Prize if you're in the sciences? But somehow, there's some little bit of him that still feels he's not enough. And actually, if he clings to this idea of superiority through IQ—racial superiority through IQ—that rubs a little bit of salve on that chip. What goes into people who—and I want to get to the Beatles, because I can talk about The Beatles endlessly. And I met Paul McCartney once— Oh, wow! Yeah, as a college kid. So it was quite exciting, and it led to one of the reasons that I no longer like The Beatles so much. Oh, ok? So that's a good tease, right? But to focus on Shockley a little bit—what goes on where you are a genius in this field or this set of fields—manufacturing, science, invention, electricity—and then you say, "Well, fuck it. What I really want to talk about is race and IQ"? You mentioned, like, his career seemed to stall because nobody—literally nobody—wanted to work with him. They were like, "I'm leaving. You cannot lock me in this factory anymore. I'm just going." But how does that happen? Because this is part of what the book is about. We're in a golden age now where if you are really good at making money on Wall Street, or if you are really good at inventing an electric car, if you are really good at making pop music, we really want to hear your thoughts about all of these other fields that you know absolutely nothing fucking about. I know. It's strange, isn't it? I think, yeah, that does seem to me the Shockley story. There is a heavy suggestion that he kind of piggybacked on the precise version of the transistor that won the Nobel Prize—it was really other people's work—and that people in the lab got tired of him being a kind of credit hog. And then he started getting into applying psychometric testing to his employees, which is always a red flag, I would say. If I may—I've never had to take a psychometric job test, or one that presented itself as such, but my father worked for a shipping company and he used to tell this story that I found very funny. It was called Sea-Land, and it kind of popularized containerized shipping in the postwar era. But it was founded by a guy named Malcolm McLean, who was an illiterate son of sharecroppers in North Carolina. And then, at a certain point, when the company got big enough, they were like, "OK, you've got to start taking business seriously." And they had all of the employees take kind of basic IQ tests to see if they were Sea-Land–worthy people. And Malcolm McLean failed it—because he was basically illiterate, and he was not functioning at the higher level. But, you know—so you had this moment in the heyday of scientific management, where a guy who revolutionized shipping would not be hired at his own company because he was kind of retarded. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, so I always— It doesn't surprise me, because I think that, you know, you would always want to have a higher IQ than not. But I think people overrate that—when you're getting way above the average—how important it is versus personality traits like conscientiousness, openness to experience, whatever it might be. So I think I'm entirely unsurprised by that, but your question kind of speaks to one of the things I talk about in the book, which is this idea of galaxy brainlessness. Which is the idea that, "I'm a smart person, all my opinions are smart." And I think it's just demonstrably not true. And the other thing is—I think it's really sad for the geniuses themselves. Because you look at someone like Shockley, and he has his success because his type of intelligence and his breakthroughs interact with a particularly fertile moment in the history of Silicon Valley, right? He had the right brain for the right time. And what often happens to people is that that lasts for a while, and then it goes away. And that is a really traumatic process for them—particularly if they've become kind of high on their own supply, and they believe that they're a superior sort of person. You know, "Why—I'm pressing the gas pedal and the car's not moving forward anymore," and they can't understand it. And that does often, I think, lead people to kind of bitterness and resentment rather than a kind of appreciation of, "Most people don't get one hot streak. Maybe I won't get two, but the one I had was pretty good." So this is a good segue to talk about The Beatles and the music or creativity streaks where either you're hot, and then suddenly you're not. And I guess part of—we have been, I don't know, and I'm assuming broad social trends in Britain are similar to America—but certainly over the past 30 or 40 years, we have been pushing galaxy brain ideas on schoolchildren and things like that. You know, the idea that you have a domain-specific genius or intelligence doesn't seem to be in favor. We talk about general intelligence, and it's kind of like if you're good at one thing, you're going to be good at everything. So—I mean, we're kind of reaping that whirlwind. I'm not even sure I'm using that term properly, but—because people like Elon Musk are told when they're a kid, "Well, you are really smart. You do great on standardized tests, so everything you say—you get an A in every subject." So like, why wouldn't you start talking about fertility or something like that? So let's talk about the Beatles a bit. How did The Beatles—I mean, it's fascinating, you know, Shakespeare and The Beatles are like the two great British exports, right? Yeah, yeah. And I really appreciate your focus on the way that all of this stuff plays into national myth-making and things like that. When you talk to French or German people, they're like, "Yeah, Shakespeare's pretty good, but he's not great." English-speaking people—and Americans, I think, probably love Shakespeare more than English people—because we have spent, you know, a couple hundred years trying to be like, "No, Melville—he's as good, and Walt Whitman." During graduate school, I studied American literature, and it was fascinating—right around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and then the Soviet Union collapsed. And suddenly, Americanists who had been spending 50 years searching for the American Shakespeare were finally like, "Hey, you know what? We don't actually have to worry. Britain is now a minor literature because America is—our literature matters because we're the world power. We don't have anything to apologize for on some level." But roundabout way of getting to the Beatles—like, you particularly talk about how, within the Beatles mythology, John is seen as the kind of genius, and Paul is—you know, he's like the job, right? He's just a hard worker. What goes into that, and why do you pick Paul over John? Well, for a start, I say this slightly incendiary line, which is: I think in terms of their long-term reputation, we're very lucky that it's Paul who's made it to 80, and John is now a hallowed memory. Because I think if John were still around, he'd be an extremely grumpy reactionary—probably doing quite bad tweets. That would be glorious, though. Whereas Paul McCartney has grown into that kind of father-of-the-nation role, and the younger musicians can make pilgrimage to him. Oh, and it's interesting—I'm sorry to interrupt—but I know George Harrison, who's also important in this kind of holy trinity. And you realize, as age goes on, that Ringo is the only Beatle really worth caring about in the long run. But— Ringo is lovely in Get Back, right? One of my friends described him as being like this sort of lovely Labrador. He's actually like a sort of emotional support animal—because he's there, just exuding Ringo energy. He calms everything down because people don't want to have a row in front of Ringo. And they don't want to upset Ringo. And actually, that is an underrated skill in the high crucible of tempestuous creative motion. Well, but George—towards the end of his life, by the '90s—he was grumpy. When Oasis openly paid a compliment to him by talking about "Wonderwall," which is a reference to his first—or near first—solo album, he was like, "Oasis sucks." He hated everybody younger than him. He was grouchy and grumpy. I mean, Oasis's reputation has not stood the test of time, has it, as a… No, I don't think so. They were— They had a lot of concerts. I think that might be an interesting one to see when people have their own music. Well, and they have their own—that's a variation, right, on the genius theme. The brother who writes everything is really the genius. I mean, they're doing the version of The Kinks with Ray Davies and Dave— Right. And two people who hate each other because they've both got something the other hasn't, right? Liam hates Noel for being able to write songs. And Noel hates Liam for being the charismatic frontman. Anyway, but there's a similar version of that with John and Paul, where John is cast in the role of being the rock bad boy. And that's what people kind of want at the time from their singers. Whereas Paul is seen as kind of domestic and managerial and a bit of a boring admin guy. And his songs focus on mundane stuff, whereas John is writing much more surreal and whimsical stuff—and that's seen as more creative. So you see by the end of the breakup that they've been put into those two categories, and that John has got the much more flattering one. But I don't think it would necessarily— —from a kind of romantic demonic—you know, like the Romantics loving Satan. John is that kind of rock creative genius. Yeah, exactly. Untamable, weird, odd. You know, him and Yoko were kind of wandering around filming their bottoms and all that kind of stuff. He's performing a much more obvious genius role. Whereas Paul McCartney has gone to live on a Scottish island, and send his kids to a public school, and wanting to be, quote, "as normal," right? Trying to live as normal a life as a rock star could live. And therefore—one of the things—I was just talking to a playwright last week about the book. And I said, the thing is, people would rate you as more talented if you were just weirder. You're too normal. You should try and cultivate an aura of eccentricity, because people would misread it as brilliance. I want to get to two other points before we stop talking. And I guess the first is: it's called The Genius Myth. Part of it—I can hear people being like, "Oh, you're just putting down anybody who accomplishes things. You are cutting down the tall poppy or whatever." The Canadian band Rush has a great song called "The Trees," which is about how all the maple trees are trying to keep this oak from growing taller than them. And, you know, they were in an Ayn Rand phase when they produced that. The maple leaf must be the regular Canadian, and they just don't want, you know, Rush to become too big. But it's about the myth, you know. How did you become interested in not the things that people do that are interesting, but in the way that it ends up being talked about? I think people in groups are completely fascinating. Because—I don't know about you—but I find it hard enough to understand individual people. The fact that they think in completely different ways to me. And just—things that to me are completely obvious, they just disagree with me on. And it's kind of life's project to be like, "Oh—other people's brains are different." But then you add in the complexity of them being in crowds, and it becomes completely impossible to understand why people do the things that they do. So lots and lots of my writing—about political movements, about social change—focuses on exactly those kinds of weird emergent properties of people in groups. And that's what interested me about this: you don't get to declare yourself a genius. You can try, right? Lots of people have. And quite a lot of them have been cruelly rebuffed. But genius is created by a crowd looking at you and adoring you and hailing you. And therefore, the interesting question is not just to talk about the properties of the people who are being adored, but the properties of the crowd. So I'm always really interested in celebrity—- Yeah, you talk about Elon Musk in the beginning of the book as an argument about what society values, but also what we're willing to tolerate because it's this whole pact. How did we get to a point where we're going to say—and this is an older example—but it's like, "Well, Roman Polanski deserves to fuck any child that he wants because he made Chinatown." I mean, generally, that is the way that people used to talk about it. They used to say that it was— That's how Bernard-Henri Lévy, the great human rights advocate, said it when Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and was going to be deported to the U.S. Yeah, or like, "It's not rape rape," or, you know, all these kind of weaselly things. Or, "It was Philistines"—that's what one French actress said: "You're Philistine," and then this campaign of smearing against him. And you're like, I'm going to stay at this wild position that I don't think it's good to drug and sexually assault teenagers. Just call me a prude, if you will. And to confess to that. He pled guilty and then he fled because he was worried that the plea bargain that was in place might not come through on the terms that he wanted. To talk about the kind of people who helped create the myth—you have a great chapter, and I'm misreading the title because I don't have it, but it's about the widow of the genius. You talk about people like Orwell's wife, but I'm especially interested in talking about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, who was an artist—plausibly of equal talent, potentially—but she kind of consciously, ultimately played a role of saying, "OK, I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to kind of build up his myth." Can you talk a little bit about that? And also, one of the things that I find fascinating—this is about your work in general—but it's particularly strong in this book— the gender dimension to all of this. Because geniuses—when you think of a genius, you think of a boy genius. You don't think of a girl genius. Oh, the Romantics were quite explicit about this. They thought genius was a male property, but it was a man who had a kind of feminine spirit within him. You know, this was the idea of a poet. But they're not girls. No. It was fae, sort of feminine men—but never butch ladies. No, that was not the same at all. So those roots of the gendering of genius are really, really deep. And I think there's pretty good research that says we're more likely to describe boys as brilliant. That is just an adjective that we apply more readily to men than to women. But is that something relatively recent? And then it becomes hard because in terms of, if we're talking about harder-core patriarchal structures…I had a conversation with Richard Dawkins once where he was talking about various things, and I was just like, "Yeah, it's really weird to me that, like, girls—you look back in human history and girls just couldn't pole vault until about 1985. Is that because of biology?" I grew up in a world, in high school, where girls were not allowed to participate in the pole vault because they couldn't do it. Evolution did not allow them to have the upper body strength to pole vault. How many times do you recognize things that are treated as facts of nature are obviously social constructions and change? And I'm not denying differences between men and women— Oh sure. No, I'm sure women are worse at pole vaulting, right? They do not do as well. It's definitely sex-linked. What I'm getting at is the question of girl and boy geniuses—because we now live in an age where, you know, the equality of sex is certainly under the law. And even in places where testing is used, you know, girls do better in high school, girls get into college more often, they graduate college more often. Are we going to look forward to a future of girl geniuses that are as insufferable as the boy ones? Well, that's the final dream of feminism, isn't it? To be as insufferable as men. Yeah, I don't know—because I think that's a really interesting question. There are undoubtedly women who have really high achievement in ways that they were previously blocked out of. But there's still an open question about whether or not there are sex differences in the kind of selfishness and ambition that's required to be like a William Shockley. Actually—are these traits that we really want to encourage in our children? The kinds of things that make you the Nobel-winning scientist? Or—that's also an interesting question about the fact that science has changed so much. There's very little low-hanging fruit that one person can now do. Most great science projects now are deeply collaborative—often across countries. But it's also about who the crowd wants to hold up as the genius. And I still think that both men and women are more reluctant to idolize women. So I don't think it necessarily will level out, actually. Because again, it's not an objective awarding of a quality—it's not something awarded on merit. It's about why you are celebrating someone—because of what it says about you, or what it says about the qualities you want to stress. So, you know, we definitely do have more women who are celebrated now. And also—the other thing I would say about, to go back to Lee Krasner—my editor made a very good note in that chapter which I incorporated. She has been the benefit of a explicitly feminist genius myth. Which is that feminist historians love the idea of finding overlooked women and lifting them up and celebrating them. You see that with Artemisia Gentileschi, the Renaissance painter. You see it with Krasner. And so there are a new set of genius myths, which are sometimes in themselves quite reductive—the poor, downtrodden woman who never got her flowers during her life, and now we're here, as the historical court of appeal, to make that right. So yeah, there will be some women who benefit from that. But I would doubt that it will level out anytime soon. What kind of pushback do you face when you bring up the social context of the creation of things like genius? Part of what your book is that there's a line or chapter like, "There really is no lightbulb moment." That Edison, tried a million different things, and all these people, etc. But you—for you—you certainly burst into a bigger view when, it was in 2018, when you had that great interview with Jordan Peterson. Yeah, what I like to do is confuse people by getting attacked from a completely different political tendency every couple of years and just switching it up. So, you know, there are people who've spent the last couple of years thinking that I'm this anti-woke conservative. And now I'm going to go through a phase where they think—I think you're right. The people who don't read the book will think this is some misguided egalitarian feminist nonsense that says, "Everybody can be Monet. Everybody can be Einstein. Everybody can be Picasso," or whatever it might be. So yeah, I think that there will be misreadings like that. You can only write the book. You can't force people to read it, tragically. It's a better world where authors cannot force people to read— I was going to say I couldn't read his book, but yeah. Well, he could get you to hold it up, right? And I guess Gaddafi did that too, right? He had his little Green Book—that's all over. I'm sure it's still in the basements of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi or whatever. But, you know, with that Jordan Peterson interview—what is amazing, like, when it came out, I watched it, and I was like, "OK, this is really—it's just great journalism." I mean, to your credit—what was funny to me, and more clear on a second viewing—is just that you're asking basic questions. And he is a male genius, and he uses ratiocination, he is incredibly learned—but it's like he's about to cry half the time. He is so emotional. Do you think we've entered into a period where men—the kind of male recourse to anger—is now being recognized less as, you know, genius and more as a failure to cope with what's going on in the circumstance? I hope that's true, because I know what you mean—particularly the kind of plethora of those very cruel videos of people having public meltdowns. I think you often see men melting down in public in a way that suggests they've just never learned to process and manage feelings of humiliation or denial, in a way that's quite unhealthy. And I think everybody would probably benefit from working a bit harder on that. But I'm pleased that you picked that up, because I do think it was very funny—because, you know, that was explicitly set up, that interview with Peterson— This was like—if I may make an analogy—this is like when Playboy sent a Black interviewer to General William Shockley. Sending GQ—sending a woman—to interview Jordan Peterson. For their Men of the Year issue. And that's the thing that's very funny, because everybody wanted it to be me—this kind of emotional little lady—and him to be the Great Man of Science loftily delivering his insights. But as you say, I'm there being quite sarcastic, because that's how I brawl. And he's the one who's kind of tearing up. It was actually very gender-nonconforming in that sense. So credit to everyone involved there. He fits into this category. He obviously toiled in the groves in the academy for a long time and had developed a certain kind of expertise and a certain level of reputation. And then when he broke big, now he's giving people tips on how to tie their tie and things like that. Yeah. I was talking to someone who knew him, actually, in Toronto earlier this week. And they said, you know, he was—he was this really great. Like, the research was really good, and the teaching was really good, and his students really liked him. Everybody who knows him from that period in his life is like, "Oh, you were a really great psychology professor, but you are probably not psychologically suited to be an internet commentator." Some people just have hides of inch-thick leather and that sort of thing bounces off of them. But clearly he's somebody who really takes criticism to heart, and it affects him quite deeply. And he's really not cut out for sprawling with people on the internet. Can I ask before—and I promise we'll get to Musk and then I'll let you get on with your day, or tea, or whatever you people are doing in England now—curtsying— —my crumpets —as you drive by… In your previous book Difficult Women, which is excellent—I'm a big fan of kind of second-wave feminism, which now gets read out of context. You read women like Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, and they're read out of context. Obviously, she shouldn't have shot Andy Warhol. She should have shot Norman Mailer if she understood her own theory. That would've been great. But what I'm saying is, second-wave feminism from the late '60s and early '70s often gets read in a void. So it just seems like these shrieking harpies who are talking about castrating men, etc., and it's always taken out of context. Like, yeah, they were denied entry into universities or jobs, etc. One of the figures you've talked about a fair amount is Germaine Greer. Talking about Norman Mailer—I mean, if you ever watch the live debate, she just rocks. She throws her fox fur stole over her shoulder and starts talking about building cathedrals in this über-academic way. I mean, it's… oh, I love it. Yeah. No—I mean, you could power all the energy needs of the developing world with the sexual tension… It is really quite something. Germaine Greer, does she fall into a problem of—she was hot, she had a moment. Do you think her thought isn't on a hot streak anymore? It's kind of a amazing because she helped define, certainly in England, second-wave feminism, and now she seems to be hated by most feminists. How does genius age? Oh, I don't think that's true in Britain, where she lived most of all—I mean, she's originally Australian. I think because of the transgender revolt of the last 10 years, she became very unfashionable with the people who came of age at that time. She was seen as being insufficiently inclusive of transgender women. But I think in Britain, the scales have tipped back toward—whatever you want to call it—sex realism, gender-critical feminism. People are now also rediscovering their love of Germaine Greer's brutal, radical honesty, I think we might call it. Personally, my favorite Germaine is not "Why I think naked boys are attractive" Germaine—that was a strange Germaine—nor even the Germaine of The Whole Woman or The Female Eunuch. But her writing on art criticism—she wrote a book about female painters called The Obstacle Race, which I read when I was revising this. As a scholar I think she's got another one called something like Kissing the Rod, which is about Restoration poetry. It's a very Germaine Greer title. She was an exceptional close reader of texts and paintings. And I wonder, actually, when the outrage about her comparing trans women to spaniels has all died down—we will remember the quality of her thoughts. In the same way that people now appreciate—you mentioned Valerie Solanas, but I'm thinking more of Andrea Dworkin. Penguin has just reissued all of Andrea Dworkin's work. Because it's now been long enough that people have kind of gotten over themselves about her controversies and remembered the interesting contributions that she made. But this comes exactly to what the whole book is about, which is: all of that depends on a generation of women—my age or below—who want to remember her, who want to keep enshrining her. This idea of history as a process—you know, we want to keep her memory and what she wrote alive. That's ultimately where the historical judgment comes from. It's whether or not the next generation thinks you're important. It seems to me that Britain has more—you know, and I use this term with air quotes—"TERFs" than American feminism. I think America maybe has a lot of… If you want to define it like this—80 percent of America thinks that sex matters and that there is a difference between trans women and women. Right? But those are none of— Yeah—none of that implies a different legal standing or anything like that. I have struggled. There's a tradition of French feminism, which is its own thing, and then Anglo-American feminism. I found it interesting, I guess, that there are very few American feminists who are on a Germaine Greer level—who exist and are talking publicly about this. Do you have a quick gloss on why it seems like second-wave feminism stuck around longer in England than it did in America? I think it's probably because of the trade union movement and the left feminist movement. Whereas in America, things became much more polarized. And also I think that in America, because abortion dominated the conversation for so long—and continues to dominate it—everybody gets sucked into that. There isn't a lot of space for other stuff. Plus, stuff like employment law being so much more federal in America—what are the kind of big…? And again, in America, race has been such a big part of the conversation for so much longer. I mean, Britain is now a much more diverse country than it was. But in the '90s, it was still 95 percent white. These are just much more recent questions about whether or not feminism is, quote, "white." In 1920, that wasn't a question in British feminism because everybody was white. Whereas it was a huge deal in America. So I think all of those social factors might account for it. I was just thinking as you were talking about England being blessedly white even into the 1990s. Whoa, whoa, whoa—I didn't say that! I was going to say—if you're looking for supplementary material for the eventual paperback edition of this, it would be great to look at Eric Clapton as a genius who then went on to a bit of racial… Very Shockley. A very Shockley trajectory. Like, "Oh, so you loved 'Layla'? Would you also like to hear my thoughts on race?" No—just play "Layla" again. That was really great. And he also has a few thoughts on COVID. I'm sure John Lennon would have had his few thoughts on COVID, I'm just saying. Well, yeah. This is where I think John Lydon—or Johnny Rotten—is kind of… he's a very stable genius, because whatever is dominant thinking, he will be on the other side of it at any given moment in time. But let's talk about Musk quickly. He's not the controlling metaphor of your book, but he is the controlling genius of our moment. Do you think his recent foray into politics—does that tarnish him? Because I was thinking: there's a science writer based in Canada named Dan Gardner. He has a fabulous Substack called Past, Present, Future, or something like that. He wrote a lot about Henry Ford. And he was like, "Hey, I want to tell you a story about a carmaker who really kind of blew his reputation by talking about stuff he didn't really know anything about." And it's about Henry Ford, who was a great genius at mass production and all of this kind of stuff. And then he got bored running a car company, and he's like, "OK, I'm going to solve World War I." And didn't he become a massive antisemite? Oh, he was. He is the Bob Dylan of antisemites. I don't know who's the ultimate Jew. He went electric. Yes, absolutely. And then he also ended up suing people who libeled him for describing him accurately, and then losing status in public court hearings. Because he's an idiot about all of this kind of stuff. Where does that story go? Because he is the epitome of galaxy brain. It's like: he's good at these things, so every thought he has is good, and we have to put up with him. You know, he was working for an administration where people want to have more kids and be Christian. We don't know how many children he has—virtually none of them in a marriage setting. He's divorced, and increasingly it's not even clear how many there are or under what circumstances they were born. That's one thing people tolerate—because he's good at making money and making cars. But then this political foray, where he's going back to Texas—is that the type of thing that destroys his geniusness, or does it remain to be seen? I mean, I think it does. How I've always felt about it is: SpaceX, which is the truly innovative business—if it manages to make reusable rockets work in that way that drives down the cost of space travel, that allows us to become an interplanetary species—I would have thought, in 400 years' time, we're not going to be talking about his bad tweets. But at the current rate, I think he deeply risks falling into that Shockley pattern—of somebody whose juice kind of runs out. Because look at the DOGE as we're talking, he's just been giving this round of kind of exit interviews complaining it was a lot harder than he thought it would be. And you know how he could have found out how hard it would have been? He could have asked me—an idiot—to tell him that. The fact is, governments are harder to run than private businesses, because you can't have creative destruction. You can't just let a government fail and someone else move in—people die, people don't get their Social Security checks. These are important things. But instead, he trampled through that undergrowth like a huge rhino, insistent that he knew best. And—shock horror—if he'd gone into that with his undoubted skills, but had learned more first, he would have been more successful at it. Well, from a Reason angle, it was frustrating, because there are people who work at Reason—but also there's a whole Gulag Archipelago of think tanks—of people who have said, "This is how you cut government spending and waste," etc. And, like, there are almost off-the-shelf plans you can bring in as opposed to going in and not succeeding. Ones that are increasingly picking up traction on the left, right? If you look at the whole abundance agenda—a lot of that is really saying, places like California don't work because they overregulate. What's that phrase of Ezra Klein's? "Everything bagel liberalism"—where it's like, "Why don't we make this housing project also solve racism and wild birds?" So there's definitely a libertarian critique that people feel government is slow and sclerotic. And a more humble man might have read those things first. The point with Musk is that—I guess this is part of where geniuses go to destroy themselves—they really don't think that, as your book argues—and I think it's completely persuasive—that breakthrough technologies are never the result of one person. But when you get exalted like that, then you stop looking around for the expertise or the team that will actually help you produce results. Then you're looking for yes men, or people who will… Your circle becomes—you become Kanye West or something, where nobody around you is going to say no. Yeah. And I think the really interesting examples of that—Picasso and Einstein are probably our most obvious examples. Most people's go-to ideas of artistic and scientific genius. But Einstein never really accepts quantum mechanics. So when he dies, he's more a celebrity than the kind of person in the field that young physicists look to. And Picasso similarly doesn't go to pure abstraction—he doesn't end up in the place of Rothko. That's because they had their paradigm shift. They had the moment where they were the perfect brain to meet the moment. And I think you probably see something very similar with Musk. He had a playbook—which, if you read Character Limit, the book about his takeover of Twitter—you know, he brings in his lieutenants, they lock everybody out of the systems, they fire everyone and rehire that they need. He just had this way that had worked for him in the past. And he went, "Bring on big balls, I'm going to do that to the government too." And he didn't realize that it was not the same environment, and that his one thing that had worked before would now not serve him anymore. And that, to me, exactly is what you're saying. It's a classic genius myth: you think, "I've got the answer," not realizing that different questions have different answers. Right. Yeah—and to go back to that idea of domain-specific intelligence or expertise: not everything is like everything else. That was one of the great myths in American capitalism in the mid-20th century that was destroyed—the idea that all businesses, regardless of what you produce, can be managed by a set of professional managers who are trained in management. And it turns out shipbuilding is very different from oil production, which is different from newspapers, and all of that. If I may—are there good examples of geniuses who run into the wall that Musk has driven his Tesla into with Dogecoin and everything—who then come back? Are there Paul McCartneys, whose second truth or last two-thirds of a career are actually as good or as interesting as the first third? That's a really good question. And I'll probably have to give it more thought than I'm able to on the hoof, because— I'll tell you what—I can't think of any examples offhand, but as you're saying that, I can totally see what a great story that is. And how much people would love that story. So there probably are examples of it. I'm thinking of the kid who was the actor in Indiana Jones who then didn't really do anything for ages and then won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once. People love that idea that this is the ultimate comeback story. So I can see that happening, where someone had been piddling away for a while and then came back with something. But I don't know. The best versions, I think, of people are your McCartneys or your Springsteens—or, you know, I went to see the Pixies last week. People who just carry on doing something because they clearly love it, the fans love it, and they enjoy it. And the Pixies gig was very interesting, because clearly people were there to hear the songs primarily from Surfer Rosa, their 1980s album. And they play those quite happily. Then they play some of their new stuff too. And I just thought: this is quite a good acknowledgment of: this was the moment we were hottest. We're not in that moment now. But we don't hate those people or resent that. We love that it happened. We're not sad that it didn't go on forever. That is fascinating. Yeah, I started my career as a teen magazine and rock music journalist. And there's nothing worse than bands or artists who hate the work that made them famous. It's an awful life. It's sad, isn't it? It's really sad. It is. And there are people—I'm thinking of someone like Nick Cave or Bob Dylan. They're very different, but Dylan refused to go away. He goes through cycles where stuff starts to make sense, even if it seems horrible the first time. And Cave has certainly been growing as an artist. And someone like Madonna—I think she stopped, in a way, but had a fantastic run. Can I just real quickly do a bit of biography? Because you mention at one point—and I thought this was fascinating in the book—that your father, in the '50s, took one of these inscrutable-to-Americans O-levels or A-levels, or whatever. I've read a ton of Beatles biographies, and they're always talking about how "I ruined my A-levels," and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's not easy to understand—like SATs. Yeah, no, of course—which is its own kind of bullshit. But your father did well on a test, and that meant that he got to go to university. What is your background, and how did you get to be where you're at? So the test you're talking about is the Eleven-Plus, which kids took at the age of 11. At the time—this is after… so my parents were both born in 1945—so this is in the aftermath of the Second World War. The idea was, if you came from a working-class family—and any other kind of family—that they were going to try and make higher-level education more accessible to a greater number of people. But the way to do that was by selecting viability. So you took this test at 11, and if you passed it, you went to a grammar school. If you didn't, you went to what was called a secondary modern or a technical school. The idea was that you either had an academic education or a vocational one based around going into trades. Because at 11—come on—the bread is baked, right? Well, that's a big… I mean, we mentioned Lewis Terman a long time ago. He also, earlier than that, thought that you could kind of pick future winners very early. And that's not always possible. The other thing it did was create—you know, you'll hear people today will say, "the Eleven-Plus was amazing because I got chances that I wouldn't otherwise got." But that's a kind of survivorship bias, because you don't hear as much from the people whose lives were ruined by being told at 11 they were not good enough. But in his case, it meant he was the first in his family to go to university. He went to Aston University in Birmingham to study chemistry. He worked first for Worcester Porcelain—where I grew up, which has its own delightful porcelain—and then for a place that made things you melt steel in—crucibles. Sorry, I know you're loving how much of an English stereotype I am, aren't you? Yeah. "It has a delightful bone china—from the Potteries." But you know, he benefited—definitely—he got lifted up like that. And on my mum's side, my granddad, who was Scottish, he was a coal miner. He moved south and took civil service exams as an adult. So he was the engine, he moved from working class to middle class, at that point. My mum then went to the same school I ended up going to, which was a convent school, a Catholic school. So I came from a really nice, normal middle-class high school. This was in the Midlands in England. I didn't know anybody who was a journalist. I didn't know anybody who lived in London. Even Birmingham was quite exciting to me. So I do have to remind myself every so often: if I could go back and talk to 16-year-old me about what I do and who I know, she would be pretty impressed. It is kind of fascinating, isn't it? There's a version of this in the U.S.—and I think throughout the West, and even much of the developing world—where tests, whether they're IQ tests or aptitude tests, they're used in many ways to reinforce the status quo or to naturalize it. But oftentimes, the goal—even when they were implemented—was not necessarily to do that, but to be more egalitarian and more meritocratic. Intelligence needs to be contextualized, and things like that. You know… Well, it's not necessarily a bad impulse, is it? Because actually, the signature event in my academic career was that I went to Oxford University, and that was determined— I said… A little place, yeah, in the Cotswolds. But that wasn't determined by a test for English—that was determined by an interview. And you know what? That obviously privileges eloquent bullshitters. The die was cast in my future in podcasting, because that's exactly what that selects for. Tests are bad in some ways, but they're also sort of… they're the worst thing apart from all the other things. We haven't yet invented a way of designing education that weeds out bias. The Eleven-Plus was notoriously problematic because it was easier for middle-class kids to pass it. They had more knowledge. Often just flat-out their parents hired tutors to get them through it. Now what happens is that there are very few grammar schools left, and the house prices around them are exceptionally high. So you end up with class sorting by who can afford to buy a house in that area. I mean, that's… to talk about the abundance agenda. And I always think when I hear about Ezra Klein, I'm like: If you want to read what Ezra Klein is going to write tomorrow, read what Reason was publishing 20 years ago. But part of it is—when it comes to educational opportunity and whatnot—the idea that, well, there are only 10 universities. So we have to sort to get the right people into that. It's like, maybe you create a world where there are many, many different universities—or more schooling opportunities—rather than funneling people through. In America, there was starting to retreat—not necessarily for good reasons—but there was this birth of gifted and talented programs. And most of the time, it wasn't just like, "If you hit this level of testing, you'll be in the gifted and talented program." It's like, "We only have a certain number of slots." And, well—if the test says you're gifted and talented, why don't you expand the program? But oftentimes, the function of schooling is not to increase opportunity, but to maintain the existing power structure. That's my idea. No, I know. And there's loads of stuff that happens like that. The Ivy Leagues, which excluded or limited Jewish students in the first half of the 20th century, they did that by saying, "We want to look at well-rounded students." Or they moved their recruitment pools out of New York City and into the outer boroughs—or whatever it might be. That's the only way I think T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound got into Ivy League schools—because they were from Missouri and Idaho. So they benefited from the geographical quota. But this is one of the big themes of the book: a level of humility about the systems we have and whether or not they are free from bias. And when the things that look natural and inevitable to us are actually the result of things we can't see—because, yeah, there are a lot of invisible hands. And actually, sometimes, extremely visible hands, if you care to look for them. Yeah, the Ivy Leagues now have a different way of keeping Jews off campus, right? So they—you know, it's more visible. This is not the first time that America's had debates about affirmative action. It just used to be that the affirmative action was in favor of WASPs in the 1920s. Yes, and I'm glad to live in a post-WASP America, for the most part. Just a final question about your method. Have you ever been called a genius? Hm. Why? One of the things that I find remarkable in your work—both the podcasting but then the writing work. I always take this as a sign of an excellent journalist—and I don't really care about "geniuses" is that you find a topic and then report out on it. And that way, you don't have to worry about a hot streak or a cold streak, because the onus isn't on you to be a genius all the time or to come up with new and novel things to say. You go out into the world and see what's happening. That seems to me that's a very rare model for journalism—but it obviously seems like the best way to do it. It's a great relief to just be like, "I am not actually that interesting. What I do is, I go and put myself in interesting places and meet interesting people—and I will tell you about them." And like you say, I'm surprised more people don't do it, because it's a huge burden off you. If you're not trying to be the main character in your drama—if you're content to be the amanuensis at the side—then yeah, it's a huge weight off your shoulders. And I think this is what drives a lot of modern journalists kind of mad: if you're only telling a story in which you're the protagonist, then you need to keep doing stuff. And actually, just go and talk to other people. Other people are mad. They say crazy things. That's Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his collection The New Journalism, which was about stuff from the '60s and early '70s, published in the early '70s. He said that, "it was amazing. So many weird things were happening in America, and all you had to do was go out and hang out with people." He's seen as someone who's a genius—he has genius insights and is a stylist—but he says in plain sight:" just go and talk to people who are doing things you think are interesting." And you are interesting. It's also just the most fun. I mean, there's nothing that makes me happier than being in some random bit of backstreet America, just talking to people whose life experiences are completely different from mine. And I wish more people got the opportunity to do it, to be honest. The color that you add to, you know, talking about going to—or witnessing—one of the SpaceX launches or recoveries is brilliant. You know, because it's out in the world. It's wonderful. I have kept you overlong—I apologize for that. Where are the best places people should look for your work? You can find most of it through my Substack, which is helenlewis.substack.com. And also my longer, more considered work is at The Atlantic, who are very kind in giving me—the thing that I really like about working for them is that they invest in you as a person. And like you say, reporting is the best and most fun thing to do. And it's not the easiest thing to do in journalism at the moment. So I give them huge credit for letting me—letting me be my best self. God, that sounded like therapy. Sorry—what a hateful note to end on. I'm going to go and have, like, a muffin and a crumpet and be overly British. Yeah, maybe talk about Princess Diana and how sad it is. Are you up on the royals? Do you like the royals? Oh, yeah. I know. There was a time during the Prince Harry saga where I was threatening to become The Atlantic's royal correspondent, just because I enjoy writing about them. And by God, do Americans love reading about them. I don't understand that. And I think Harry was best when he was following in—was it Edward VII or VIII?—when he was doing the Nazi costumes. I was going to say, "being a Nazi." It's all been downhill for him since then. Helen Lewis, thank you so much. It was a real delight talking to you. The Genius Myth is a spectacular book. It's the best thing you've written recently—until the next one. So thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Title: NYSE: ELV DEADLINE REMINDER: Berger Montague Reminds Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) Investors of Important Class Action Lawsuit Deadline

June 04, 2025 10:52 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, June 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world

The effort to protect the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade was long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development NEW YORK -- Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration's recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. "We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez's organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It's now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country's agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID's adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden's administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings "are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” ___ This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Ripple Boss Brad Garlinghouse Denies Pursuing Deal To Acquire Stablecoin Giant Circle

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified that his crypto powerhouse never pursued the acquisition of major stablecoin issuer Circle. The statement, which was made during a Las Vegas event, comes after reports claimed that Ripple reportedly offered between $4 billion and $5 billion to purchase Circle. Speaking to Georgetown Law professor Chris Brummer, Ripple asserted that the company was not exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. “Brad was unequivocal — Ripple never pursued an acquisition of Circle. And while he wished the company well, it wasn’t something he was considering,” Brummer revealed in a June 3 post on X, citing a discussion he had onstage at the Ripple Las Vegas conference “48 hours ago.” The session was not broadcast live. Bloomberg was the first to report that Ripple tried to purchase Circle, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low. America’s leading crypto exchange, Coinbase, allegedly made a counterbid. Sources also told Fortune that Circle would sell to Coinbase “in a heartbeat” given their longstanding relationship. Founded in 2013, Circle is a major company in the crypto industry, known as the issuer of USDC, the industry’s second-largest stablecoin by market cap after Tether’s USDT. As ZyCrypto previously covered, the reports of Ripple’s potential takeover of Circle were met with a mixed reaction within the cryptosphere. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson, for instance, suggested that the deal, if successful, could “make the space better.” Meanwhile, MetaLeX Labs founder Gabriel Shapiro speculated that it could lead to a “crypto apocalypse.” “Making Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,” Shapiro had explained at the time. According to a recent SEC filing, Circle is seeking a fully diluted valuation of up to $7.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO). The company will sell up to 32 million shares priced between $27 and $28 each. Circle’s IPO is attracting significant interest from market participants, with the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, reportedly planning to purchase roughly 10% of the offering.

Title: Bitcoin Could Replace Dollar As World’s Reserve Currency Amid Ballooning US Debt Crisis, Coinbase CEO Posits

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicted that Bitcoin might “take over” as the world’s next reserve currency if Congress doesn’t tackle rising national debt quickly. With America’s national debt sitting comfortably around the $37 trillion mark, Armstrong is warning that the burden could one day be the reason the dollar is dethroned by the premier crypto as the reserve currency of the world. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world,” the Coinbase boss said in a June 3 post on the X social media platform. “We need to get our finances under control.” If the electorate doesn't hold congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency.I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control. https://t.co/aeBE7pUuHo His worries over the debt crisis came as House Republicans passed President Donald Trump’s so-called “One big, beautiful bill” in May that extends tax cuts, boosts military spending, and cuts Medicaid, food aid, and clean energy. Six Nobel Prize-winning economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, argued in a June letter that the bill’s structural design would increase inequality and add over $3 trillion to the US debt. Fears of inflation and fiscal strain fuel strong interest in Bitcoin, an anti-inflationary asset with a fixed supply. Investors wary of the government’s apparent failure to rein in its spending are preparing for runaway inflation over the long term by pivoting to the top crypto as the safer bet than the dollar. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also slammed the bill on Tuesday, calling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.” Musk collaborated with Trump to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), which triggered controversy due to the agency’s aggressive approach to target various government departments to identify and recommend cost cuts to Trump and Congress. But the wheels have fallen off that initiative. Musk has clarified that he will dedicate most of his time to Tesla, SpaceX, and his other companies from now on. Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong isn’t the only person concerned about what might happen if America runs out of people to buy its soaring debt. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that America’s rising national debt threatens the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, potentially leading to decentralized assets like Bitcoin taking its place. Bitcoin has historically served as a safe haven during economic tumult, such as the pandemic, and could benefit long-term from eroding trust in fiat systems, especially with the US fiscal outlook worsening. Meanwhile, US President Trump has previously floated using Bitcoin to solve the mounting sovereign debt crisis.

(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know

Reporter A street view of a Citibank branch in San Francisco, Calif., on May 13, 2025. Reporter Citigroup has reversed its policy restricting banking services to retail clients selling firearms, ending the practice that was put into place in 2018. In a statement shared on June 3, the bank said that the decision had been made in response to concerns raised over “fair access” to banking services. As a result, Citigroup said it would “no longer have a specific policy as it relates to firearms.” The reversal comes after criticism from President Donald Trump and other conservatives regarding “de-banking,” citing what they believe to be unfair practices from U.S. banks preventing conservatives from using their services. Advertisement Advertisement Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos virtually in January, Trump said: “Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business,” taking aim at U.S. bank CEOs. Here’s what to know about Citigroup’s reversal and how it fits into wider discussions about banks and politics in America. Citigroup outlined the specifics of its previous restrictions, saying: “Our U.S. Commercial Firearms Policy was implemented in 2018 and pertained to sale of firearms by our retail clients and partners. The policy was intended to promote the adoption of best sales practices as prudent risk management and didn’t address the manufacturing of firearms.” Since 2018, Citigroup had restricted its services to retail clients selling firearms, requiring them to adhere to three practices. Under the policy, “new retail sector clients or partners,” clients could not sell firearms to those who hadn’t passed a background check, had to restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21, and could not sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. In its June 3 update, the bank said that after reviewing its policies, it will be updating its "Employee Code of Conduct" and its "customer-facing Global Financial Access Policy," to clearly state that the Citigroup does "not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation." “These changes reinforce our commitment to serve all clients fairly, and we will continue to work with regulators and elected officials on ways to improve transparency and trust in the banking sector,” the statement continued. The banking service introduced new restrictions in March 2018 following a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14 of that year, which left 17 people dead. The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, aged 19 at the time, was able to obtain firearms after a background check, despite previous warning signs. Both Cruz’s age and circumstances were addressed in Citigroup’s firearm policy. Not allowing retailers to sell bump stocks was also included in the bank’s 2018 policy, after the device was used during a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017. A bump stock allows semi-automatic rifles to fire at a higher rate, and were banned by the Trump Administration in December 2018. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down this ban in 2024. After the shooting in Parkland, Florida, investment management firm BlackRock also announced that it would be asking for further details and information on business practices from firearms manufacturers and retailers. In April 2018, Bank of America said that it would be restricting firearms-related business and would stop lending money to manufacturers that make military-inspired weapons to be used by civilians. In particular, Bank of America started to wind down relationships with manufacturers that produced AR-15 style rifles that have been used in mass shootings. In 2024, Bank of America loosened some of its restrictions surrounding lending to the firearms and energy industries, amid pressure from politicians in Texas and Florida. Criticism amongst conservatives and Republicans have long been aimed at banking institutions for imposing restrictions on firearms and other issues. In 2022, a number of conservative-led states considered a number of new bills, with some passing, penalizing banks for such policies. According to Reuters, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs were all sidelined by state law that barred firms from the municipal bond market if they were found to “discriminate” against the firearms industry in the state. In April 2024, over a dozen Republican state attorneys general addressed a letter to The Bank of America, raising their concerns with the bank’s “de-banking policies and practices threaten the company’s financial health, its reputation with customers, our nation’s economy, and the civil liberties of everyday Americans.” Within the letter, Bank of America was criticized for “systemic biases” against political views. The letter cited a report in which the bank is said to have shared a list with the FBI of anyone who had bought a firearm with a credit or debit card from the bank in Washington, D.C., in the days surrounding the Capitol Riots on Jan. 6, 2021. “We are shocked that Bank of America would so cavalierly disregard its customers’ privacy and their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights at the behest of the federal government,” the letter continued. Shortly after his inauguration in January, Trump launched criticism at banks, in particular at the Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking directly to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Trump said: “The Bank of America, they don’t take conservative business… you, Jamie (Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong.” In response, Bank of America said that it “welcomes conservatives” as part of the 70 million customers that it serves. “We would never close accounts for political reasons and don't have a political litmus test,” the bank said in a statement after Trump’s remarks. Elsewhere, the Trump Organization sued Capitol One in March, accusing the bank of closing hundreds of accounts belonging to the company. In its complaint, the Trump Organization said it believes “that Capital One’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views.” The complaint argued that Capitol One’s decision was “part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer’s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution.” Capitol One responded, requesting that the lawsuit be thrown out, and in turn arguing that the Trump Organization’s complaint “fails to provide any factual or legal support for the claims asserted, requiring dismissal on several grounds.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world’s most valuable company again. Nvidia shares are rising nearly 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, after it edged out Microsoft in market cap on Tuesday, closing up nearly 3% to $141.22 and putting the AI chipmaker’s value at $3.444 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap was $3.441 trillion at its close Tuesday. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to occupy the spot as the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. They are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Despite their gains, Nvidia’s market cap is still below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Shares of Nvidia as well as others linked to the AI boom tumbled then when China's DeepSeek released a low-cost model that raised investor concerns about the future dominance of American AI firms. On Tuesday, Jefferies added Nvidia to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” touting the company as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train AI models.

The company said on Wednesday U.S. regulators have asked it about certain transactions as well as the July 19 outage. It earlier forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates, partly due to an incentive program meant to retain customers after the outage. Its shares fell more than 5 per cent in afternoon trading. The program ended in the fourth quarter but continues to weigh on subscription growth, as it let customers pick more products or extend usage. The incentives reduced first-quarter revenue by about $11 million and will have a $10 million to $15 million impact each quarter for the rest of the fiscal year.

Title: Flock’s AI Cameras Are Watching Cars All Over America. They’re About To Get A Lot More Powerful.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/06/04/flocks-ai-cameras-are-watching-cars-all-over-america-theyre-about-to-get-a-lot-more-powerful/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T12:00:53Z
Full Content:
ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster, Forbes Staff. Flock has tens of thousands of cameras operating across almost all American states. It's now giving those devices live streaming capability, making them significantly more powerful. Flock Safety, the $7.5 billion car surveillance company, has already built a sizable AI-powered camera network, with tens of thousands of smart license plate readers monitoring roads in 49 American states. Soon its cameras are going to capture a lot more. In the fall this year, cops will be able to turn their Flock license plate readers into something more akin to traditional surveillance cameras. While Flock cameras today take photos of vehicles, flagging any car that’s on a hotlist of suspected vehicles to cops or private industry customers like FedEx or mall provider Simon Property, those same customers will soon be able to request either live feeds or 15 second clips from around the time a vehicle passed through a camera’s field of vision. Garrett Langley, Flock CEO, told Forbes that the update should give cops more “situational awareness.” Police will be able to pull up feeds from Flock cameras when a 911 call comes in, for instance, Langley said. “We will just open up the five nearest cameras in real time and say, here's what's happening right now,” he said. There will also be the option to upgrade to a camera where the angle can be adjusted, for a wider purview. “If it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.” For years, civil liberties experts have worried about Flock’s expansion. Last week, 404 Media reported that a Texas agency had used it to locate a woman who’d had a self-administered abortion across state lines. Jay Stanley, technology director at the ACLU, fretted that Flock “is trying to build a nationwide authoritarian surveillance system.” Langley, in response to those privacy concerns, said that Flock’s tech was auditable and transparent. It was down to democratically-elected individuals and groups to decide if Flock was right for them and what they do with the data the cameras collect, he said. Flock’s expansion comes on the heels of Axon Enterprise announcing a rival product to Flock’s license plate readers in April. Flock and Axon, a $59 billion market cap publicly traded cop contractor best known for making the Taser, had previously been partners, but in February, the two companies had a very public break up. Axon CEO Rick Smith said at the time that Flock was trying to lock customers into its products by making its software restrictive enough that it didn’t work as effectively with other vendors’ tools. Langley in response claimed it was Axon that had decided to be less collaborative, as evidenced by its decision to stop working with or recommending Flock. Langley told Forbes in an interview last week that he was hoping to challenge Axon’s “monopoly” by building a competitor that the market had been lacking. He claimed agencies he spoke with had become “frustrated with the monopolistic behavior that Axon has exhibited over the years and continues to exhibit, and I think that the beauty of capitalism is that it enables competition when properly enforced.” In response, Axon spokesperson Alex Engel said that Axon was a collaborative business with over 60 technology partners and integrations, which “underscores our commitment to customer choice, interoperability, and transparency.” “Axon's ecosystem is built on the belief that customers should always own and control their data,” Engel added, without mentioning Flock. Flock has been broadening its product offering for police to include drones, gunshot detection and a new software suite called Nova, which draws in information from police databases to make connections between suspects, properties or any other notable aspect of an investigation. That latter tool was built on technology Flock Safety quietly acquired in a previously unreported deal with Lucidus Tech last year. Lucidus was cofounded by former senior staff at Peregrine Technologies, a $2.5 billion startup that offers similar tech to Nova. Langley said that cops can now take information they find from Flock license plate readers and feed it into Nova to ask, for instance, if a car owner has a criminal history or any mental health conditions. For Flock, which raised $275 million earlier this year in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, expansion also means far higher overheads. The latest update to add surveillance camera functionality could increase costs substantially when it comes to storing the video on its Amazon Web Services servers. “If it's heavily, heavily used, it will be quite expensive for us,” Langley said. “But we feel like if it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.”

Title: The FDA Launches Its Generative-AI Tool, Elsa, Ahead Of Schedule
URL: https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-launches-its-generative-ai-tool-elsa-ahead-of-schedule-2000610498
Time Published: 2025-06-04T11:30:34Z

Generative artificial intelligence has found another home in the federal government. On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the early launch of its very own generative AI that it hopes will improve efficiency. The FDA’s toolânicknamed Elsaâis designed to assist employees with everything from scientific reviews to basic operations. Originally, the FDA planned to launch by June 30, so Elsa is well ahead of schedule and under budget, according to an FDA statement. It’s not clear what exact information Elsa was trained on, but the FDA says that it didn’t use any “data submitted by regulated industry” in order to protect sensitive research and information. Currently, Elsa houses its information in GovCloud, an Amazon Web Services product specifically intended for classified information. As a language model, Elsa can help employees with reading, writing, and summarizing. In addition, the FDA said that it can summarize adverse events, generate code for nonclinical applications, and more. Per the agency, Elsa is already being used to “accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets.” In a May press release announcing the completion of the FDA’s first AI-assisted scientific review, Makary said he was “blown away” by Elsa’s capabilities, which “[hold] tremendous promise in accelerating the review time for new therapies”. He added, “We need to value our scientists’ time and reduce the amount of non-productive busywork that has historically consumed much of the review process.” According to one scientist, Jinzhong Liu, the FDA’s generative AI completed tasks in minutes that would otherwise take several days. In Tuesday’s announcement, FDA Chief AI Officer Jeremy Walsh said, “Today marks the dawn of the AI era at the FDA with the release of Elsa, AI is no longer a distant promise but a dynamic force enhancing and optimizing the performance and potential of every employee.” Generative AI can certainly be a useful tool, but every tool has its drawbacks. With AI specifically, there has been an uptick in stories about Â hallucinations which are outright false or misleading claims and statements. Although commonly associated with chatbots like ChatGPT, hallucinations can still pop up in federal AI models, where they can unleash even more chaos. Per IT Veterans, AI hallucinations typically stem from factors like biases in training data or a lack of fact-checking safeguards built into the model itself. Even with those in place, though, IT Veterans cautions that human oversight is “essential to mitigate the risks and ensure the reliability of AI-integrated federal data streams”. Ideally, the FDA has thoroughly considered and taken measures to prevent any mishaps with Elsa’s use. But the expansion of technology that really needs human oversight is always concerning when federal agencies are amidst mass layoffs. At the beginning of April, the FDA laid off 3,500 employees, including scientists and inspection staff (although some layoffs were later reversed). Time will reveal how Elsa ultimately performs. But eventually, the FDA plans to expand its use throughout the agency as it matures. This includes data processing and generative-AI functions to “further support the FDA’s mission.” Artificial intelligenceFDA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: More or less
URL: https://longform.asmartbear.com/more-or-less/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T11:16:48Z
Full Content:
There are three viable strategies in the interplay between value and price: You see this pattern across all industries, in both consumer and business markets. More for more Cardigan by Miu Miu for â¬2,150 In clothing, for example, a cashmere sweater embodies More for moreâexpensive, but deliciously soft (enjoyment) and warm (functional). A high-end brand has a function beyond high-quality materials: Status is bestowed upon the owner, due to it being overpriced beyond its quality. Buyers are not budget-constrained, which enables high prices and correspondingly high profit margins, but customers also have their pick of options, where every other product on the planet is a competitor. The customer is in control. Hence the importance of being âthe bestâ according to some subset of the market. More for less Sweater by L.L. Bean for â¬92 More for less describes the practical decision-making that governs most purchases: Highly functional articles that will last for years, at one-fifth or even one-tenth the price of the same luxury item. Most people have a budget and therefore are seeking âThe best that I can afford.â Thus price is the primary constraint, inside which they prioritize features according to personal preference; they canât have everything, but they can prioritize everything. The productâs goal is not to be the best along every dimension, but rather to offer a set of trade-offs that enough customers prefer over other sets. Less for Less Hoodie by Tamu for â¬7 Fast-fashion vendors provide Less for less, where youâll find the article disintegrated in the washing machine by the end of the season, but hey, it was cheaper than lunch. Consumers arenât choosing between trade-offs, but rather between having a sweater, or having no sweater at all. All negatives are accepted, as there is no alternative. The vendor enjoys a massive market, but rock-bottom prices mandate extreme cost-efficiency, requiring almost non-existent marketing and sales costs, and even in the best case yields barely any profit even at scale. A competitor with a better cost structure can decimate the business. Donât worry about it. All three approaches are valid and, like all strategies, each drags along a set of consequences, some of which you despise, others you love. You must pick one approach, and accept its batch of consequences. If you donât incorporate those consequences into the rest of your strategy, youâll have a confusing market message, a Frankenstein product, and the wrong pricing model. Building âthe bestâ is wonderful for both profit and enjoyment of life. It feels good to have pride in your craft, to have customers who love what you do and agree with your superlative self-assessment. âThe bestâ commands a high price, which makes profit easier, even while self-funding further investment. This is a beautiful place to be, but it comes with consequences. âThe bestâ is not the average of a subset of things that already exist. The best is an outlier. The best is special. The best is different. Your ideas need to be substantially different from whatâs already available, or itâs definitionally not true that youâre the best. So, the first question is: The best at what? It could be anything, but it has to be specific, and customers have to agree itâs worth the higher price tag. It could be the best designâthe simplest, the most pleasant to use, the most beautiful. It could be qualityâthe peace of mind and enjoyment of a product always âjust worksâ. It could be a superior workflow, could be that it integrates with all the tools the customer uses, it could be personal tech support, and more. This article on âWillingness to payâ lists more ways of being âthe bestâ. Coupled with âbest at whatâ is âbest for whom?â There are billions of people on the planet who absolutely do not agree what âbestâ means in clothes, software, food, or articles about pricing strategy. This is where founders get fouled up; they think that just because they love it, and they âbuilt it for myselfâ and therefore âI am the customer,â and therefore other people will also to pay to solve that problem, in that way. They rarely do. The fallacies with that assumption (and some truths), are detailed here. Instead, use your initial spark of insight as the starting point, your motivation, knowing that half of it is indeed correct but half isnât, and so you go find potential customers to interview, and use a structured process to fix your hypotheses to morph your definition of âbestâ into alignment with what some specific ideal customer. Customers in this category care about something even more than they care about price. What kinds of things are like that? In business, an example is so-called âmission-criticalâ things, i.e. a failure or low quality causes outsized damage in internal cost, or far worse, damage to their reputation, in the worst case causing customers to leave.1 Something that is an urgent, top priority for them right now, whether due to emergency or strategic mandate.2 In the consumer world, it could be what Google calls a âtoothbrush productââsomething vital that is used at least twice a day, or ideally all day,3 or tied to personal identity.4 1 Our company WP Engine is an example, because we run websites like eCommerce (all of the customersâ revenue) or media (merely being slow means they lose traffic, which means they lose ad revenue) or corporate home pages (downtime costs lost leads and lower reputation). This can also be CYA, i.e. âno one ever got fired for buying ______â. 2 See this article for many examples of how this arises, and how to define your target customer and product to match. 3 Examples: to-do apps for busy people, email for people who spend more than an hour per day there, calendar apps for people whose calendars look like they only barely lost a game of Tetris, note-taking apps for people with 1000s of notes 4 Like luxury brands, where being âfar too expensiveâ is the point, like a ram with ridiculous horns. Being âthe bestâ isnât just about the product or the customer-fit; all other decisions must also be aligned with that positioning. Your marketing will focus on excellence and exclusivity rather than affordability. Your team will likely be smaller with higher-caliber individualsâpassionate artisans who take pride in creating excellence and celebrate perfectionism. When hiring, youâll focus on finding the top 1% of talent, often paying premium salaries. Your customer support isnât measured in hours but minutes, often with white-glove, personalized service and dedicated account representatives. Your product development cycles may be slower, emphasizing perfection before launch, developing features without cutting corners regardless of cost. Because the number of customers in the market is small and limited, market-share matters, and upgrading existing customers is vital for growth at scale.5 5 Many public enterprise software companies get the majority of their revenue growth from up-selling existing customers, rather than adding new ones. Fortunately, the high price tag means you can invest in these things. And if you pull it off, itâs the best for yourself because youâre fulfilled when youâre exercising your best qualities and youâre validated when others agree on Twitter and say it to your face. You can recruit great employees, because who doesnât want to work at a company whose customers actually love them? Most products are not âthe bestâ. But for those who can deliver it, it creates a virtuous cycle of excellence, satisfaction, and profitability thatâs hard to beat. Efficiency is beautiful. âMore for lessâ means receiving outsized value for a given cost. It is the right value proposition for most things in life, especially in business where you need to get a job done as cheaply as possible, but not cheaper. The global apparel industry exemplifies the claim that this is the most popular category. The âmore for lessâ category generates $1,200B of the industryâs total $1,600B annual revenue, with luxury at $250B and fast-fashion at $150B. With profit margins of 5%-15%,6 they are unsurprisingly more profitable than fast-fashion (under 5%)7 and less than luxury (20%-30%).8 âMore for lessâ software companies can have much better profit margins than apparel; coupled with reasonable prices and addressing the largest market segment, this is a great business model. 6 L.L. Bean, makers of the sweater above, is private and doesnât report profit, so this range is based on their 10% annual spend on bonuses and give-back activity and data from other retailers. 7 The outlier-most-profitable fast-fashion brand stands at 9%, but almost all are under 5%. 8 For example Prada, which makes the Miu Miu sweater above, generates 23% net profit. Which types of product benefit from high-efficiency, but doesnât require âthe best?â Perhaps almost anything. Back-end systems that operate the company but are invisible to customer are a good start, because no competitive advantage is conveyed to the company for getting âthe best.â Even more ideally, areas where downtime isnât terribly disruptive to their real-time operations; a reporting system can be down for an hour without hurting their business, but a customer support tool cannot. Or an area where itâs OK if not every desired feature is present, again like reporting software where the lack of exactly the right chart-type is not a deal-breaker, and wonât prevent them from seeing the data. Even better when the product just needs to âtick a boxâ to âsay that we have it,â because then requirements wonât be stringent. It might sound negative that your product isnât âcritical to their successâ, but being non-real-time, non-essential, also means you have far more leniency in quality or lack of features. This leniency in requirements is also why you will make 100x more sales than you expect, even though you still target the âperfectâ ideal customer with marketing and product features. For your ideal customer, you are in fact âthe best,â and they cannot believe theyâre getting the âMore for moreâ product for the âMore for lessâ price. That attitude defines them as the ideal customer; if you canât win them over from your home page, youâre not doing your job. But, for every one of those, thereâs a hundred others where youâre the right choice. You have most of what they want, you donât have any deal-breakers, and the price is right, so youâve made the sale. So, you gain the power of specificity, clarity, and emotional connection from talking to your ideal customer, while winning all the âMore for lessâ customers anyway. This article on ICPs explains this dynamic in detail, with examples. Although the main value here is economy, âsave moneyâ is weak positioning. Position by showing how much value youâre generating rather than how much money youâre saving as described in this article on positioning for value. Because, even if this is your pricing strategy, that doesnât mean itâs your marketing material. Your marketing position still needs to be as strong as possible, emphasizing that it really is more for less. As with the other pricing strategies, the rest of your decisions must be aligned. Marketing will make the customer feel like this is the âsmart choice,â neither wasting money on useless branding nor falling prey to the mistake of âIf you think this is expensive, wait until you see how expensive âcheapâ is.â Marketing must make the trade-offs clear, not try to claim itâs the best for everyone, which quietly alienates everyone; comparison charts shouldnât be a solid column of green checkmarks, but rather elucidate where you are strong, and where you are not the right solution. Product features must not be too difficult to maintain, as the price tag doesnât allow for special exceptions or for brittle integrations that only 5% of the customers use. Rather, build only those features used by at least 50% of customers, or where at least 15% of customers buy you specifically for that reason. Hire team members who excel at identifying and eliminating waste without sacrificing core value. Your whole business must reflect the âMore for lessâ mentality; your internal costs and decisions match your external promises. Pundits have long eschewed the âMore for lessâ strategy as a poor compromise between being either âthe bestâ or âthe cheapest.â As Michael Porter famously wrote in Competitive Strategy (1980), there are only three strategies: (a) Differentiated Best; (b) Low-Cost Leader; (c) Niche Leader. Later thinkers pointed out that (a) and (c) are the same, differing only in market-scope. This leaves the Porter model with what I am calling âMore for moreâ and âLess for less.â However, the customers have spoken, and in most consumer and business industries, it is in fact the âMore for lessâ category that wins most of the customers and most of the revenue and most of the profits. We must not fall prey to the incorrect attitude that this is âa balanceâ between value and cost; we should instead recognize that âMore for lessâ is a third, independent strategy, and leverage its strengths to the fullest. They say ânever compete on priceâ, but as the linked article demonstrates, that statement is incorrect. There are many wildly successful companies, from solo bootstrappers to some of the largest and most-profitable companies in the world,9 who became successful due to absolute rock-bottom prices, even though those products come with severe trade-offs that many consumers would not accept. Sometimes, âcheapestâ is âbestâ. It may seem like âless for lessâ couldnât be a good strategy, because neither employees nor consumers ought to be happy with âless,â and low prices means low revenue, which in turns means little money for marketing, sales, development, support, product, design, or fun company-culture stuff around the office.10 All that is true, and are among the consequences we accept when we adopt this strategy, but the hundreds of billions of dollars of profit (to say nothing of revenue) generated by the many âless for lessâ successes prove that these trade-offs are sometimes the right ones. 9 Examples: Amazon, Walmart, Vanguard, Costco, Dollar General, IKEA, Southwest Airlines, H&M, Zara, Xiaomi, ALDI 10 Or whatever virtual-office-substitute weâre pretending has the same effect as human beings being beings together. When something is surprisingly cheap, customers are not surprised that they have to compromise on most dimensions, such as quality, design, convenience, features, service, appearance, or longevity. Sure, itâs missing some obvious features. Sure, it doesnât integrate with Enterprise systems. Sure, customer service is going to be a set of knowledge-based articles. Sure, it sometimes crashes. What did you expect for $5 per month? There are billions of people who will buy $5 clothes that barely survive the season. If I pay $2/month for web hosting and I get email and a website, itâs okay if the email gets some spam and the website is not always fast or even always working. And I donât expect the clothing retailer to have customer service or accept returns, and I donât expect tech support from that web host to know anything beyond helping me reset my password. The fundamental reason a customer will accept a wide range of trade-offs is that the alternative is to not have the product at all. That is, the choice is between having any hoodie versus having no hoodie. The product is âbinaryâ in this senseâhaving versus not-havingâthanks to an accessible price tag. One does not quibble over âfeaturesâ or âqualityâ or âserviceâ when the alternative is ânothingâ. This is at once empoweringâsupplying goods to people who otherwise had no accessâand depressingâthat so many people cannot afford the comforts invented through modern ingenuity. And so we generate the worst versions of those items for most of the world to âenjoy.â Which viewpoint is correct? The answer can often be found in the mission and purpose behind the companyâthe real one, not the one written by the marketing department on the âAbout Usâ pageâwhere the fundamental driver of the company is either one of empowerment and impact, or one that exploits desperation. Regardless, the company should extol the positive aspects in branding and positioning: Emphasizing democratization, participation, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. The hardest part of executing this strategy is being profitable, since thereâs so little revenue to be profitable with. The costs have to be extraordinarily, unconventionally low. Some of that can come with scale, either directly (e.g. bulk-purchases from suppliers) or structurally (e.g. tech support per customer is lower at 100,000 customers than at 100, simply because most of them donât have a question in any given month). Still, it takes a lot of $2/mo customers before you can afford to hire even a single tech support person. Or if winning a customer means winning $2/mo and maybe $50 across the entire lifetime of that customer, you canât afford to pay very much to acquire that customer, whether thatâs in direct advertising spend, or sharing revenue with an influencer,11 or indirect so-called âorganicâ marketing,12 and you certainly canât have a sales team. You must rely on word-of-mouth and reviews from customers; youâll need to encourage it. 11 Affiliates are paid only after you are paid, which means this is an affordable form of marketing from the start. 12 While harder to get customers at first, when pages arenât ranked in Google and social media accounts arenât followed by anyone, those assets do scale over time. Given that revenue will significantly lag costs, is it mandatory that such a company raise money? The company will certainly consume cash for a while, whether thatâs in the form of someoneâs savings, friends-and-family, a loan, or indeed raising money. Annual billing can help quite a bit. This is why pundits (including me) are always telling bootstrappers to âraise their pricesâ or, since you now know that prices are coupled with every other strategic decision in the company: âswitch from a âless for lessâ strategy to either âmore for lessâ or âmore for more.ââ If you donât want to raise money, donât build a business that burns money on purpose. However, itâs not true that such business need to raise an exorbitant amount of money. In fact, in the same article above, every one of the four case studies (which each grew to multiple-billion dollars in revenue) raised only a small amount of money. Those stories are detailed in the article. When the strategic decisions are fully aligned to a low-cost operation, you only need enough starter cash to get going. This is where VC-funded companies often get it wrong; they assume âwe can work the costs out later,â but when âlaterâ comes, they realize their processes, technology, and culture has solidified around whatever worked for acquiring customers, and change is either impossible or dramatically painful, like layoffs, rewriting the code that works, and trying to force unnatural marketing and sales motions. There are also examples of bootstrapped companies using this strategy who never raised money; they typically have some extreme cost advantage, such as being located in a country with extremely low costs, yet selling to the United States and Europe. Being physically located in a low-cost zone is a competitive advantage that companies in The West cannot match. As usual, what doesnât work is having a low price without the rest of the strategic decisions. This constantly happens with inexperienced founders who think: âMy product sucks, so Iâm not comfortable charging a lot.â Thatâs not a good reason, and you shouldnât just build crappy product. Instead, the question should be: How do I build a simple yet lovable product that some specific ideal customer would pay 10x more than Iâm currently charging, even though it doesnât have a lot of features, and sometimes doesnât even work? Thatâs exactly what I did with WP Engine. While the hardest intrinsic challenge is to be profitable, the hardest external challenge is that a competitor can beat you with lower prices alone. And this is all too easy, because thereâs so many reasons why a competitor might win: The antidote is to constantly increase your cost-efficiency, and possibly proactively lower prices. This is what Amazon did in retail and later did in the cloud.14 13 A particularly ironic example: Microsoft killed Netscape by putting over a thousand developers on Internet Explorer and releasing it for free; more than a decade later, Google killed Explorer by putting over a thousand developers on Chrome and releasing it for free. 14 Amazon knew from their âyour margin is my opportunityâ strategy in retail, they should proactively reduce prices as their cloud operations scaled, to prevent people from looking for alternatives. Later, when Microsoft and Google were established as the only two serious competitors, they all stopped lowering prices simultaneously. Surely a coincidence? âLess for lessâ is brutal, because of relentless competition and having no extra money to work with. But, it means accessing the largest number of potential customers, and in the best case, you are truly enriching the world by bringing goods and services to people who otherwise could not afford to enjoy them. All three pricing strategies are validâeach boasts wildly successful companies of all sizes, in every country. Ideally, one of these strategies jumps out at you as the smartest one, or at least the one youâd be the most excited and proud to implement. Another might jump out as being dumb, or at least too difficult, not worth the consequences, not where you want to spend your precious, irreplaceable time on this Earth. Listen to your gut. Because all are, in fact, smart strategies, you should pick the one that best matches your personal strengths and proclivities, because thatâs the one you will execute the best while being most fulfilled. This is another choice that increases your chance of success. The only wrong choice is to not choose at all, and thus be confusing to customers and misaligned with the rest of your strategy. Then you will make internally-inconsistent choices, working against yourself, and your customers wonât know how to think about your product, which means they wonât be comfortable buying it. And then your product is the right choice for no one. â

Title: This CEO collected almost $165 million last year — more than the boss of Apple or Blackstone

The best-paid CEO last year was not running a technology giant or a Wall Street firm — but the company that makes Tasers. Rick Smith, the CEO and cofounder of Axon Enterprise, which makes stun guns used by many police forces, took home almost $165 million last year. Although Smith's annual salary was $31,201, he was awarded stock options worth just over $164 million after meeting a series of targets over several years. He told The Wall Street Journal that the stock award came from a scheme open to all Axon employees that lets them convert salary into stock options, whose value depends on the share price performance. "It creates that startup kind of vibe," said Smith, who has been CEO of Axon since 1993. Axon stock is up more than a fifth over the past month after posting strong first-quarter results. The price has soared more than 700% over the past five years, leaving the company worth almost $60 billion. Smith's compensation exceeded the total for better-known S&P 500 businesses such as Starbucks or Apple, per data compiled by public company intelligence platform MyLogIQ. Second on its list was new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who collected a $5 million bonus and stock awards worth about $90 million. Larry Culp, CEO of GE Aerospace, was third on $89 million, followed by Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman on $84 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook collected nearly $75 million last year, including a salary of $3 million and a stock award worth $58 million, putting him in fifth place. Other names on MyLogIQ's top 20 include KKR co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall ($73 million and $64 million respectively); Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters (almost $62 million and $60 million); and Salesforce's Marc Benioff on $55 million. A study by Equilar and The Associated Press found that in 2023, the pay of CEOs in the S&P 500 rose by 12.6% year-on-year. Axon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Pension Funds Have Had It With Tesla’s Board And Musk
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/06/04/pension-funds-have-had-it-with-teslas-board-and-musk/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByAlan Ohnsman ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. When Elon Musk appeared in the White House last week at a ceremony with President Donald Trump marking the end of his controversial role leading the federal job-slashing DOGE initiative, he sported a shiner on his right eye that he claimed came from toddler son X. That literal black eye will heal, but the figurative ones Tesla and Musk’s reputation have received from his political activities are likely to linger. Some of Tesla’s biggest shareholders — including unions like the American Federation of Teachers, whose 1.8 million members participate in pension funds with $4 trillion of assets under management, including $8.8 billion of Tesla shares — see one group as largely to blame: the EV company’s board. “People don't like Elon Musk,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told Forbes. “We've taken the position over the course of the last few months of: ‘Do your job board. Do your job financial industry. Do the job you're supposed to do, which is the governance of Tesla.’” “Make sure he’s there or get another CEO” Weingarten and the teacher’s union have been pushing fiduciary officers overseeing major state and city pension funds, as well as investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and TIAA, to review their Tesla holdings and pressure the board to change its ways. “We don't want Tesla to fail because if Tesla fails that means a lot of retirees are going to lose a lot of money in terms of their portfolios,” Weingarten said. She added: “If you're going to have Musk there, then make sure he's there. Don't have him do these extracurricular activities. Make sure he’s there or get another CEO.” Nine state treasurers and comptrollers sent a letter to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in April raising concerns about risks to their economies if the company falters because of poor board governance. “No other publicly traded company CEO would've been allowed to neglect his day-to-day duties like Musk has. No exception,” said Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who signed the letter. “And if they had undertaken personal activities that hurt the reputation of a company or brand that badly, would they be treated like he has been?” CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund representing public workers in California, had no specific comment on Tesla and said its investments are “are index-oriented and optimized using systematic and quantitative investment strategies, not driven by any single period’s events.” However, it sold 4.5 million Tesla shares in the third quarter of 2024. The fund held about 9.4 million Tesla shares as of its last annual filing, a stake worth $3.2 billion as of June 3. Tesla fell 2.9% to $332.05 on Wednesday. The shares are down about 18% this year. Musk for years has divided his time as Tesla chief with leadership roles at SpaceX, X, The Boring Co., Neuralink and xAI, but his Trump administration job proved particularly harmful to the brand, spurring protests at Tesla stores and vandalism of its vehicles and facilities. A poll conducted by Washington-based GBAO last month found that Musk was viewed unfavorably by 55% of the 2,000 Americans it surveyed, while Tesla ranked as the least favored brand among poll participants who have or are considering getting an electric vehicle. Most importantly, 51% of survey respondents said they’d view Tesla more favorably if the world’s wealthiest human were replaced as CEO. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” Musk has now said he’s stepped back from his DOGE duties and Tesla stock has rallied in the past few weeks, jumping more than 50% since April 21, as many investors appear hopeful he’ll be more engaged in leading the company, particularly as it prepares to launch a pilot robotaxi program in Austin this month. He’s even shown signs of breaking with Trump, labeling the the president’s so-called Big Beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday because of how much it increases the federal deficit. GBAO GBAO Principal Margie Omero, who oversaw the Musk-Tesla survey, isn’t sure the billionaire’s latest moves will make a difference. “He may say he's stepping away but his involvement with Trump, both in helping to elect him and in helping enact Trump's wishes in government, all those things are not going to change. They’re not over,” she said. Pollster GBAO focuses mainly on progressive issues and notes that Tesla’s core customer base and EV buyers generally tend to identify as Democrats. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” “Tesla's brand has suffered dramatically alongside Elon Musk's brand–in some ways they’re one and the same,” said Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, also a signatory to the April letter to board chair Denholm. Maryland’s State Retirement Agency currently has about $175 million invested in Tesla through pooled accounts. “As somebody who keeps an eye on the returns of our retirement portfolio and our investments, I am always looking to make sure that our retirees and their hard-earned retirement dollars are invested wisely–and with companies governed by boards we can trust and who are engaged in responsible business practices,” Lierman said. GBAO Musk’s behavior and unrestrained comments on social issues have persisted for years, from his false claim in 2018 that he’d lined up funding to take Tesla private. The same year he called a critic “pedo guy” and had to go to court to defend his comments in a defamation trial because of it. During a 2020 earnings call meltdown, he decried emergency public health rules at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as “fascist.” More recently, he gave what looked like a Nazi-style salute at a Trump victory rally, and in February wildly waved a chainsaw around onstage at a conservative political conference. Recent and detailed reports of his use of drugs including ketamine and Adderall haven’t helped. Denholm didn’t respond to a request for comment. Weingarten, Frerichs and Lierman said they’ve had no response from Tesla’s board from their letters. Weingarten said AFT is weighing potential legal action against Tesla’s board, though hasn’t made a final decision on the matter. Musk “has done huge damage to the Tesla brand and Tesla’s reputation,” she said. “If boards are not going to do their job, outside pension funds, including advocates of them, are going to try to force these boards to do their jobs.”

Title: How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 01: In this photo illustration, the logo of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting recent trading activity and investor sentiment, on June 01, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) saw its stock fall about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday, June 3, despite reporting better-than-expected Q1 earnings. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 on sales of $1.10 billion, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.65 earnings per share on the same sales figure. CrowdStrike’s positive Q1 performance was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. CrowdStrike anticipates Q2 earnings of $0.82 per share on revenue of around $1.14 billion. This forecast fell short of street expectations, which projected $0.81 in earnings per share but $1.16 billion in revenue. Additionally, while Q1 revenue increased nearly 20%, the company’s adjusted operating margin plunged 500 basis points year-over-year to 18%, amid increased costs for its professional services business and higher R&D spending. On a more positive note, CrowdStrike raised its full-year earnings guidance, now expecting $3.44 to $3.56 in adjusted earnings per share, which is above the consensus of $3.43. However, it maintained its sales outlook of $4.74 billion to $4.81 billion, aligning with the consensus of $4.77 billion. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program. Given the upbeat Q1 results, raised full-year earnings guidance, and the share buyback program, the stock’s decline might seem puzzling. However, investors appear to be reacting to more than just the minor Q2 revenue forecast miss. CrowdStrike’s stock has surged a remarkable 40% this year, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 index's 2% rise. Trading at lofty valuations, even a slight miss on the revenue forecast was enough to unsettle investors. Now, the critical question is if CRWD stock is a buy at levels of $460. We answer this question here – Is CRWD Stock Overvalued At $460? – based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Remember, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock or even a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Yes, we think so. Trading at a whopping 122 times its adjusted trailing earnings, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a security software company, looks expensive. Sure, the company’s growth has remained impressive lately. But the important question is whether this valuation is justified. And we don’t think it is. Our conclusion is based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike, across key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, reveals a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Now, to reduce stock specific risk, consider taking a look at the Trefis High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Also, see – How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1? CrowdStrike’s valuation appears significantly higher than the broader market, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio standing at 28.1 - well above the S&P 500’s 3.2. Our dashboard on CrowdStrike’s valuation ratios has more details. This high valuation comes despite the company demonstrating extremely strong top-line growth in recent years. Over the last three years, CrowdStrike’s revenue has expanded at an average rate of 40%, far exceeding the S&P 500’s 6.3%. Also, revenues grew 20% to $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, outperforming the S&P 500’s growth rate. Regarding profitability, CrowdStrike’s reported operating income over the last twelve months was -$252 million, resulting in a negative operating margin of -6.1%, which is worse than most companies. However, on an adjusted basis, its operating margin was a healthy 20.3% for the same period. Adjusted operating income excludes stock-based compensation and certain one-time items such as acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring costs. The company also shows strong cash generation, with an operating cash flow of $1.4 billion, leading to a high operating cash flow-to-sales ratio of 33.4%, significantly better than the S&P 500's 15.7%. CrowdStrike’s financial stability is very strong. With a debt of $785 million against a market capitalization of $122 billion, its debt-to-equity ratio is a very low 0.6%, indicating minimal reliance on debt compared to the S&P 500’s 19.0%. Furthermore, cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 billion make up 53% of its total assets, highlighting a robust cash-to-assets ratio compared to the S&P 500's 14.8%. Despite its strong growth and financial health, CRWD stock has shown weakness during market downturns. During the 2022 Inflation Shock, the stock fell 58.3%, a steeper decline than the S&P 500’s 25.4%. Similarly, during the 2020 Covid pandemic, it dropped 50.0% compared to the S&P 500’s 33.9%. While the stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peaks in both instances, its greater volatility suggests weaker resilience during market crashes. In summary, CrowdStrike shows strong performance across key financial metrics, and its profitability is good on an adjusted basis. We believe this positive performance is already reflected in the current stock price of $460, given its very high valuation. The stock trades at 28 times its trailing revenues and a significant 122 times its trailing adjusted earnings of $3.73 per share, which is much higher than its three-year average price-to-earnings ratio of about 80x. Furthermore, there’s a risk of a broader market downturn, which historically has impacted CrowdStrike’s stock more severely than the general market. Also, the growth is slowing. The consensus estimates project average sales growth of 21% over the next couple of years, compared to 40% average growth seen in the last three years. Considering these factors, we do not think now is a good time to buy CRWD stock. Investors would likely benefit from waiting for a further price dip. Surely, we could be wrong. There’s a chance investors might continue to value CRWD highly if sales grow faster than expected. But, the risk at the current valuation appears high. In fact, the risk assessment framework is something we focus on while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What's Happening With JPMorgan Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2025/05/15: Sign at the entrance to the JP Morgan Wealth ... More Management building in Midtown Manhattan. (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has seen an increase of approximately 11% year-to-date, in comparison to the 1% rise in the S&P 500 index during the same timeframe. In contrast, JPMorgan's competitor Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has risen by 6% over the same duration. So, what has contributed to the strong performance of JPMorgan stock? The banking giant exceeded Wall Street expectations in the first quarter of FY 2025. Revenue for the quarter climbed 8% to $46.01 billion, driven by stronger asset management and investment banking fees, along with solid trading outcomes. Trading revenue was especially remarkable, increasing 48% to $3.8 billion. Net income rose by 9% to $14.6 billion, or $5.07 a share. The bank's asset management division has also performed well because of heightened asset prices. Assets under management jumped 15% year-over-year to $4.1 trillion. Furthermore, if you're looking for upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception. That being said, the bank has adopted a cautious stance regarding its outlook due to geopolitical factors, the U.S. imposition of tariffs on trading partners, and worries about inflation. These inflation concerns have led to an increase in treasury yields, with the 10-year yield standing at over 4.40%, up from 4.01% in early April, while the yield on the 30-year bond is just beneath 5%. This situation could have a mixed impact on JPMorgan. Increased rates and market volatility might negatively affect the investment banking sector, as they typically cause delays in IPO listings, mergers, and acquisition activities. However, from a lending perspective, higher yields expand the margin between what banks earn on loans and what they pay on deposits, which generally enhances net interest income and profitability, although there could be some effect on credit quality. Additionally, market volatility could partially be mitigated by the company’s strength in its trading operations. Currently, JPM stock is trading at approximately $265 per share, or about 2.6 times its tangible book value. Although this makes the bank appear expensive relative to its peers, this could be partially justified by its strong capital position, superior credit quality, and proactive risk management strategies, which may enable it to perform better in the current environment. JPM has also been intensifying its capital returns program. Over the last quarter, the bank repurchased $7 billion in common stock and announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. We estimate the value of JPM stock at around $240 per share, slightly beneath the current market price.

UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan discusses the significance of President Donald Trump’s visit, trade deals and more on ‘Special Report.’ President Donald Trump’s recent visit to the UAE marked a pivotal moment for UAE-U.S. bilateral relations, shining a spotlight on a shared vision for the future. As the UAE and the "New Gulf" pivot from oil to cutting-edge technologies, our partnership with the U.S., rooted in decades of trust, has become a beacon of what’s possible when nations collaborate. This trust has paved the way for a bold new chapter: a strategic economic alliance poised to create tens of thousands of high-tech, energy and manufacturing jobs, driving prosperity in both of our countries. At the heart of this collaboration lies the new U.S.-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership.

Title: The hidden time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs

Time Published: 2025-06-04T09:00:00Z

For the past two years, it’s been a ghost in the machine of American tech. Between 2022 and today, a little-noticed tweak to the U.S. tax code has quietly rewired the financial logic of how American companies invest in research and development. Outside of CFO and accounting circles, almost no one knew it existed. “I work on these tax write-offs and still hadn’t heard about this,” a chief operating officer at a private-equity-backed tech company told Quartz. “It’s just been so weirdly silent.” Still, the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision — buried deep in the 2017 tax law — has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off, according to industry tallies. Headlines have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic and, more recently, AI. But beneath the surface was a hidden accelerant: a change to what’s known as Section 174 that helped gut in-house software and product development teams everywhere from tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) to much smaller, private, direct-to-consumer and other internet-first companies. Now, as a bipartisan effort to repeal the Section 174 change moves through Congress, bigger questions are surfacing: How did a single line in the tax code help trigger a tsunami of mass layoffs? And why did no one see it coming? For almost 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of qualified research and development spending in the year they incurred the costs. Salaries, software, contractor payments — if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it came off the top of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was guaranteed by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. Microsoft was founded in 1975. Apple (AAPL) launched its first computer in 1976. Google (GOOGL) incorporated in 1998. Facebook opened to the general public in 2006. All these companies, now among the most valuable in the world, developed their earliest products — programming tools, hardware, search engines — under a tax system that rewarded building now, not later. The subsequent rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and mobile apps also happened in an America where companies could immediately write off their investments in engineering, infrastructure, and experimentation. It was a baseline assumption — innovation and risk-taking subsidized by the tax code — that shaped how founders operated and how investors made decisions. In turn, tech companies largely built their products in the U.S. Microsoft’s operating systems were coded in Washington state. Apple’s early hardware and software teams were in California. Google’s search engine was born at Stanford and scaled from Mountain View. Facebook’s entire social architecture was developed in Menlo Park. The deduction directly incentivized keeping R&D close to home, rewarding companies for investing in American workers, engineers, and infrastructure. That’s what makes the politics of Section 174 so revealing. For all the rhetoric about bringing jobs back and making things in America, the first Trump administration’s major tax bill arguably helped accomplish the opposite. When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% — a massive revenue loss on paper for the federal government. To make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers needed to offset the cost. So they added future tax hikes that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174 — from immediate expensing of R&D to mandatory amortization, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods — was that kind of provision. It didn’t start affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative scoring. The delay wasn’t a technical necessity. It was a political tactic. Such moves are common in tax legislation. Phase-ins and delayed provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits — scores legislation, pushing costs or revenue losses outside official forecasting windows. And so, on schedule in 2022, the change to Section 174 went into effect. Companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules in early 2023. And suddenly, R&D wasn’t a full, immediate write-off anymore. The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. To understand the impact, imagine a personal tax code change that allowed you to deduct 100% of your biggest source of expenses, and that becoming a 20% deduction. For cash-strapped companies, especially those not yet profitable, the result was a painful tax bill just as venture funding dried up and interest rates soared. It’s no coincidence that Meta announced its “Year of Efficiency” immediately after the Section 174 change took effect. Ditto Microsoft laying off 10,000 employees in January 2023 despite strong earnings, or Google parent Alphabet cutting 12,000 jobs around the same time. Amazon (AMZN) also laid off almost 30,000 people, with cuts focused not just on logistics but on Alexa and internal cloud tools — precisely the kinds of projects that would have once qualified as immediately deductible R&D. Salesforce (CRM) eliminated 10% of its staff, or 8,000 people, including entire product teams. In public, companies blamed bloat and AI. But inside boardrooms, spreadsheets were telling a quieter story. And MD&A notes — management’s notes on the numbers — buried deep in 10-K filings recorded the change, too. R&D had become more expensive to carry. Headcount, the leading R&D expense across the tech industry, was the easiest thing to cut. In its 2023 annual report, Meta described salaries as its single biggest R&D expense. Between the first and second years that the Section 174 change began affecting tax returns, Meta cut its total workforce by almost 25%. Over the same period, Microsoft reduced its global headcount by about 7%, with cuts concentrated in product-facing, engineering-heavy roles. Smaller companies without the fortress-like balance sheets of Big Tech have arguably been hit even harder. Twilio (TWLO) slashed 22% of its workforce in 2023 alone. Shopify (SHOP) (headquartered in Canada but with much of its R&D teams in the U.S.) cut almost 30% of staff in 2022 and 2023. Coinbase (COIN) reduced headcount by 36% across a pair of brutal restructuring waves. Since going into effect, the provision has hit at the very heart of America’s economic growth engine: the tech sector. By market cap, tech giants dominate the S&P 500, with the “Magnificent 7” alone accounting for more than a third of the index’s total value. Workforce numbers tell a similar story, with tech employing millions of Americans directly and supporting the employment of tens of millions more. As measured by GDP, capital-T tech contributes about 10% of national output. It’s not just that tech layoffs were large, it’s that they were massively disproportionate. Across the broader U.S. economy, job cuts hovered around in low single digits across most sectors. But in tech, entire divisions vanished, with a whopping 60% jump in layoffs between 2022 and 2023. Some cuts reflected real inefficiencies — a response to over-hiring during the zero-interest rate boom. At the same time, many of the roles eliminated were in R&D, product, and engineering, precisely the kind of functions that had once benefitted from generous tax treatment under Section 174. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms — basically every company you recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads — built their growth models around a kind of engineered break-even. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. But the Section 174 change broke that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, the tax shield vanished. Companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first growth collapsed overnight. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave like tech companies. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside the capital-T tech sector. This lines up with OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies ran with that logic. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Add that to core tech’s contribution, and the Section 174 shift has likely touched at least 20% of the U.S. economy. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue effectively hid a time bomb inside the growth engines of thousands of companies. And when it detonated, it kneecapped the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America look irrational on a spreadsheet. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to repeal the Section 174 change, with business groups, CFOs, crypto executives, and venture capitalists lobbying hard for retroactive relief. But the politics are messy. Fixing 174 would mean handing a tax break to the same companies many voters in both parties see as symbols of corporate excess. Any repeal would also come too late for the hundreds of thousands of workers already laid off. And of course, the losses don’t stop at Meta’s or Google’s campus gates. They ripple out. When high-paid tech workers disappear, so do the lunch orders. The house tours. The contract gigs. The spending habits that sustain entire urban economies and thousands of other jobs. Sandwich artists. Rideshare drivers. Realtors. Personal trainers. House cleaners. In tech-heavy cities, the fallout runs deep — and it’s still unfolding. Washington is now poised to pass a second Trump tax bill — one packed with more obscure provisions, more delayed impacts, more quiet redistribution. And it comes as analysts are only just beginning to understand the real-world effects of the last round. The Section 174 change “significantly increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, potentially stifling economic growth and reducing the United States’ competitiveness on the global stage,” according to the tax consulting firm KBKG. Whether the U.S. will reverse course — or simply adapt to a new normal — remains to be seen. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Best crypto to buy as Truth Social files for a Spot Bitcoin ETF
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/best-crypto-to-buy-as-truth-social-files-for-bitcoin-etf/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T08:43:50Z

In a surprising move that sent ripples through the crypto market, Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has officially filed to launch a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing, submitted through the parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), marks a notable pivot into digital assets, suggesting growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. The development has sparked renewed enthusiasm among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, with meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe also riding the wave of attention and experiencing a surge in investor interest. According to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), TMTG aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and investor demand by offering a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin contracts, a spot ETF would directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors exposure to real BTC prices without needing to manage a digital wallet. The move places Truth Social in the company of major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who launched similar products earlier this year. However, TMTG’s entrance into the ETF space is particularly notable given its political backing and its predominantly conservative user base, potentially opening up Bitcoin exposure to a new demographic of retail investors. The filing is already leading to increased speculation in altcoins, especially high-potential meme coins such as Bitcoin Pepe, as traders look for ways to ride the momentum. While the ETF filing directly concerns Bitcoin, its ripple effect is being felt across the broader crypto market – especially in the meme coin segment. Historically, meme coins thrive during periods of heightened mainstream attention and speculation. The association of Donald Trump’s brand with a financial product tied to crypto reintroduces an entertainment and political angle that energizes retail participation. As capital flows into Bitcoin via ETFs, retail investors often seek cheaper, higher-upside alternatives – and meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe are prime candidates. The political spectacle, media buzz, and renewed focus on crypto could create the perfect storm for meme coin rallies in the coming months. In the sea of meme coins that have flooded the crypto market this year, Bitcoin Pepe is a standout since it has raised more than $13 million during the presale, indicating strong interest in its utter commitment to instant transactions and ultra-low fees. Plus, Bitcoin Pepe is now only 13 days away from a CEX listing that typically leads to a new wave of demand, which often results in significant price increase. With Bitcoin’s visibility rising due to Truth Social’s ETF ambitions, meme coins tied to Bitcoin’s branding – like Bitcoin Pepe – are also gaining traction. As a hybrid of two cultural forces in crypto (Bitcoin and the iconic Pepe meme), Bitcoin Pepe offers strong viral potential, particularly among Gen Z and meme-savvy traders.

More Info Texas has removed BlackRock from its list of oil and gas investment boycotters after the asset manager shrank its ESG footprint, ending a three-year quiet confrontation that saw Texas state investment vehicles pull billions out of BlackRock. “I am pleased to announce a significant decline in the number of investment funds that boycott the oil and gas industry, as well as the removal of BlackRock Inc. from the Comptroller's office list of companies that boycott energy companies,” Texas State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement. “Directly related to our listing process, BlackRock has stepped back from full participation in the Climate Action 100+ and completely exited the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. It has dramatically reduced the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas, and it shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future,” Hager also said. The saga began back in 2022, when Texas passed legislation forbidding state agencies from investing in any of a number of companies that, the state’s government said, boycotted the oil and gas industry. The black list of such companies included many Wall Street heavyweights eager to get a piece of the energy transition business. BlacRock was among the most prominent entities featured on the list. The asset manager protested its inclusion in the list, saying it has investments in the oil and gas industry and no plans to quit these. The firm noted $120 billion in investments in Texas public energy companies, out of a total of $320 billion in energy investments globally. Nevertheless, the Texas Permanent School Fund withdrew some $8.5 billion in investments from the fund manager last year. BlackRock, by the way, is not the only one quitting various net-zero alliances, at least in part as a result of the pressure campaign of conservative U.S. state governments against the anti-oil and gas shift, but also in response to constantly tightening reporting and emission-tracking requirements originating within these alliances.

Title: Bitcoin Moves With Gold And M2 Money Supply – Next Rally Loading?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-moves-with-gold-and-m2-money-supply-next-rally-loading/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T08:00:15Z

Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly mirroring gold’s historic price performance and the trajectory of the global M2 money supply, prompting crypto analysts to forecast a potential major rally for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Jelle shared the following chart that reveals a recurring pattern – gold tends to lead Bitcoin, which subsequently “catches up” in price action. This relationship underscores the growing perception of BTC as digital gold. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements have aligned with those of gold, driven by similar macroeconomic dynamics such as inflation, expansive monetary policy, and investor demand for scarce assets. As gold continues to rally amid rising global liquidity and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin appears to be following suit. Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value is also gaining traction among institutions. Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, recently described BTC as a “superior alternative” to gold – a strong endorsement from the world’s largest asset manager. Meanwhile, another analyst, CryptoGoos, drew attention to BTC’s tendency to follow shifts in the global M2 money supply. He noted that Bitcoin often lags behind increases in M2 by roughly two months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may soon witness another rally. For the uninitiated, the global M2 money supply refers to the total amount of money circulating in the economy, including cash, checking deposits, and other similar monetary instruments. An increase in M2 often signals monetary expansion, which can lead to inflation and push investors toward assets like gold and Bitcoin as hedges. From a technical perspective, BTC is also showing bullish signs. In an X post today, seasoned analyst Titan of Crypto pointed out that Bitcoin has formed a golden cross on the four-hour chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average (MA), typically the 50-day MA, crosses above a long-term average, such as the 200-day MA. The golden cross is widely regarded as a bullish indicator and may signal further upside. Various metrics suggest that the BTC rally is far from over yet. For instance, Titan of Crypto recently stated that BTC is following the Golden Ratio Multiplier, targeting $130,000. Similarly, crypto enthusiast KillaXBT predicted a BTC price of $120,000 by mid-June. However, there are some risks to monitor to avoid getting caught up in a price crash. Analysts caution that if Bitcoin falls below the critical support range of $97,000 – $99,000, it could trigger a sharper correction. At press time, BTC trades at $106,610, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Over three-fourths of India’s listed public sector enterprises do not have the requisite number of independent directors, as these companies continue to wait for clearance from various government departments. As many as 62 out of 79 listed PSUs lack the mandated number of independent directors, according to data from Prime Database. Despite repeated regulatory reminders, these companies await clearances from their respective ministries, delaying crucial appointments and inviting penalties from stock exchanges. Government-owned firms, including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp, State Bank of India, National Aluminium Company Ltd. and Steel Authority of India Ltd, did not have the minimum number of independent directors as of 2 June, according to Prime Database, a Mumbai-based market data tracking firm. The list of non-compliant PSUs includes banks, oil and gas companies, metals and mining firms, power utilities, telecommunications, railways, and engineering firms. According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing regulations, at least one-third of a listed entity's board members must comprise independent directors. Additionally, if the chairman is an executive director, at least half of the board must consist of independent directors. Also Read: HPCL gets new chief, four more large PSUs in queue Boardroom bottlenecksThere are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels. Additionally, 14 of the listed PSUs are yet to appoint a single woman director, despite gender diversity requirements, according to Prime Database. “It’s ironic that we are asking all private sector companies to comply with these requirements when government-owned companies themselves are non-compliant," said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database. With PSUs failing to comply with the market regulator’s rules, many have been fined by stock exchanges. Last week, National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) was fined ₹33.32 lakh for having only three independent directors—two short of the required five—on its 10-member board. A spokesperson for Nalco said the company was continuously following up with the ministry of mines, its administrative ministry, for the appointment of the requisite number of independent directors. The bottleneck lies in the approval process across various ministries, according to proxy advisory firms. “The Prime Minister’s Office should send a strong message to all concerned ministries and PSU companies that they need to be compliant, as non-compliance by PSUs doesn't send the right message to investors," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm. “For instance, when the government, as a major shareholder, is involved in abusive transactions or there is trouble with key management, independent directors are the custodians of minority shareholders’ interests," Subramanian said. Also Read: India's PSU banks outshine private peers in arresting bad loans Many of the largest money managers, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have voiced their concerns when these companies have sought shareholder approval for the appointment of directors, according to voting disclosures reviewed by Mint. In August last year, Hindustan Aeronautics sought shareholder approval for the appointment of former chairman C.B. Ananthakrishnan. Nearly a fourth of public institutions opposed the decision. “Nominee serves as chair of the board and bears responsibility for lack of independence. Nominee is an executive director on the audit committee," noted BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion in assets under management. In the same month, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. sought shareholders’ approval for the appointment of Pankaj Kumar as a director, but 28.35% of public institutions, including Vanguard, opposed his re-appointment. "There has been an expectation that the exchanges or Sebi will act, more so given the repeat violations, but neither has been able to address this issue," said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. "The solution may be to move these entities out of the control of the administrative ministry and into a direct fund that will focus on governance and value creation," he said Despite these lapses, investor interest in PSUs has surged. The BSE PSU Index, which comprises 63 companies, has outperformed the Sensex over the last five years. The index has gained 301% between 5 June 2020 and 3 June 2025, while the Sensex has risen by 135.5% during this period. There are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels. Additionally, 14 of the listed PSUs are yet to appoint a single woman director, despite gender diversity requirements, according to Prime Database. “It’s ironic that we are asking all private sector companies to comply with these requirements when government-owned companies themselves are non-compliant," said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database. With PSUs failing to comply with the market regulator’s rules, many have been fined by stock exchanges.

Title: Bitcoin ‘Going To Take Over’—Tesla CEO Elon Musk Backs Shock $40 Trillion U.S. Dollar Collapse Warning Amid Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/05 update below. This post was originally published on June 04 Bitcoin has surged over the last year, propelled higher by Wall Street’s embrace of crypto and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (despite Google revealing a serious BlackRock bitcoin nightmare just got a lot worse). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price set a new all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin last month, surging 50% from its April low and helped by U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as the Covid-era meme stock craze turns to bitcoin, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has restarted his campaign against out-of-control U.S. government spending, backing a warning that bitcoin could “take over” from the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has reposted a wild bitcoin prediction following the huge bitcoin ... More price rally. “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X in comments reposted by Musk. “I love bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” 06/05 update: Elon Musk’s endorsement of Armstrong’s warning comes at a time of increased pressure on the U.S. dollar, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the U.S. dollar will fall to levels not see since the Covid pandemic this year, pushed down by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the rise of rival currencies. "We think rates and currency markets have embarked on sizeable trends that will be sustained — taking the US dollar much lower and yields curves much steeper — after two years of swing trading within wide ranges," the strategists wrote in a note seen by Business Insider, adding they expect the dollar to fall 9% over the next 12 months to a value of 91 on the dollar index. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has added to fears, predicting spiraling U.S. debt may create a "tough time" for the bond market as spreads widen. "If people decide that the U.S. dollar isn’t the place to be, you could see credit spreads gap out; that would be quite a problem," Dimon said during an interview with Fox Business. “It does feel like we’re entering into a more secular downturn for the dollar,” Peter Vassallo, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management who focuses on currencies, told MarketWatch. “The worst-case scenarios surrounding tariffs have been reduced. But the broad ideas around U.S. policy being more volatile and more hostile to foreign trade — that hasn’t gone away.” Musk, who last year embarked on a campaign against spiraling U.S. debt while supporting U.S. president Donald Trump’s second bid for the White House, has come out against Trump’s signature tax bill just days after leaving his role in Trump’s administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the U.S.’s $36 trillion in debt over the next decade, taking it to an eye-watering $40 trillion. "I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore," Musk, who set up and led the Doge department of government efficiency, posted to X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk wrote that those who voted for it “know you did wrong," and added in a follow up post that it “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” Huge government spending through Covid lockdowns turbo-charged U.S. debt, leading to warnings the Federal Reserve will have to step in to prop up bond markets, devaluing the dollar and potentially spiking inflation. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rocketed to a fresh all-time high in May, soaring as fears swirl over the health ... More of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, a scarce digital asset that’s often compared to gold, has seen its price rocket higher as countries around the world, and led by the U.S., fuel their economic growth with debt. Companies are beginning to shift their corporate treasuries to bitcoin, a trend started by ailing software company MicroStrategy in 2020 that’s propelled it into the Nasdaq 100 and been copied by dozens of companies. “As the U.S. dollar continues to devalue, we’re going to see this shift happening more and more as investors scramble to protect their assets,” Nic Puckrin, bitcoin and crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “With bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 for 20 days and counting, it’s fast becoming the new safe haven.”

Title: Ethereum’s big moment: Why institutions are betting big on ETH

BlackRock and Fidelity are rotating out of Bitcoin and betting on Ethereum! Ethereum [ETH] is having a moment — and institutions know it. Capital is rotating fast, with giants like BlackRock and Fidelity quietly trimming their Bitcoin [BTC] positions and loading up on ETH. It’s a strategic move, likely in anticipation of long-awaited ETH staking approval. At the same time, social sentiment is buzzing, and whale activity is picking up, all pointing to a market mood that’s increasingly pro-Ethereum… even as some big holders are still underwater. Institutions are making their play, and it’s not Bitcoin they’re betting on! On the 2nd of June alone, BlackRock and Fidelity unloaded a combined $180 million in BTC, as shown in the latest ETF net inflow data. Where did that capital go? Straight into Ethereum. Source: SoSoValue Reports suggest nearly 30,000 ETH — valued around $78 million — were scooped up by the same players. The shift is clear: Institutional capital is front-running a potential ETH staking approval, rotating aggressively into what’s increasingly seen as the future of digital assets. According to Santiment data, for every bearish post on ETH, there are three bullish ones, reflecting a euphoric tone among traders. Source: Santiment In contrast, Bitcoin’s ratio is a modest 1.3:1, suggesting a more cautious outlook. The divergence in mood shows growing confidence in Ethereum’s near-term potential, especially amid ETH staking approval rumors. As the crypto crowd leans into optimism for ETH, the gap in sentiment between the two leading assets continues to widen. Even whales aren’t immune to losses, but their moves still matter. A prominent Ethereum whale, who accumulated over 13,478 ETH ($49M) between December 2024 and January 2025, has recently started offloading ETH to Binance, sending 10,000 ETH ($24.55M) in the last two weeks alone. Source: X Despite a $15.66M loss, the whale still holds 3,478 ETH; suggesting a planned move, not panic. It reflects how big players are repositioning ahead of possible ETH staking approval.

Steve Jones, 2025-06-04 I've been reading an interesting book that looks at some of the ways that we can better build software in enterprises. One of the side notes in the book is that the tech companies have the funding and the ability to disrupt many other types of businesses, not just technology. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have delved into other types of industries, potentially pushing others out. We see Amazon becoming as much a shipping and logistics company as they are a retailer. There was a unionization vote, which passed in 2022. Recently, another one failed. Amazon continues to fight these efforts, trying to prevent workers from collectively negotiating the terms of their employment. I've wondered in the past if tech workers would ever unionize. In general, we are paid well and have lots of options for work. There has often been no shortage of opportunities for talented workers, though this year is proving tough for our industry. There are lots of people out of work and struggling to find new jobs. While I'm sure some would prefer a union that might better protect them from layoffs, many tech workers are against the idea. There is a growing number of tech workers looking to unionize. Inside Google, there is a union for some workers, but not all. That's unusual, as often all workers in a category are part of a union at a company. To gain employment, you need to join the union. I don't know if I'd want to join a union. I've had lots of success and haven't seen the need, but I do know that I've also seen lots of other tech workers pressured and pushed to work long hours, to skip vacations, and other practices that are good for the employer, but not so good for the employee. I've seen many people not know how to negotiate with employers, and perhaps a union would benefit most people. Would you want to be part of a data professionals' union? It might give some security and more benefits for many, though not quite as much pay as you might otherwise receive. Maybe more than you get now, as it depends on where you sit in the salary scale at your company. Let me know what you think about unions today.

The company behind the second-largest USD-pegged stablecoin by market cap is naming its price for its upcoming US initial public offering (IPO). According to a Reuters report, USDC-issuer Circle says it is aiming for a $7.2 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO – about $28 per share – partially because of the current administration’s friendlier outlook on crypto regulations. US dollar-pegged stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. Tether’s USDT is the largest USD-pegged stablecoin by market value. Says Chief Investment Officer of Running Point Capital, Michael Ashley Schulman, “Issues regarding memecoin hype and more specifically Trump’s ventures into a namesake coin should not directly affect the outlook for stablecoins backed by hard currency.” According to the widely followed pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse, the Circle IPO valuation is “cheap.” “Circle IPO seems interesting to me. I think $28 is going to look cheap over a multi-month period. Outside of the initial event volume, I will be looking for price to develop a clean range and ideally start to establish a longer-term position.” Bloomberg reports that BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, plans on accumulating 10% of Circle’s shares when they become available on Thursday, June 5. BlackRock is already the acting reserve manager for the assets backing USDC. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

June 03, 2025 17:07 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, June 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025. DoubleVerify operates a software platform for digital media measurement and advertising optimization services. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (DV) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.

Title: The Best Gifts for an Amazing Host, According to a Party Girl With Taste

Time Published: 2025-06-03T20:46:45Z

Filed under: Whether you’ve been invited to a dinner party or to stay the week at a Joshua Tree compound, your host deserves a token of appreciation — and here are 39 impeccable ideas If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. Dear guest of someone else’s home: I hope you didn’t show up empty-handed. Bringing a host or hostess gift isn’t just chic; it’s good manners! Now, different situations (and different hosts or hostesses) call for different gifts, from earnest to cheeky, casual to Very Special. A three-day weekend at someone’s recently renovated Joshua Tree compound merits something a little more premeditated than a $20 bottle of wine; for an intimate evening of takeout, couch rotting, and watching The Rehearsal finale, perhaps a box of Japanese incense matches will do the trick. Here’s the thing: Everyone wants to go to a party — well, maybe not those Gen Z professional bed-rotters on TikToks who just want to remain horizontal and scroll, but most of us — yet being a host can be burdensome. I speak from experience as someone who throws at least two relatively decadent gatherings a year; it’s expensive and exhausting, although I’d argue that it’s (almost) always worth it, even if a recycled glass Champagne flute or a stolen pint glass from The Commodore inevitably gets shattered on the floor every time… simply a sacrifice to the party gods. If you’ve been invited to a party, detach your eyeballs from the infinite scroll and go make some memories! Don’t just huff and puff about being late, missing all the mini lobster rolls, or having to stay longer than you’d like to avoid an exorbitant Uber fee; devote a little thought to how your lovely friend or family member put in an undoubtedly Herculean amount of effort (and likely quite a bit of money) to ensure that you, fabulous guest, have a damn good time or else. They built a dirty martini fountain; they made cucumber tea sandwiches; they wiped countertops and bought extra seltzer, all in the name of your amusement and pleasure. Maybe this person isn’t just hosting you in their home for a few hours, but as an overnight guest for a night or three (or longer — maybe you’re staying with someone for two months while your divorce proceedings get sorted, for instance). In these contexts, when you might unwind on their premises, disrupt their daily routine, and stroll their grounds (even if their “grounds” are just 400 square feet in Greenpoint), please take a minute to recognize: wow, what a lovely experience this friend has offered you! You not only evaded the gazillion dollars spent on a hotel or Airbnb, but you probably drank all of their fourth-wave coffee and used all their two-ply toilet paper. You’re enjoying their hospitality, and you should show some appreciation. What makes a great host or hostess gift? Something that feels a little luxe, but not enough to embarrass the recipient; think a lovely little indulgence that you feel like you’d need an excuse to buy for yourself. Price doesn’t always dictate value — such an object can be acquired for less than 10 bucks. It’s the thought that counts, and you want to be clever. It’s no secret that candles make great gifts. They smell good; they establish an elevated ambiance, like you’re in a luxury hotel lobby; and they let you build a very tiny little fire in your home. Fun! But as with any heavily fragranced product, tastes diverge and preferences differ as to what smells “great.” One relatively safe bet: the scent of hinoki, a Japanese cypress tree with a sophisticated, woody, calming aroma. While many hinoki-scented candles are out there, I’m personally a fan of Boy Smells’ Hinoki Fantôme. It’s a very sexy gender-agnostic scent that’s both mysterious and inviting, with notes of cardamom, pear, and oakmoss, like a quiet walk through a forest. Prices taken at time of publishing. While there’s a case to be made that cheap olives make the best dirty martinis, they do not make the best gifts. A $30 jar of Williams Sonoma olives may read “I stay at the Four Seasons,” but in terms of flavor and snackability, I’m partial to Filthy’s olives, these ones stuffed with creamy blue cheese. (FWIW, my friend bartends at an excellent cocktail bar in Hollywood and he says the brand’s brine makes the perfect dirty martinis.) Prices taken at time of publishing. Speaking of small, round things that are intended to be the finishing touch on a cocktail but which you will want to eat straight out of the jar, one absolutely must mention Luxardo cherries. You’ve probably seen them on the shelves of high-end cocktail bars, but if you’re unfamiliar, these are not just any old maraschino cherries, like the bright red ones that came in your childhood Shirley Temples; they’re made with marasca cherries and possess a romantic, sophisticated, almost marzipan-like flavor and a superior texture, and come swimming in a syrup made only of cherry juice and sugar — no weird chemicals or artificial colors. Luxardo is an Italian-run family company that’s been in business since 1821, and it takes its cherry products very seriously, specializing exclusively in maraschino liqueur and these fabulous cherries. Plus, the label is gorgeous. Prices taken at time of publishing. My uncle, who is an architect with excellent taste in restaurants and can quote every single film ever shown on Turner Classic Movies, turned me onto these when I was in my 20s, when I watched him frantically search for them at multiple gourmet food stores in Manhattan as he verbally emphasized that they are the only cocktail cherries that matter. In fact, while we’re on the topic of bettering a home bartending experience, I’d like to revive appreciation for the embroidered cocktail napkin — a staple of Mad Men times that has been unfortunately subjugated in popularity by stupid millennial graphic coasters. May I never receive a chevron-patterned foam coaster again, and let’s imagine the joy one would experience to instead be handed, along with their spritz, a soft linen napkin embroidered with an elegant crane or pelican. Prices taken at time of publishing. If you’re into thrifting, the designs of cocktail napkins from the 50s and 60s suggest that maybe people really were partying harder back then. Cocktail picks are the perfect gift for toting to a party, since they easily fit in a pocket or purse and can immediately be enjoyed with a garnished drink or to pick up and bite into one of those blue-cheese-stuffed olives. I love all of Joanna Buchanan’s cocktail picks (this $200 zodiac set is to die for, truly, though certainly not cheap), but to get out of dream world and back into reality, this $25 stainless steel set from West Elm is surprisingly sexy. Prices taken at time of publishing. Practical and wholesome, a great mug will become a kitchen-cabinet staple. When I remodeled my kitchen a few years back, my contractor gave me a Williams Sonoma mug with my initials on it as a gift once the project was completed. I now use it all the time, and when I do, I think of him and his thoughtfulness while I drink my milky Scottish breakfast tea. Of course, the number of great mugs out there is infinite, making it hard to decide which one your host deserves. For no particular reason at all other than it’s very cute and it’s big — and I love a big, cute mug — I’m infatuated with this Nicholas Mosse sheep mug from store-full-of-adorable-things The Six Bells. It kind of reminds me of that sheep sweater that Princess Diana infamously wore, is hand-painted in Ireland, and its price is in that perfect sweet spot under $50. Prices taken at time of publishing. Similar sentiment, slightly edgier feel: a cool ashtray remains highly useful for non-smokers, too, serving as a home for keys, matchbooks, or those really good sesame cashews from Trader Joe’s. In fact, bring a bag of your favorite nut mix when you present this bad boy. Prices taken at time of publishing. We caught a tip recently that chefs are going wild for Naomi, a new brand of high-end hand wash that is specifically formulated to help eliminate cooking odors. (As garlic-lovers, this promise definitely appeals.) Our shopping team recently took the bergamot- and black-pepper-scented After-Cooking Hand Scrub for a spin and it’s absolutely phenomenal, getting the job done in spades and leaving behind an appealing fragrance on par with the historical king of status hand soaps, Aesop. Plus, love the Yves Klein blue packaging. Prices taken at time of publishing. One of the problems with gifting a bottle of wine is that as soon as it’s opened, it needs to be consumed within a few days, and therefore will quickly be forgotten. But if you hand someone a bottle of flashy olive oil, it will live on their counter or in their pantry for months, reminding them over and over again of your considerate gesture and your good taste. Flamingo Estate, home to many gifts that are so nice you could confidently give them to Gwyneth Paltrow herself, makes our current favorite fancy-schmancy olive oil, announcing on the bottle itself that it’s produced with olives from 150-year-old trees. This is the kind of stuff that rich housewives in the Silverlake hills try to manifest in yoga class. Prices taken at time of publishing. While I haven’t tried it myself, I’ve also symbolically (and aesthetically — look at that tin) taken to this beautiful Palestinian-made olive oil, Ya Albi, after recently editing a piece about the region’s new generation of olive oil makers. Prices taken at time of publishing. Yes, we are currently in a renaissance of incredible glassware; I doubt that I need to tell you that, or to remind you that everyone could use another set of nice glasses to bring out when they have company. Last Christmas, I got my sister this set of geometric stemless cocktail glasses by the glass wizard Sophie Lou Jacobsen. They’re unfortunately sold out now, but in the same spirit, these Anthropologie stemless martini glasses are very similar and reasonably priced, and I’m also blown away by these Serax glasses with a rounded, bubbly foot. Prices taken at time of publishing. As far as wine glasses go, the Eater staff is currently obsessed with short, chonky glasses — they feel more comfortable to wave around while you tell a fascinating story, compared to the nerve-wracking thin-stemmed ones. I’d much rather sip out of one of these Gianfranco Frattini glasses than one that feels like I could shatter it with a quick squeeze. Prices taken at time of publishing. No need to buy a whole set — it’s a little oppressive to give someone who’s not a family member or romantic partner something that takes up a lot of cabinet space. Two will do! Three is awkward and four is too many. If you choose it wisely, gifting a coffee table book makes you look so artistically astute that it will reinforce that you’re a fascinating person who deserves to be invited to future dinner parties. Anything from TASCHEN is a pretty safe bet (see: this book about menu design in America), but for a little more humor and cross-cultural appeal, A24’s 2024 cookbook-coffee-table-book Scrounging is a collection of recipes from cult-fave films — some more useful than others— that promises to spark intrigue and conversation, from Phantom Thread’s omelet to Napoleon Dynamite’s nachos. Prices taken at time of publishing. You could also get them a proper cookbook from which they will actually want to cook. Fair enough! In that instance, I’d recommend perusing our guide to the best cookbooks of spring 2025 and picking the most fitting option for your friend. If you are my friend, please get me Salt Sugar MSG. I was over at a fellow food writer’s house about six months ago and he made me try one of these. It was one of those things where he said, “You’ve got to taste these peppercorns. They are way different from any pepper you’ve ever had, I promise,” and frankly, I took one out of sheer politeness but didn’t believe his claims. That is, until I tasted one of these crunchy little guys for myself; I can confirm that honestly, they’re downright psychedelic in their depth of flavor and unique aroma. What makes The Reluctant Trading Experiment’s Tellicherry peppercorns so mind-blowing? Sourced from India and mainly sourced to high-end restaurants, they’re somehow intoxicating and dimensional, extra-hot and extra-peppery, yet citrusy and floral and shockingly complex. A grinder full of them would be a culinary gift from the heavens. Prices taken at time of publishing. I mean… just look at it. A real conversation piece. The tomato one is nice, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. Not all of us live within close proximity of a proper Jewish deli that can offer a revelatory doughy, cinnamony babka experience. Who wouldn’t (besides the gluten-free among us) be delighted to receive a sweet, decadent duo of babkas — one classic, one chocolaty — from famed New York deli Russ & Daughters? Prices taken at time of publishing. Pro tip: Order this gift set from Goldbelly ahead of time and schedule the delivery date to align with your arrival or the day of the party. That way you can not only arrive hands-free, but hopefully be offered a slice yourself. Two birds, one stone. In the great tradition of things we all want to have around but are sometimes too cheap to buy for ourselves, let us consider fancy salt. A box (or bucket) of Maldon is always appreciated, of course, but showing up with Jacobsen Salt’s aesthetic, transportable set of infused salts just feels a little more gift-y. Prices taken at time of publishing. Our editorial director Lesley Suter makes a strong case that serving spoons are the ultimate host gift, and it just makes you think: When you set down a beautifully assembled Caprese salad or tray of tater tot casserole, isn’t it nice to have some diva’d out utensils with which to serve it? Her picks in this persuasive piece are all top-tier, but right now I’m really into the short-handled (or even handle-free) claw-like ones, like this wood set from Williams Sonoma or the kind-of-nutso stoneware set below that’s probably quite heavy but sure looks swish. Still, they’re easier to maneuver than two long-handled spoons and a bit easier to store, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. If your event is, like, tomorrow, this surprisingly attractive set of salad tongs is available in three colors, can be overnighted via Amazon, and is expensive-looking given its attainable $30 price tag. Prices taken at time of publishing. It’s unrealistic to buy a host or hostess an entire cookware set, no matter how fabulous their party or home is. But you know what makes a surprisingly clever gift? A small skillet for when you’re in the mood for a cheeky fried egg or two, or you want to quickly put together a little Béarnaise sauce for your steak. We’re partial — naturally — to the one from our collab with Heritage Steel. It’s American-made with 5-ply stainless steel and is easy to clean and care for. Sometimes littler is better! Prices taken at time of publishing. You know when you take a stick of butter out of the fridge, hoping to spread it all over your beautiful slice of Out of Thin Air sesame gochujang sourdough, and instead it’s hard and it’s going to tear up the surface of your bread and you’re SAD? No longer a problem once you get your hands on one of these cleverly designed butter spreader knives, which you can glide over the top of your butter hunk to achieve a spreadable consistency instantly. Prices taken at time of publishing. Sure, it’s a bit of a stocking-stuffer type gadget, but it’s currently June, and we still think everyone should have one. Design-forward butter dishes are also having a major moment right now — more on that here. Cutting boards are, again, one of those things you could always use more of, especially from a chef-fave brand like Boos. We’ve gone on and on about how Boos blocks are the Bentleys of cutting boards, thanks to their high-quality wood and durable construction. Prices taken at time of publishing. Don’t ask me how I stumbled across this discovery, because it’s a very long and convoluted story, but it has come to my attention that the French designer Christian Lacroix — in addition to producing beautiful and theatrical clothing — has also made some really exquisite tableware and, more specifically, plates. Prices vary wildly on secondhand sites such as eBay, but if you look strategically, you can get a trompe l’oeil plate with his signature embellished cross on it for under $50 — with the original box, might I add. The butterfly collection is nice, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. Matches come in handy for many reasons; lighting candles, of course; sparking up a slim, cheeky joint; or keeping in your bathroom for houseguests in search of discretion about their activities. Yes, you could grab a matchbox for free at your favorite dive bar, but having a box of illustrated Diptyque matches sitting next to your soap dish is just a quiet flex. I was devastated to find out that all of Diptyque’s scented matches are currently sold out, but thankfully, Hibi’s beloved Japanese incense matches are currently in stock a few different places online. An eight-pack (below) will probably do the trick for a casual dinner party gift, but a 30-pack will keep your host’s home in a state of zen for weeks or months. Prices taken at time of publishing. I also genuinely love the gold-foiled, retro-hippie-chic look of classic Incense Matches, and I find the paper incense from Optatum to be so stylish and decorous, it looks like it belongs next to the sink of a bathroom in Versailles. Prices taken at time of publishing. Diptyque, while foolish not to immediately restock its scented matches, also makes a basil-scented odor-removing candle. Yes, it is $75, but according to the brand, it’s “based on a technology that targets and eliminates the molecules responsible for unpleasant odors. It replaces them with green and aromatic combinations of basil, mint, and tomato leaf.” There’s a somewhat convincing case here that it could quickly become a high-end kitchen essential. Prices taken at time of publishing. Eater has accurately referred to Levain as New York City’s most popular bakery, although it now has locations in multiple cities, all of which are very busy. I’m going to be totally honest with you: I do not love the cookies from Levain. I’m a flat, chewy, doughy cookie girl and I don’t like nuts in my cookies, and Levain’s cookies are tall, thick, gooey, and very nut-positive. But I can tell you this with confidence: People go absolutely feral for these cookies. The bakery’s closest location to me, in LA’s Larchmont neighborhood, is inundated with cookie-seekers at all hours of the day, with lines snaking down the block. I seem to be the only person in the world that simply doesn’t vibe that hard with Levain’s cookie style, so I can still advise that they will make a well-loved, quickly devoured gift. And honestly, this photo is borderline pornographic and makes me “get it.” Prices taken at time of publishing. Perhaps thanks to the modern ubiquity of the Aperol spritz, aperitifs and digestifs have never been more on-the-radar for the home-bar-cart crowd. As a Bay Area native, I came of indie-sleaze age drinking a lot of Fernet-Branca, the face-contorting bitter of choice for San Francisco bartenders. But, thanks to their sweetness, amaros are a little more user-friendly and giftable, and many of them feature beautiful bottles and offer an air like you went and fetched them directly from Italy. While there are dozens, if not hundreds, of superb amaros out there — I love the smoky honey flavor of Amaro Dell’Erborista and the fanciful bottle design of Amaro Nonino — I’d argue that the best bang for your buck is Amaro Meletti. Butterscotchy and cola-like (but not cloying) with notes of chocolate, anise, and saffron, it’s well-balanced, cheerful, and equally enjoyable neat, on the rocks, or with seltzer. It doesn’t hurt that at $26, its price is incredibly reasonable. Prices taken at time of publishing. Step it up by bringing a bottle of really good tequila. Eater’s guide to the best tequila is comprehensive and might just leave you even less decisive, since they all sound amazing, so I’ll narrow it down to two options for you. If you’re looking to spend less than $100, go with Siembra Valles reposado. “But I don’t like reposado,” you might say, traumatized by long, barely recallable nights with Mr. Cuervo in college. Fear not — this is a totally different experience. Made by maestro tequilero Don Salvador Rosales Briseño, this tequila has an almost vanilla-like flavor, and is aged in proprietary Missouri white oak barrels. It’s also paler than many reposado tequilas you’ll see on shelves, because it’s only aged for three months, giving it a more blanco-like taste with hints of mint and citrus fruit. Prices taken at time of publishing. If you are blessed with ample expendable income and/or are hoping to impress the unimpressible, show up with a bottle of Rey Sol Extra Añejo. It’s lauded as one of the finest tequilas available — for real! — falling into a special category reserved for those spirits aged a minimum of five years in carefully constructed oak barrels. Its aroma is known for offering rich notes of vanilla, caramel, and wood, and is on par with the most storied, world-famous whiskies in terms of quality and smoothness. Plus, that bottle — you’ll definitely want to keep it long after you’ve taken the last sip. Prices taken at time of publishing. You can trust me, wholeheartedly, on all of the ideas above, and I’ll trust that you won’t break another one of my Champagne glasses.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Dollar General Stock Soars as Discount Retailer Posts Solid Results

Major U.S. equities indexes finished higher after data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed an unexpected uptick in job openings in April, although several economists cautioned that tariffs could weigh on jobs growth as the year advances. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session 0.6% higher. The Dow added 0.5%. Strength among semiconductor firms and the rest of the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq 0.8%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets roundup here. Dollar General (DG) shares surged 16%, chalking up the S&P 500's top daily performance after the discount retailer topped quarterly sales and profit estimates and boosted its full-year outlook. The company anticipated that it should be able to mitigate most tariff-related cost pressure but expressed uncertainty around the possible impact on consumer spending trends. Analysts have said that dollar stores could be poised to benefit as consumers trade down in the current environment. Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR), set to report its own results Wednesday morning, were up 6%. Shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) jumped 11% after the company's top executive discussed expectations for a recovery in demand. In a presentation at the Bank of America Technology Conference, Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury pointed to signs of recovery in the company's industrials market, its second largest, as well as indications that the automotive market could see a bottom in the second quarter. First Solar (FSLR) stock bounced 6.5% higher on Tuesday, reversing losses posted in the prior session. Shares of companies in the renewable energy space have come under pressure since the House passed a reconciliation bill that calls for the elimination of numerous clean energy initiatives and the Department of Energy cancelled an array of related grants. Mizuho analysts boosted their price target on the stock. Crude oil futures prices extended their recent string of gains, bolstered by increasing geopolitical tensions, including an escalation of the war in Ukraine and an uncertain outlook for a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. The price uptick helped lift oil and gas stocks, with shares of exploration and production firm APA Corp. (APA) gaining 5.4%. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE), the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, dropped 6.2%, the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. Kenvue CEO Thibaut Mongon suggested that a lagging transition from spring into winter had contributed to soft seasonal demand for allergy and sun protection products. FactSet Research Systems (FDS) shares sank 4.8% after the financial data and software provider announced that Sanoke Viswanathan, formerly an executive at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), would take the reins as CEO starting in September. Current CEO Phil Snow is set to retire and exit his position on FactSet's board of directors at that time.

Title: Stonetrust Insurance Credit Ratings Unchanged Amid Acquisition of Southern Vanguard

AM Best said that the Credit Ratings (ratings) of Southern Vanguard Insurance Company (Southern Vanguard) (Austin, Texas) and the members of Stonetrust Insurance Group (Stonetrust) (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) remain unchanged following the May 27, 2025, announcement that Wintaai America Inc. (Wintaai), Stonetrust’s holding company, will be acquiring Southern Vanguard, subject to regulatory approval. The members of Stonetrust have a Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A- (Excellent) and Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a-” (Excellent) with positive outlooks. Southern Vanguard has an FSR of A- (Excellent) and a Long-Term ICR of “a-” (Excellent) with stable outlooks. Wintaai owns 99.94% of Stonetrust and the remaining is owned by various employees. Wintaai will own 100% of Southern Vanguard following conclusion of the transaction, which is pending regulatory approval and expected to close by July 2025. Aside from the transaction cost, Wintaai will also add capital to Southern Vanguard as a post-close contribution. AM Best said it does not expect the transaction to have any material change to either the rating unit’s rating fundamentals or business operations. The credit ratings agency will continue to evaluate each of these organizations independently while monitoring the progress and the effects of this transaction over time. Mike Dileo will remain president and chief executive officer of Stonetrust and Cory Moulton will remain president and chief executive officer of Southern Vanguard.

Title: Builder.ai collapses after revelation that its 'AI' was hundreds of engineers

Cutting corners: Builder.ai promised to revolutionize software development with artificial intelligence – and convinced deep-pocketed investors it had. Backed by Microsoft and valued at $1.5 billion, the startup masked manual labor as machine learning until the facade crumbled, leaving behind lawsuits, layoffs, and one of the industry's most embarrassing collapses. Builder.ai has collapsed under the weight of several deceptions, ending the rise of a British startup once heralded as a pioneer in democratizing software development. Valued at $1.5 billion in 2023 with backing from Microsoft and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the company filed for bankruptcy protection this week after revelations that its "AI-powered" platform relied on hundreds of engineers in India while executives allegedly orchestrated a years-long financial deception. For eight years, Builder.ai marketed its "Natasha" AI system as a fully autonomous tool that could build software "as easily as ordering pizza." However, internal documents and employee accounts reviewed by Bloomberg paint a sharply different picture. Engineers in Noida and Bangalore manually coded client projects while being instructed to mimic AI-generated responses. "We were told to never mention our location or use Indian English phrases," said a former Bangalore engineer. The team timed updates to UK business hours to maintain the illusion of automation. The company's downfall accelerated in April 2025 when Bloomberg exposed a round-tripping scheme with Indian social media firm VerSe Innovation. From 2021 to 2024, the two companies exchanged nearly identical invoices totaling millions of dollars for services never rendered, artificially inflating Builder.ai's revenue by up to 300 percent. Audits later revealed 2024 revenues totaled just $55 million – a fraction of the $220 million projected to investors. VerSe co-founder Umang Bedi denied the allegations, calling them "absolutely baseless." Microsoft's $455 million investment in 2023, including plans to integrate Builder.ai's technology with Azure, now stands as a cautionary tale. The partnership fell apart when creditor Viola Credit seized $37 million from Builder.ai's accounts after uncovering inflated financials, leaving only $5 million in restricted funds. The startup also owes $85 million to Amazon and $30 million to Microsoft for cloud services. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has subpoenaed financial records and customer lists as part of a widening probe into potential securities fraud. Separately, the SEC is investigating whether Builder.ai misrepresented its technological capabilities to investors. Internal Slack messages show executives directing staff to "minimize visibility" of human labor in investor materials. "Positioning must focus on our proprietary AI – human labor isn't part of the story," a 2022 internal memo stated. Founder Sachin Dev Duggal, who styled himself Chief Wizard, resigned as CEO in February 2025 amid mounting losses and relocated to Dubai. His replacement, Manpreet Ratia, disclosed that the company laid off approximately 80 percent of its global workforce – about 1,000 employees. The insolvency marks the most significant AI startup failure to occur since ChatGPT's breakthrough debut in 2022, underscoring growing scrutiny of "AI washing" across the tech sector.

Title: 6 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For June 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-stocks-buy-now-june-2025/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T19:05:24Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. The best growth stocks are well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Many growth stocks lost value in the heat of the whiplash tariff announcements in early April. As a group, they’re crawling their way back towards positive for the year, at least according to the Russell 1000 Growth index. The current window for capturing good prices on growth stocks may be closing. If you prefer not to wait for the next round of selloffs and you're ready for some investing inspiration, take a look at the six promising growth stocks below. These six best growth stocks have strong recent and projected sales and earnings per share (EPS) growth, plus conservative debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios. They are also more than 50% owned by institutional investors, such as hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, insurance companies and other large money managers. These are folks with access to sophisticated research teams and tools. When this crowd loves a stock, it signals confidence in that company’s growth prospects. Here are the exact screening metrics used to identify these growth stocks: The table below introduces the six best stocks to buy now, according to the above parameters. A more detailed review of each stock follows. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025 and long-term growth stocks. Nvidia designs and sells semiconductors and related hardware. The company also maintains a suite of software development tools. Customers include automotive OEMs, device manufacturers, cloud providers, internet companies and distributors. Nvidia has a dominant market share in AI-capable chips used in data centers. The company's products also have automotive, gaming, robotics and telecommunications applications. It’s commonplace to see Nvidia in a list of top growth stocks. The magnitude of the company's growth trajectory almost demands it. Since early 2023, Nvidia has increased annual sales from $26 billion to $130 billion, while its market cap has ballooned from $500 billion to $3.3 trillion. That happened after the company had raised annual sales by about 25% on average in the previous five years. AI adoption fueled this recent growth phase, but Nvidia has a long history of vision, innovation and execution—the trifecta of success factors in technology. While the biggest gains are already on the books, Nvidia isn’t likely to stop growing. The company has $53.7 billion of cash on its balance sheet, plus a savvy founder/CEO to keep competition at bay. For the first quarter 2026, Nvidia reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 69% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27%. The results included a $4.5 billion charge resulting from changes in the U.S. government’s policy on chip sales to China. Analysts expect Nvidia to deliver 56% revenue growth and 50.7% EPS growth in fiscal 2026. Tradeweb builds and maintains investment trading marketplaces for stocks, bonds, credit, derivatives and other asset classes. The technology focus is on faster trades and data transparency. Clients are institutional investors and wealth managers. Tradeweb values its total addressable market at $8.9 trillion. With annual sales of $1.8 billion, the company owns only a sliver of the market. The largest opportunities are in ETFs and credit, where Tradeweb has 6% and 17% market share, respectively. The growth plan involves acquisitions and customer-driven technology innovation, particularly in rules-based trading. Tradeweb has expertise in automation. It launched its flagship Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool for U.S. Treasuries in 2012. As rules-based trading has become more popular, so has AiEX. The company is also incorporating AI to provide customers with advanced analytics before and after trades. For the first quarter 2025, Tradeweb reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 24.7% and diluted EPS growth of 16.9%. For the full year 2025, analysts expect sales and EPS increases of 23.3% and 51.6%, respectively. Monday.com builds and maintains software that business teams use to manage projects, collaborate, track sales leads and organize software development workflows. Customers include businesses, educational institutions and governments. Monday.com solutions fit in between overbuilt, expensive enterprise applications and off-the-shelf software that can’t fully address a team's unique workflows. The company's Work Operating System is a modular, customizable system clients can use to build the tools they need, without the expense and extended implementation timeline—two hallmarks of enterprise software. The functional, but robust product offering has propelled the company’s sales from $161 million in 2020 to $972 million last year. In that time, Monday.com has made strong progress moving up-market to a higher-dollar customer base, which is a key element of the growth strategy. While earnings just turned positive in 2024, Monday.com’s free cash flow in both 2023 and 2024 exceeded $200 million. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, an ample source of growth funding. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, Monday.com reported 30% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, 38% more customers worth $50,000-plus in annual sales and a non-GAAP operating margin of 14%. Analysts expect Monday.com to produce 28% sales growth and 523% EPS growth in 2025. Nova provides equipment, technology and solutions to help semiconductor manufacturers produce chips faster and more efficiently. The company specializes in dimensional metrology solutions, which provide precision size and shape measurements. Nova solutions address multiple stages of the semiconductor manufacturing lifecycle. Customers include leading integrated circuit manufacturers in Asia, Europe and North America. Semiconductor manufacturing is a thriving industry. According to a recent Deloitte report, 2024 semiconductor sales grew 19% to $627 billion. Expected 2025 sales are $697 billion, placing the industry on an easy pace to reach $1 trillion in sales by 2030 and $2 trillion by 2040. Nova’s role in helping manufacturers improve efficiency and output is critical to that growth. The company has an interesting mix of advantages: innovative technologies, a high-margin business model and ample growth opportunity. With that foundation, the leadership team is targeting $1 billion in sales by 2027. The 2027 outlook also includes a gross margin of 57% to 60%, R&D spend of 15% to 17% of sales and EPS close to $10—a 75% increase from the 2024 EPS of $5.75. For the first quarter, Nova reported 50% sales growth and 77% GAAP diluted EPS growth vs. the prior-year period. Analysts expect Nova to deliver sales growth of 30% and EPS growth of 49% in 2025. Krystal Biotech develops and sells genetic therapies treating rare diseases. In 2023, the company received FDA approval for Vyjuvek, the first treatment for the skin disorder dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Vyjuvek is now available in the U.S. and expanding globally. Krystal Biotech additionally has five active clinical programs addressing cystic fibrosis, solid tumors and another skin disorder, lamellar ichthyosis. Krystal Biotech focuses on identifying therapies for conditions with high unmet needs. As an example, before the U.S. launch of Vyjuvek, there was no treatment for DEB despite the severity of the disease. DEB is associated with recurring and chronic wounds that are costly to treat, as well as increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. The company is also developing a treatment for Apha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a disorder that precedes progressive lung disease. More than 250,000 patients worldwide have AATD. There is no cure and treatment options are limited. KRYS additionally has scalable, in-house manufacturing capacity to support Vyjuvek’s global expansion and other growth opportunities. Krystal Biotech began generating revenue in 2023. 2024 sales eclipsed $290 million, and EPS totaled $3 per share. Analysts expect 48.7% revenue growth and 104.3% EPS growth this year. Liquidity Services sells its clients' surplus assets on the world's largest B2B ecommerce network, via self-serve and fully managed auction offerings. Operating in more than 100 countries, the company has 5.7 million registered buyers and facilitates 1 million transactions annually. Liquidity Services adds value on three levels. Clients have an easy solution for liquidating unneeded assets, buyers have access to assets at liquidation pricing and landfills have less waste to process. The company also has an enviable client list spanning multiple industries and regions. Chevron, Shell, Sony, Volvo, P&G, Walmart and Amazon are among the names that LQDT services. The company values its addressable market at over $130 billion, which it breaks down into five sectors: Liquidity Services has regularly increased its gross merchandise volume and revenue since fiscal 2021. In its most recent quarter, LQDT reported sales growth of 27% and GAAP diluted EPS growth of 22%. Analysts expect a 35% revenue increase and a 99% increase in EPS in fiscal 2025. Bottom Line Growth stocks can move fast, up and down. Opt for well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Those qualities help growth players thrive in good times and survive in bad ones.

Title: Bitcoin: How BlackRock can create BTC’s next supply shock

BlackRock signals $100T advisor interest in Bitcoin market as metrics point to an incoming institutional demand. Bitcoin [BTC] might be preparing for its next big wave of institutional flows. Financial planners with more than $100 trillion in assets under management might get easier access to BTC exposure in the near term, per BlackRock reports. This has infused new bullish sentiment in the market. Institutional demand for Bitcoin is not novel, but they are accelerating rapidly. As regulatory landscapes shift and spot ETFs become more mainstream, advisors now have a more transparent path to including BTC in diversified portfolios. BlackRock’s announcement follows this trend and implies that the next round of demand will come from wealth managers who had been sidelined in the past. The market is responding in real-time. Since big-ticket institutional investment picked pace, Bitcoin Open Interest has recorded a steady and uninterrupted rise. The trend suggests growing confidence among traders that there is a supply-demand gap brewing. Derivative Open Interest is also likely to mirror the volume of money going into options and futures. Its current consistent rise suggests that big institutions are betting on volatility—typically looking forward to a significant price movement. At present, the direction remains bullish. Source: CryptoQuant Alongside the rising Open Interest, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate has also increased. An increasing Funding Rate indicates that more traders are going long—expecting prices to go up. Such a shift usually precedes bullish breakouts, especially if it comes with institutional news. However, increasing Funding Rates can also introduce short-term volatility. Over-enthusiastic longs can lead to steep corrections, but if institutional flows do materialize, dips can be countered by intense buying. Source: CoinGlass Everyone turns to Bitcoin’s supply side these days. With only 21 million coins and dwindling flow from miners following the halving, increased institutional demand may form the foundation of a supply shock. Unlike retail traders, institutions carry long term goals and like to lock up supply. Once advisors who oversee trillions of dollars begin deploying even small percentages of their portfolios into action, supply from exchanges may disappear in a flash, taking BTC further.

Title: SpaceX Seizes on 'Careless Errors' to Delay AST SpaceMobile's Giant Satellite
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/networking/30211/spacex-seizes-on-careless-errors-to-delay-ast-spacemobiles-giant-satellite
Time Published: 2025-06-03T16:22:13Z
Full Content:
Could SpaceX derail a rival's next-generation satellite project because of paperwork issues? On Monday, the company urged the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss an application from AST SpaceMobile because of "careless errors" and "inconsistencies" in the documentation. "While AST extolls the titanic capabilities of its satellite in its application, it simultaneously seeks to hide the risks of its operations,” SpaceX says in a filing. Texas-based AST has been trying to secure FCC experimental authorization to operate a prototype satellite called FM1, which is scheduled to launch in July. The huge satellite, which is designed to offer internet to mobile phones, spans 223 square meters, or about three times larger than the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. AST first filed its regulatory request for FM1 in March. But since then, it has faced an ongoing back-and-forth with the FCC over errors and incomplete data. "Wilde is in Argentina, not Australia. Please correct this repeated error in the API,” the FCC told the company last Friday, while raising five other issues. In total, the FCC has sent AST five emails about submitting additional details and correcting the application. On Monday, SpaceX seized on the paperwork problems, alleging that AST’s orbit safety plans for the satellites have been "hastily revised." "Unfortunately, AST's experimental license application and supplemental submissions fail to demonstrate substantial completeness or compliance with the Commission’s rules, or that authorizing these high-risk test operations would serve the public interest,” SpaceX says. The company’s four-page letter lists the alleged flaws with AST's paperwork, concluding that its "orbital debris mitigation plan fails to demonstrate that the FM1 satellite can operate safely and sustainably."

Could SpaceX derail a rival's next-generation satellite project because of paperwork issues? On Monday, the company urged the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss an application from AST SpaceMobile because of "careless errors" and "inconsistencies" in the documentation. "While AST extolls the titanic capabilities of its satellite in its application, it simultaneously seeks to hide the risks of its operations,” SpaceX says in a filing. Texas-based AST has been trying to secure FCC experimental authorization to operate a prototype satellite called FM1, which is scheduled to launch in July. The huge satellite, which is designed to offer internet to mobile phones, spans 223 square meters, or about three times larger than the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. AST first filed its regulatory request for FM1 in March. But since then, it has faced an ongoing back-and-forth with the FCC over errors and incomplete data. "Wilde is in Argentina, not Australia. Please correct this repeated error in the API,” the FCC told the company last Friday, while raising five other issues. In total, the FCC has sent AST five emails about submitting additional details and correcting the application. On Monday, SpaceX seized on the paperwork problems, alleging that AST’s orbit safety plans for the satellites have been "hastily revised." "Unfortunately, AST's experimental license application and supplemental submissions fail to demonstrate substantial completeness or compliance with the Commission’s rules, or that authorizing these high-risk test operations would serve the public interest,” SpaceX says. The company’s four-page letter lists the alleged flaws with AST's paperwork, concluding that its "orbital debris mitigation plan fails to demonstrate that the FM1 satellite can operate safely and sustainably." The same document also faults the application for failing to provide more details on how the company will prevent its satellite from disrupting astronomy, even though AST recently reached a deal with the US National Science Foundation. The complaints might delay AST's launch of the FM1 satellite in July through India’s space agency. In April, SpaceX also sent another letter to the FCC, claiming that AST’s proposal for the FM1 potentially threatens orbital safety.

Title: Who do Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper compare to? NBA player comps for 2025's top 6 draft prospects

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Comparison is the death of joy … but you have to wonder if Mark Twain would stick to that tune if the NBA Draft were around back then. For draft fans, player comps can in fact be the root of joy. While no comp is ever perfect, it provides a context for fans to quickly familiarize themselves with prospects in a fun way. Don't kid yourself -- real NBA decision-makers also participate in such activities. Again, it's about context but also precedence. If you're projecting a prospect to the next level and trying to figure out what role they'll be able to play, it's only natural to ask yourself if similar players have had success in that role. So, with the 2025 NBA Draft now little more than three weeks away and with six prospects most commonly being mocked in the top half of the lottery, here are the player comps to help prepare you for draft night and shed some light on what front offices may be contemplating. Kirilenko was my comp for Flagg coming into the season. A game-changing defender off-ball, with versatility on the ball at 6-foot-9, he approached nearly 5 stocks (steals + blocks) per game in his prime and had a rare ability to stuff all columns of the stat sheet. Offensively, he could impact winning without needing to the be the focal point, but was capable of being a very good secondary threat, if not a consistent shooter. While the validity of this comp still holds on the defensive end, Flagg has outgrown AK-47's offensive correlation. Coming into the year at Duke, we had two questions about Flagg: the consistency of the shooting (both from an accuracy and mechanical standpoint) and the self-creation. He addressed those by continuing to elevate his game and making glaring progress throughout the season, to the point where he shot over 40% from behind the arc in ACC play. He still tends to have two different releases -- a set shot when spotting up and a true jump shot when shooting on the move or off the dribble -- so there are some lingering questions, but not nearly to the same extent. There's also much more optimism that he can be a primary scoring option in the NBA, and yet his game -- specifically his passing and natural unselfishness -- is ideal to complement another alpha scorer. This is where the Pippen comp comes in. He looks like he can headline an offense, but whether that's the offense of an NBA championship caliber team is still to be determined. Harper is a big lead guard, measuring in at just under 6-foot-6 with shoes on and a massive wingspan that eclipses 6-foot-10. He has terrific natural instincts and feel for the game that manifest itself with floor vision, timing, and creative footwork. All of that helps him compensate for the fact that he is neither a totally knockdown three-point shooter, nor a dynamic vertical athlete. He came into college viewed as a combo-guard, capable of playing on or off the ball. While that versatility will translate to the next level as well, he was the full-time point guard at Rutgers and now is most natural as a primary initiator, which makes a potential fit for guard-stocked San Antonio at No. 2 overall questionable. Our description of Harper is reminiscent of Cunningham, who was just a bit bigger, but from a very similar archetype when he came into the league. He's made strides with his shooting, as Harper should be capable of doing, while simultaneously maintaining his ability to make plays for himself and others with his instincts and mental acuity for the game. Many believe that Harper has a similarly bright future, but durability will be a key variable, as it has been for Cunningham. This past season was the first time in his four-year career that he's played 70 games and he responded with his first All-NBA season. In late December of his senior year, Bailey's McEachern High School team traveled to New Jersey to play in an event at Rutgers' Jersey Mikes Arena. The future Scarlet Knight delivered a 40-point 21-rebound performance that was one for the ages, and was streamed directly by the NBA. It was on that night that Tracy McGrady comparisons were born. While those may be mocked now, to see it in person was to see the validity. The 6-foot-9 wing soared for numerous incredible dunks and simultaneously put on a tough shot-making show. This year at Rutgers there were more undeniable highs (39 points at Indiana, 37 at Northwestern), but not the overall consistency to perpetuate comps to one of the NBA's all-time great wing scorers. So his comp drops several rungs. Nonetheless, Bailey still has a combination of wing size, athleticism, and shot-making that gives him undeniable upside. His assist-to-turnover numbers are concerning and his inability to put more pressure on the rim in the halfcourt is somewhat surprising given his athletic tools. Porter had that same overlap of size, shooting and athleticism, along with similar measurables, and even some of the same concerns such as assist-to-turnover ratio and lack of blow-by in the halfcourt. Bailey's range of outcomes is perhaps wider than any other player in the top 6, but Porter's path provides a clear template that could lead to long-term success and impacting winning. Victor Oladipo was once known as an undersized wing who compensated for a lack of skill and positional size with extreme length, athleticism, and the high-motor. Edgecombe too was much more of a wing than true guard in high school and known for his extreme athleticism and two-way competitiveness. We saw him make notable strides with his guard skills during the course of his season at Baylor, but that process is one that will need to be on-going. He measured in at 6-foot-4 without shoes with a 6-foot-7 wingspan. By comparison, he's a little bigger than Oladipo, but not quite as long. The athletic similarities aren't just based on their high-flying athleticism, but the sheer force and explosiveness they can utilize in to cover the court and explode downhill. Edgecombe, like Oladipo, not only has to keep polishing and expanding his ball-skills and ability to make reads, but he has a chance to weaponize his physical gifts on the defensive end of the floor. He's not yet quite as far along as advertised on that end, particularly off the ball, but the potential is there, both from a physical and mental perspective. Johnson is a potent scorer and tough shot-maker. He's been that since high school. There was little doubt he was going to be given an opportunity to put up numbers this year at Texas, but the big question centered around his efficiency and ability to impact winning in the process. There was a very similar narrative for Thomas when he arrived at LSU in 2019. He went on to put up 23 points on 17 shots per game for a team that went 19-10. Since then, his scoring prowess has continued to ascend in the NBA, but questions persist about whether his spurt bucket-getting can drive winning. Conversely, Johnson put up 20 points this year on 16 shots per game, but exceeded expectations when it came to his overall efficiency. His 43/40/87 shooting splits were more than respectable, especially for a freshman that was the top priority for opposing defenses on a nightly basis. He also made clear gains with his passing this year. It was the combination of that unexpected efficiency, albeit amidst steady volume, along with the gains in his processing that has helped him surge up draft boards. There is optimism Johnson can be an instant-offense type scorer like Thomas, but if the growth we saw this season continues, there may be a path for him to be even more than that. Knueppel may not be the 6-foot-8 that Duke listed him at this year. In reality, he's 6-foot-5 without shoes on with a wingspan just over 6-foot-6. In short (no pun intended), he's not very long or athletic, but is still one heck of a basketball player. Knueppel is skilled and smart. He's a shooter and floor-spacer who thrived as a floor-spacer secondary playmaker for Duke this year and even may have had more primary playmaking potential than he got to show running alongside Flagg all year. All of that is on par with what we've seen from Austin Reaves in recent years, as he took on a bigger role than expected right away for the Lakers and has seen his output grow with each passing year because of his ability to both play off more dynamic individual talents, but then have spurts where he can carry a second-unit. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Title: Nvidia Added to Jefferies 'Franchise Picks'

Jefferies has added Nvidia (NVDA) to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” a group its analysts describe as “our highest-conviction, Buy-rated stocks.” In Nvidia’s case, the reason for conviction is the chipmaker’s position as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train artificial intelligence models. Jefferies came away from Nvidia’s quarterly results impressed with the chipmaker’s revenue projections—which largely mirrored what analysts expected despite a larger-than-expected impact from U.S. export curbs. Nvidia said it expects to take an $8 billion hit this quarter due to lost revenue from sales of H20 chips, which the Trump administration barred from being sold in China. The analysts pointed to the “massive step up” in AI commitments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a reason for revenue optimism. Last month, Nvidia agreed to supply chips to Saudi AI startup Humain, while the U.S. and UAE reached a deal allowing the Middle Eastern nation to import American-made AI chips. Nvidia, grappling with Microsoft (MSFT) for the title of the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at more than $3.4 trillion, traded 2% higher shortly after the opening bell Tuesday. The stock has gained roughly 5% so far in 2025.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs navigate $1.2 billion outflows amid European retail approval

American investors exit Bitcoin ETFs while European retail taps into new opportunities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have entered a third consecutive day of outflows, shedding more than $1 billion. This trend reflects a shift in institutional sentiment as Bitcoin’s price continues to hover around the $105,000 mark without a clear breakout. Data from SoSoValue shows that the 12 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced $268 million in net outflows on June 2 alone. This follows larger exits on May 29 and 30, when the funds collectively lost more than $1 billion. Industry analysts suggest that these outflows are tied to the broader market cooling. Bitcoin’s price has traded in a tight band over the past week, prompting large investors to reduce risk or shift capital to other asset classes. This behavior is common during periods of price consolidation, where expectations of near-term gains are muted. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF in the US, has not been immune to the trend. However, that has not significantly impacted its position among the country’s top 25 largest ETFs. IBIT currently manages over $72 billion in assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted IBIT’s rapid rise in a recent analysis. He noted that at just 1.4 years old, IBIT is the youngest ETF in the top 25, which is significantly younger than any of its peers. Despite Bitcoin’s recent price performance, institutional investors in other jurisdictions remain interested in the flagship digital asset. On June 3, Jacobi Asset Management expanded access to its Bitcoin ETF by removing long-standing investment restrictions. The change allows retail investors in Europe to directly invest in the product, following a decision by Guernsey’s regulator to scrap the professional-only classification and minimum capital requirements. Jacobi CEO Peter Lane welcomed the change, saying: “Our fund was designed from day one with a regulated, institutional-grade structure that investors could trust and were familiar with. Now, with greater regulatory alignment and growing public interest, we’re delighted to expand access to all investors across eligible jurisdictions.” He also praised Guernsey’s proactive approach and expressed optimism about the potential to roll out more regulated crypto investment vehicles soon.

Title: What’s Going On With The Part Of The Disney Co. Folks Forget About, Disney Publishing
URL: https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/97865-what-comes-next-for-a-changed-disney-publishing.html
Time Published: 2025-06-03T14:01:00Z
Full Content:
The Walt Disney Company’s book operations have undergone a series of changes over the years as the company has morphed into a media and entertainment colossus. Disney Publishing’s most recent big pivot came in 2020, when it sold 1,110 children’s titles to Hachette Book Group and made the decision to focus on acquiring global content that it can leverage across multiple platforms and media. In recent months, the group has made a number of significant changes, but company executives said their mission remains the same. “We remain focused on acquiring and developing global content that could be leveraged across multiple platforms and media,” Tonya Agurto, SVP and publisher of new IP and global business development, Disney Publishing, wrote in an email to PW. While its objectives remains unchanged, Disney has made a number of tweaks to its publishing division in order to fulfill that mission. Over the last six months, two high-ranking children’s publishing executives have left the company, which also made a number of layoffs in marketing and other departments earlier this year. In April, it announced several promotions at Hyperion Avenue, the adult imprint Disney founded in 2021, eight years after it sold the majority of its adult titles to HBG. Earlier this month, Disney announced it had reached a new, broad licensing agreement with Penguin Random House, a move that had been rumored for weeks. Under the agreement, PRH is licensing content from the 20th Century Studios, Disney, Marvel, National Geographic, Pixar, and Star Wars units. The agreement includes children’s books; middle grade, young adult, and adult novels; manga; and reference books across print, e-book, and audio formats. PRH has licensed Disney properties for over 20 years, and both parties called the deal an expansion of their relationship. The agreement also deepens Disney’s ties to PRH, which took over distribution for Disney’s adult and children’s print books from HBG in 2023. In her email, Agurto noted that Disney Publishing has a presence in more than 100 countries and products available in more than 40 languages, adding that “as our business evolves, we continue to explore new licensing agreements that bring books to fans of all ages.” After finalizing the agreement, Random House Children’s Books hired about a dozen editors and other employees who had worked at Disney Publishing on the National Geographic Kids imprint. Among the new PRH employees is Vivian Suchman, who was named editorial director of National Geographic Kids after serving as managing editor for that imprint while it was at Disney. The announcement of the PRH licensing agreement came a few weeks after Monique Diman-Riley was promoted from director of sales in North America for Disney Publishing Group to VP of sales and retail strategy for Disney Publishing. In that role, Disney said, Diman-Riley will “expand her scope to work with licensing partners to drive promotional branded opportunities at retail for the larger Disney publishing portfolio.” Among the executives who have recently departed Disney are Kieran Viola and Sylvie Frank. Viola joined Disney in 2021 to oversee Disney Hyperion, with a mandate to find new bestselling children’s authors, and is now an executive editor at Scholastic. Frank had served as editorial director of Disney Hyperion, overseeing acquisitions across all young reader formats, as well as the Freedom Fire and Disney Planet Possible imprints; she is now senior executive editor at Flamingo Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers. Following the moves, Jennifer Levesque now heads up all children’s and adult imprints at Disney. This spring, Levesque was promoted from director of editorial for Hyperion Avenue to deputy publisher for Disney Publishing Group, where she also oversees both Hyperion Kids and National Geographic Adult. A Whole New World In email responses to PW, Agurto repeatedly referred to Disney as the number one children’s publishing brand. Still, as far as original trade publishing goes, the company appears to be slipping. Disney doesn’t disclose financial information on publishing, but a look at PW bestseller lists indicates that the company has had a diminishing presence on the children’s side. In 2023, Disney had 14 titles reach PW’s children’s frontlist fiction list, keeping the company on the charts for 68 weeks; last year, that number fell to seven titles across 57 weeks last year. In 2019, Disney stayed on the same list for 81 weeks, with 19 books. Disney's most reliably bestselling author to date is Rick Riordan, through his Percy Jackson series and Rick Riordan Presents imprint. Riordan's two frontlist Jackson titles in 2024 sold approximately 450,000 print copies combined, according to Circana BookScan. But backlist sales across the company have softened in recent years—no doubt due in part to the 1,100 children’s titles it sold to HBG in 2020. The future of several Disney children’s imprints also appears uncertain. In October 2023, the company announced the launch of Kugali Ink, a collaboration with pan-African entertainment company Kugali designed to celebrate African voices. Its first two graphic novels, Akanni and Runeless, are due out this year, but neither title has yet been listed on Amazon, and PW has not received galleys for review. In a previous release announcing a number of promotions, Disney said that Rachel Stark had been promoted to senior editor at Hyperion, and that they would serve as lead editor for Kugali Ink. In Stark’s own note in the announcement, they stressed that they acquire and edit middle grade and young adult novels and graphic novels, quipping that this wasn’t a new role and observing that “agents often seem to believe I only acquire graphic novels.” A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on Kugali, adding that the company had no additional information to share about the status of its Melissa de la Cruz Studio and Freedom Fire imprints. On the adult side, however, things seem a bit more stable. With Levesque’s promotion, Adam Wilson, previously executive editor for Hyperion Avenue, was named editorial director, and now oversees the acquisition of adult fiction and nonfiction as well as the creation of original adult IP. Among his focuses, per Disney’s promotion announcement, are the oversight of nonfiction projects by individuals with a connection to other Disney projects and collaborations with a number of other Disney-owned groups—including ABC, ESPN, FX, Hulu, and Marvel—on both fiction and nonfiction book initiatives. In her email to PW, Agurto doubled down on Disney’s commitment to adult nonfiction publishing. “We continue to support nonfiction through both our vertical and licensees,” she wrote, pointing to the nonfiction published under Andscape, Hyperion, and National Geographic Adult. Forthcoming titles from those imprints include memoirs from actor and sports broadcaster Jayne Kennedy and the late film producer Jon Landau (Avatar; Titanic). Since its 2021 launch, Hyperion Avenue has also added the Marvel Crime line, which publishes books by bestselling crime and mystery authors featuring Marvel’s characters; the imprint’s first title, Breaking the Dark: A Jessica Jones Marvel Crime Novel, hit shelves last year. Overall, Hyperion Avenue saw two titles—A Confident Cook and Tangled Up in You—hit the PW adult bestseller lists in 2024, each staying for one week. For years, especially when synergy was the business-world strategy of the moment, top executives at Disney took different approaches on how to best fit book publishing into the corporation. But Disney is now a $91 billion conglomerate, with interests that range from cruise ships to streaming services to ESPN to theme parks. Given the scope of its businesses and the scale of recent changes, many industry insiders have been left wondering what, exactly, the current plan for books is inside the Magic Kingdom. Loading...

The nature and effect of mutations are of fundamental importance to the evolutionary process. The generation of mutations with mutagens has also played important roles in genetics. Applications of mutagens include dissecting the genetic basis of trait variation, inducing desirable traits in crops, and understanding the nature of genetic load. Previous studies of sodium azide-induced mutations have reported single nucleotide variants (SNVs) found in individual genes. To characterize the nature of mutations induced by sodium azide, we analyze whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 11 barley lines derived from sodium azide mutagenesis, where all lines were selected for diminution of plant fitness owing to induced mutations. We contrast observed mutagen-induced variants with those found in standing variation in WGS of 13 barley landraces. Here, we report indels that are two orders of magnitude more abundant than expected based on nominal mutation rates. We found induced SNVs are very specific, with C → T changes occurring in a context followed by another C on the same strand (or the reverse complement). The codons most affected by the mutagen include the sodium azide-specific CC motif (or the reverse complement), resulting in a handful of amino acid changes and few stop codons. The specific nature of induced mutations suggests that mutagens could be chosen based on experimental goals. Sodium azide would not be ideal for gene knockouts but will create many missense mutations with more subtle effects on protein function. Sodium azide is frequently used as a mutagen for experimental studies in plants. It induces primarily C → T changes. We find that these most often occur when a cytosine (C) is followed by another cytosine. In coding sequence, this results in a limited yet distinct set of amino acid alterations that differ from natural variants in barley. Notably, harmful mutations prevalent in sodium azide-treated samples include glycine to aspartic acid and proline to serine, while untreated landraces exhibit distinct sets of putatively harmful changes. The mutated lines demonstrate an average yield reduction of 37.7% due to induced single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels), which disrupt numerous coding variants. Although detecting putative deleterious mutations is straightforward, discerning the individual impact of these variants remains complex. However, advancements in understanding the context of these mutations may facilitate the training of machine-learning models to predict and rank their effects, ultimately benefiting plant and animal breeding and research on complex human diseases. The findings suggest that the occurrence of specific mutations induced by chemical mutagens can be anticipated, enhancing our comprehension of mutagen-induced genetic diversity and its phenotypic implications.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Mutagens can quickly generate novel, heritable genetic variation for identifying gene function when naturally occurring variation will not suffice. Sodium azide (NaN3), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and fast neutron (FN) radiation have been the most commonly used mutagens in plants. Sodium azide and EMS are chemical mutagens expected to cause point mutations [1]. FN is known for generating many large structural variants and small indels (especially deletions) that generate frameshifts that disrupt gene function [2,3]. Mutagenizing agents have been used in many species to create knockouts or knockdowns of individual genes to understand gene function [4]. Despite decades of active use [5,6] and growing interest in the applications of mutagenesis [7,8], the characterization of the nature of the mutations generated has been limited [9]. More generally, the number of studies examining the effects of mutagens at the nucleotide sequence level is limited [1,3,10,11]. The nature and context in which mutations occur are essential determinants of their likely functional impact [12,13]. Recently reported efforts to employ sodium azide mutagenesis on a massive scale (500,000 mutated lines) clarify the need for an improved understanding of the number and types of mutations likely to be generated [7]. We can characterize induced mutations by comparing newly generated (de novo) mutations to variants occurring naturally in untreated lines. However, there are essential considerations to minimize false positives when distinguishing between induced mutations and existing variants. One challenge with identifying induced de novo changes is that the mutations are always a mixture of induced de novo and spontaneously occurring mutations [13]. The experimental design necessary to study induced mutations in plant populations requires multiple generations of seed bulking before the mutagenesis treatment and several generations in which new mutations are made homozygous in inbred lines; thus, multiple generations in which new spontaneous variants can arise [3]. Mutagenesis experiments often use multiple generations of self-fertilization to ensure that mutations are meiotically heritable [14]. Mutagen dosage also affects the nature of observable mutations, with an effective dosage of mutagens defined by the LD50, or lethal dose for 50% of the treated sample, which results in the death of half the individuals. Of course, this creates significant attrition due to lethal mutations, resulting in some mutations or combinations that cannot be observed directly. Observable mutations are less damaging, allowing the plant to survive and reproduce. New mutations, whether induced or naturally occurring, are more likely to be harmful than segregating variants subject to generations of natural (purifying) selection. More potentially harmful changes are observed among newer mutations in very deep resequencing panels [15] and induced mutations [3]. Newer mutations tend to include more changes of large effect, including nonsynonymous variants, changes in start and stop codons, intron splicing variants, and frameshifts [16,17]. Comparative approaches using phylogenetic constraint have been used for decades to predict which mutations are more likely to harm the organism [18,19]. More recent studies of induced mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that these approaches accurately identify phenotype-changing variants and are more likely to have a major effect on organismal fitness [20]. Thus, predicting the harmfulness of mutations has the potential to identify the nature of variants most likely to impact organismal fitness or yield in crops [21–23]. In barley, sodium azide primarily generates cytosine-to-thymine changes [24]. More recent studies have determined that mutagens create unique suites of mutations and that these mutations typically occur in a specific, immediate nucleotide context [1,13]. This observation is important because the nature of mutations, particularly when they occur predominantly in the presence of flanking motifs, can determine their relative effect. For example, C → T transitions, particularly in specific local sequence contexts, may limit the potential for mutagens to generate premature stop codons, even when the reverse complement of a mutation motif is considered. [24] identified sodium azide mutations in the barley Ant18 gene, finding that A.T → G.C base-pair transitions were most frequently generated. However, resequencing this single barley gene does not capture the effects of sodium azide at the whole-genome scale. In the present study, we examine sodium azide-induced mutations in 11 mutagenized lines of Morex, the barley variety used as the primary reference genome [25]. We also generated whole-genome sequence for a sample of the Morex seed stock used for mutagenesis. In addition to single nucleotide changes, we find evidence of sequence insertions and deletions (indels) private to each mutagenized line. Mutations identified in sodium azide-treated lines were compared to variants in 13 barley landrace samples subject to whole-genome sequencing. To understand the nature of mutations induced by sodium azide, we address the following questions: 1) What is the nature of the variants induced by the mutagen? More specifically, does sodium azide tend to generate SNPs, indels, or other types of structural variants? 2) What is the observed mutation rate in sodium azide-treated samples in barley? 3) Do induced variants differ in type or predicted effect from variants occurring in untreated individuals? and 4) Is a greater number of harmful mutations associated with a reduction in yield in barley? Data collected and analyzed in the present study includes three distinct datasets. First, we used multiple resequencing datasets to identify differences in our Morex samples and the Morex reference genome. This included new Illumina paired-end data with 10X Genomics linked reads, as well as both new and previously published Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and published Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequence [25] (Tables 1 and S1). A second data set included lines treated with sodium azide that were resequenced with Illumina paired-end data; for a subset of these lines also generated linked reads and ONT DNA sequencing data (S1 Table). We used this data to identify single nucleotide and structural variant differences between our Morex line published Morex_v3 reference genome [25]. We then identified mutations in lines subject to mutagenesis. For contrast between variants in mutagen-treated lines and naturally occurring variants, we used Illumina paired-end data to identify spontaneous variants in 13 barley landraces. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t001 A major challenge in isolating de novo variants induced by the mutagen treatment is the need to distinguish between variants present in the mutagenized seed stock (i.e., Morex) and those that arise during mutagenesis. Heterogeneity, genetic variation within an inbred cultivar or variety, can contribute large numbers of variants [26] that are not due to the mutagen. Experimental contamination through unintended hybridization [3,27] can also contribute to large numbers of variants (S1 Fig). Mutagen-induced variants are expected to be relatively rare, requiring filtering of the variants that account for: (1) differences between the parental line used for mutagenesis and the reference genome, (2) uncallable regions (see Materials & Methods) that include genomic regions with unknown nucleotide state in the reference, or the regions where sequence reads do not align uniquely, and (3) heterogeneity among lines (S2 and S3 Figs). We identified callable portions of the genome that were 820 Mb and 817 Mb (the latter excludes low complexity sequence) relative to the 4.2 Gb genome size for Morex_v3 [25]. Callable regions capture 88% of high-confidence (HC) genes (31,625 HC genes out of 35,827 total HC genes) in the Morex_v3 reference genome. No individuals in our experiment show an excess of variants, runs of variants, or high heterozygosity consistent with recent hybridization [27]. Differences between the Morex_v3 reference genome and our Morex sample are mutations that have arisen in individual seed stocks, errors in the reference assembly, or errors in variant calling. To address these issues, we generated 10X Genomics-based resequencing with 46x and an ONT data set with 5x average mapped read coverage (S1 Table). We identified 52,596 SNPs, 8,203 1-bp indels (insertions and deletions), 3,182 indels ranging in size from 2-204 bp, and 53 deletions ranging from 41 bp - 60 Kbp that survived rigorous filtering (S2 and S3 Figs). Filtered ONT variant calls include 68 insertions and 42 deletions. Using published ONT (at 85x coverage) and PacBio data (at 27x coverage) sampled from 100 seedlings [25] (Table 1) that were incorporated in the Morex_v3 assembly, we detected an additional 178 insertions and 93 deletions that were excluded from callable regions. Reference-based read mapping, variant calling in GATK [17,28,29], and filtering of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines identified 23,339 SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) with an observed transition to transversion ratio (Ts/Tv) = 5.24. This compares to a ratio of Ts/Tv = 1.7 previously reported based on resequencing of naturally occurring variants in barley [17]. Among mutagenized lines, we also identified 5,376 smaller indels ranging in size from 1 - 296 bp for 28,715 variants potentially induced by the mutagen (Fig 1A). Here, we use SNV (Single Nucleotide Variants) to identify variants generated during mutagenesis and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) to identify variants segregating in the non-mutagenized population. Each variant is private to a mutagenized plant (i.e., occurs in only a single individual). There was an average of 2,122 SNVs and 489 indels per mutated sample, with more indels identified in 10X Genomics samples utilizing linked reads (Fig 1B and Table 2). Those numbers are much higher (17x and 139x) than estimates of the average number of mutations that would spontaneously arise in the absence of a single-generation of sodium azide treatment. Those estimates were calculated as below (see Materials & Methods). Using the mean nucleotide substitution rate estimate of 6.5 x 10-9 base substitutions per site per generation from [30] and accounting for our experimental design, we expect ~124 SNVs per individual in the 4.2 Gbp genome. For indels, we expect ~3.5 indels per individual to arise without the mutagen treatment based on an average indel mutation rate of 0.45 x 10-9 for 1–3 bp indels and 0.5 x 10-9 for >3 bp indels [30]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t002 The ONT sequence and 10X Genomics linked reads of the same three mutagenized lines improved the detection of larger structural variants (SVs). No inversions passed the filtering criteria, and a set of high-quality duplications could not be identified; thus, structural variant calling focused on insertions and deletions. The SVs detected in the 10X Genomics data set included 52 deletions ranging from 41 bp to 60 Kbp (S4 Fig). ONT reads for three samples (S1 Table) were generated to validate the larger structural variants identified in the 10X Genomics data. The average ONT mapped read coverage was 3.4x (S1 Table). A total of 86 insertions (36–4,786 bp) and 26 deletions (36–300 bp) were called by Sniffles2; 8 insertions (21–172 bp) and 6 deletions (16–116 bp) were called by cuteSV (S4 and S5 Figs). These ONT calls provided direct sequence read-based confirmation of two larger deletion calls that were also called based on the 10X Genomics data set. For comparison, we generated whole-genome resequencing of 13 barley landraces [31]. Average coverage ranged from 41 - 93x (S1 Table), and after variant calling and quality filtering, we identified a total of 6.7 million SNPs with Ts/Tv = 1.74 and 849,618 indels ranging in size from 1 - 388 bp. Out of the 6,746,637 SNPs, 2,277,853 SNPs were categorized as rare (i.e., non-reference allele count of two or less, the allele was identified in one or two genotypes) with Ts/Tv = 1.71 and 4,468,784 were common (i.e., non-reference allele count of three or higher) with Ts/Tv = 1.76 (Fig 1A). Rare variants were compared to de novo variants in the treated lines because they have experienced fewer generations of selection, and their mutational spectrum is likely more similar to that in treated lines. SNPs in untreated samples are primarily transitions, particularly C → T* (Fig 2), where the notation C → T* includes the reverse complement G → A. Partitioning variants in the untreated samples into “rare” or “common” had a limited effect on the proportion of variants among each class, with a slight skew of rare variants to more C → T* transitions and fewer A → G*. Variants in sodium azide-treated lines were dominated by C → T* transitions, which comprised 79.1% of all SNVs in the mutagenized lines (Fig 2). Each bin includes the reverse complement. For example, the C → T* bin also includes G → A changes. Each bin includes the reverse complement. For example, the C → T* bin also includes G → A changes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g002 Single base pair changes dominate insertion and deletion variants, particularly in sodium-azide treated lines, constituting 28.3% of insertions and 36.4% of deletions (Fig 3). The pattern of indels in treated lines is similar to that in rare and common variants in standing variation. Notable differences include more 1- and 2-bp deletions and 1-bp insertions in treated lines (Fig 3). The 53 larger deletions (41 bp - 60 Kbp) called in the 10X Genomics data set represent roughly 1.7% of all 3,135 deletions in the mutated lines. Linked and long read sequencing was not possible for the landrace lines, precluding a direct comparison. Insertions are shown as positive values and deletions are shown as negative values. Only variants with lengths <20 bp are shown here. Insertions are shown as positive values and deletions are shown as negative values. Only variants with lengths <20 bp are shown here. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g003 In mutated samples, 9.7% of SNVs and 8.9% of indels occur in genic regions (S6 Fig). The percentage of variants in genic regions is lower in untreated lines for rare and common variants. Rare variants had 6.5% SNPs and 1.7% indels occurring in genic regions and are more directly comparable with mutated sample SNVs and indels. Variant Effect Predictor (VeP) [32] identified most sodium azide-induced variants as occurring in intergenic regions or genomic regions up or downstream of genes. A larger proportion of variants were found in intergenic regions among induced variants than in untreated lines. Fewer sodium azide-induced SNVs and indels were adjacent to genes (S7 and S8 Figs). Sodium azide-treated lines have a slightly higher proportion of missense variants (3.86%) than untreated lines (2.19% Rare, 2.32% Common), but this effect is small. Slight increases in the proportion of start-stop-related changes (0.2% Mutated, 0.09% Rare, and 0.07% Common) and splice donor and acceptor sites are also observed (0.09% Mutated, 0.01% Rare, and 0.01% Common). However, these variants are considered the most potentially damaging based on VeP categorization (S7 and S8 Figs). Larger deletion variants (41 bp - 60 Kbp) detected among the three lines with linked reads disrupt a genic region in 11.3% of cases (6 out of 53 total). On average, sodium azide-treated lines include 78.6 nonsynonymous SNVs per sample, with 865 nonsynonymous SNVs identified among the 11 mutated lines (S9 Fig). Estimates of putative variant effects based on phylogenetic constraints [20] were used to identify potentially damaging nonsynonymous variants among primary transcripts in the barley genome. This analysis includes missense variants (a change in amino acid), start lost, stop gained, and stop lost variants based on the Sequence Ontology definition of nonsynonymous changes [33]. For the 11 mutated lines, 611 nonsynonymous mutations in primary transcripts were tested for phylogenetic constraint relative to 72 other angiosperms to identify potentially universally harmful mutations. Among the successfully annotated mutations, 155 (35.9%) were annotated as “harmful” (i.e., putatively deleterious), while the remaining 277 (64.1%) were identified as “tolerated.” This value compares to 9,716 “rare” nonsynonymous variants tested in 13 barley landraces, where 1,633 (13.2%) are identified as “harmful” and 10,693 (86.8%) as tolerated. For “common nonsynonymous variants, 14,537 were tested, where 23,506 (7%) are “harmful,” and 311,121 (93%) are tolerated. An average of 14.1 (± 6.46) deleterious SNVs were identified per mutagenized sample (S10 Fig). Given that these changes at conserved coding positions are frequently phenotype-changing [20], this suggests roughly 14 disrupted SNVs per individual treated line. The ratio of nonsynonymous SNVs (nSNV) to synonymous SNVs (sSNV) in mutated lines is 1.8:1. In comparison, the ratio of nSNVs:sSNVs in rare and common SNP categories is 1.36:1 and 1.22:1, respectively. The proportion of nSNVs inferred to be deleterious was 17.9% in treated lines versus nSNPs at 3.2% in rare and 4.1% in common categories. To standardize results among samples, we identified the number of harmful mutations per codon in 10 Mbp windows. The proportion of dSNPs per codon was lower near the centromeres for rare and common SNPs in the landraces (S11-S13 Figs). Biochemical interactions between mutagenic compounds and DNA produce SNVs in specific nucleotide contexts [13]. We used the program Mutation Motif [9] for all SNVs to examine this effect in sodium azide-treated barley lines. The predominant mutation types in both treated and untreated lines are C → T* changes. In sodium azide-treated lines, the cytosine that changes to thymine is frequently followed by another cytosine, creating a CC context of mutation on the forward strand (Fig 4). To our knowledge, there have not been previous studies on the preferential context of sodium azide mutations. There are highly significant differences between sodium azide-induced variants and variants spontaneously originating in the genome (S2 Table). In untreated lines, the mutated cytosine is generally followed by guanine at the + 1 or +2 site (downstream) from the C, thus resulting in a CG or potentially CGG context in which mutations occur. In the complete 4.2 Gb Morex_v3 genome assembly, the CC, CG (the two bp motif for CpG changes), and CGG motifs occur ~228 million, ~ 154 million, and ~40 million times, respectively. In the 820 Mb region in which unique single nucleotide variants could be called, CC occurs ~48 million times, CG occurs ~35 million times, and CGG motifs occur ~9 million times. This suggests that, on average, a single generation of sodium azide treatment resulted in the mutation of 0.013% of CC sites at which unique mutations could be detected. The CC and CG motifs constitute 5.8% and 4.3% of all two nucleotide combinations in the 820 Mb callable regions, and the CGG motif constitutes 1.1% of three nucleotide combinations. In contrast, AA and TT motifs are the most frequent two nucleotide motifs, making up 8.1%. Position 0 indices where the C → T change occurred. The relative height of the letters indicates their relative entropy (RE), with a higher RE indicating a position has a greater influence on the mutation. Upright letters indicate overrepresented bases, whereas upside-down letters indicate underrepresented bases at positions neighboring position 0. The null expectation (RE of zero) is based on randomly sampling a nearby location with the same starting base (e.g., for a C → T mutation, a random choice of a position with a C is selected. Position 0 indices where the C → T change occurred. The relative height of the letters indicates their relative entropy (RE), with a higher RE indicating a position has a greater influence on the mutation. Upright letters indicate overrepresented bases, whereas upside-down letters indicate underrepresented bases at positions neighboring position 0. The null expectation (RE of zero) is based on randomly sampling a nearby location with the same starting base (e.g., for a C → T mutation, a random choice of a position with a C is selected. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g004 Amino acid changes identified in sodium azide-treated lines are dominated by those that include the CC or (reverse complement) GG motif (S14 Fig). Glycine to aspartic acid, proline to serine, and alanine to threonine are the three most abundant amino acid changes in SNVs identified as harmful (i.e., deleterious) (Table 3 and S15 Fig). The top four changes in tolerated SNVs (tSNVs) in mutagenized samples are similar to those annotated as harmful; tolerated amino acid changes include alanine to threonine, alanine to valine, glycine to aspartic acid, and proline to serine (Table 3). This contrasts with amino acid changes induced by rare and common variants in standing variation, where transitions associated with CpG are more abundant. For rare and common dSNPs, alanine-to-threonine and alanine-to-valine changes appear at the highest frequencies. The arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change had the third highest frequency in the common dSNPs class and frequently annotates as deleterious. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t003 A total of 25 mutagenized barley lines self-fertilized for five to seven generations (M5:7) were used for yield testing at one location in the first year (St. Paul, MN) and three locations in Minnesota (Crookston, Lamberton, and St. Paul) in years 2 and 3. Yield testing was performed in the presence of 5–8 check lines (see Materials and Methods) and the original Morex line untreated with the mutagen. Data for heading days after planting (DAP) and plant height were also collected. After spatial adjustment for variation across plots, the average yield for each line was calculated for all years combined. As expected, most mutagenized lines had lower grain yields than the Morex W2017 parental line, with six mutagenized lines yielding roughly the same or slightly higher than the parental line (Fig 5). M29 is among the three lowest-yielding lines and is the only mutagenized line with a visibly distinct phenotype, described as onion-like, short-stature, and very compact (S16 Fig). Mutagenized lines tend to have diminished yield relative to Morex, though some line-by-year combinations slightly exceeded the yield in Morex and some checks (S17 Fig). The average diminution in yield across years and lines for the mutagenized lines was 32.8% relative to the Morex W2017 parent. The heading DAP in mutagenized lines increased by 6.2%, and height was reduced by 15% compared to the Morex W2017 parent line. To determine if observed damaging mutations impacted yield, we compared the relative order of yield to the number of damaging mutations per line. We found a slightly negative but nonsignificant correlation of -0.28 (P = 0.4) between the number of harmful variants and yield (S3 Table). Most mutagenized lines had lower variance across replicates than the check lines. This is likely due to the experimental design with seeds originating from plants that can be traced through single-seed descent following the mutagen treatment, whereas check lines derive from more heterogeneous seed stocks.

It has been frequently used for inducing variants in barley [24,34], including recent reports of extremely large-scale experiments involving the characterization of hundreds of thousands of individual plants [7]. Other mutagens used historically have included X-rays, neutrons, ethylene imine, sulfonates, other chemical mutagens, and various combinations of mutagens [detailed in 35]. However, most studies have focused on the phenotypic effects of mutagenesis [4,36,37] or changes induced at individual genes [24]. The genome-level effects of the mutagen have rarely been examined. Consistent with a prior single gene resequencing study, we find that C → T* transitions dominate induced mutations [7,24,38] (Fig 2). A similar pattern of nucleotide change has been found for ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) induced mutation [10,39]. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced mutations in mice produce primarily A → G* or A → T* mutations [13]. In contrast, C → T* transitions predominate among the variants observed after fast neutron treatment, but with less enrichment relative to other SNVs [3,10]. Sodium azide appears to generate single nucleotide variants primarily. We identify an average of 2,122 SNVs per mutagenized line. This is an ~ 88-fold increase in SNVs compared to expectations in the absence of a single-generation sodium azide treatment (see Materials and Methods for equations 1–6). Induced indels of all sizes are less abundant (Figs 1 and 3) but occur at ~130–140 fold higher rate than nominal mutation rates. The observation of higher indel rates derives from the comparison of data from multiple sequencing platforms, including linked-reads and long-read sequencing, with an average of 489 indels per line in mutagenized M5 lines. The mutations present in M5 lines are necessarily a mixture of induced mutations and mutations that arose spontaneously during line maintenance [13]. However, based on mutation accumulation resequencing studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, the 1–3 bp mutation rate was estimated as an average of 0.45 x 10-9 indels per site per generation, and the large deletions (>3 bp) mutation rate was estimated as 0.5 x 10-9 [30]. In the 820 Mb portion of the barley genome, where variants can be called unambiguously, we expect ~3.5 indels per individual to arise naturally without mutagenesis treatment over the course of the experiment (see Methods for equations 1–6). In the 4.2 Gbp barley genome, we would expect ~18 indels per individual (Fig 1B). This is a ~ 130–140-fold increase in the indel mutation rate of treated lines to an average of 5.13 x 10-7 indels per site per generation. Most sodium azide-induced mutations occur in a specific nucleotide sequence context, as C → T* changes in a CC mutation motif (Fig 4) or the reverse complement. This results in a relatively small number of amino acid changes that predominate among induced mutations. [10] describe similar results for mutations found after EMS or EMS/ENU treatment, where the most common changes within codons produce only a fraction of all possible amino acid changes. In a similar manner, sodium azide-induced amino acid changes are very distinct from most amino acid changes segregating in barley. The amino acid changes that annotate as harmful and predominate in the mutagenized samples are glycine to aspartic acid, proline to serine, and alanine to threonine. In comparison, the top three amino acid changes annotated as harmful and segregating in the untreated barley landraces include alanine to threonine, alanine to valine, and arginine to cysteine. For projects seeking to induce novel changes, for example, in disease resistance genes or genes associated with stress tolerance, sodium azide will induce many coding changes that are rarely observed among standing variation. Resequencing of individual genes identified many sodium azide-induced SNVs in barley [24]. Induced indels and SVs were not previously reported but would be difficult to identify with Sanger sequencing. Indeed, sequencing technology continues to present a limitation. Many of the SVs identified here were identified by linked reads (in two cases verified by ONT long reads) but could not be identified by Illumina paired-end reads alone. Regarding relative effect, indels and SVs identified with linked reads and verified with ONT result in six disruptive mutations that either induce a frameshift or eliminate a portion of a coding gene. This results in an average of two structural disruptions of genes per individual instead of an average of 33.4 per individual due to 1–3 bp nucleotide sequence-level changes. Our mutated lines average a 37.7% reduction in yield relative to their non-mutated parental Morex line. This reduction in yield can be attributed to an average of 14.1 induced SNVs and 37.3 indels per line. The typical line has an average of 249.1 disruptions of coding variants, including SNVs and indels (S6 Fig). The approach used in this study identified a finite number of deleterious (i.e., harmful) mutations induced by sodium azide. It was successful at creating lines that had lower yield than the untreated Morex parent line in the experiment. The reduction in fitness (using yield as a proxy for fitness) following the mutagen treatment was expected, given that most new amino-acid-changing mutations that impact fitness will be deleterious [16,40]. In practical applications, deleterious variants are relatively easy to detect, which makes it possible to select against them or eliminate them via targeted replacement of individual variants [22,23,41,42]. However, it is still challenging to identify the effects of individual deleterious variants. With lines that have reduced yield and a better understanding of the nature of changes generated by sodium azide and the sequence contexts in which they occur, there is the possibility of training machine-learning models to predict which variants contribute to harmful phenotypic change [43,44]. Then, quantify the effect size of each harmful variant into a ranked list and combine the predictions with existing genomic prediction approaches to benefit plant and animal breeding programs [45] and the study of complex human diseases. All of these applications require a means to identify the most harmful variants. Barley from a Morex seed stock was treated with sodium azide following the protocol in [46]. Morex is a 6-row malting barley variety used as the primary reference genome [25]. Morex was chosen for these experiments to facilitate the identification and isolation of de novo variants because the reference makes it easier to distinguish between variants that are different between our parent sample and the reference genome versus variants that arose from the mutagen. The Morex line in this experiment traces back to the parent seed stock used to generate the Steptoe x Morex doubled haploid barley mapping population [47]. To generate sufficient Morex seeds for sodium azide mutagenesis, 120 seeds were planted from a single Morex plant (S1 Fig). Next, 200 seeds from the resulting bulk of seeds were planted; this was repeated one more time. A portion of the seeds was treated with sodium azide (1 mM NaN3) following the [46] protocol; the remaining portion of untreated Morex seeds was planted for another round of seed bulking and then planted to collect leaf tissue for sequencing (S1 Fig). After mutagenesis, the resulting mutagenized seeds were grown to maturity and harvested, forming the M1 generation. These individuals then underwent single-seed descent until M5. Estimates for the expected number of spontaneous mutations occurring without mutagen treatment were calculated using the experimental design for seven generations of self-fertilization (S1 Fig) and rate estimates from [30]. The mutation rates used for SNPs was and for 1–3 bp indels was . For the 820 Mbp (820,594,305 bp) callable regions, a diploid genome size of 1,641,188,610 bp was used. For estimates of the 4.2 Gbp (4,225,605,719 bp) genome size [25], a diploid genome size of 8,451,211,438 bp was used. Each generation, new mutations appear in the heterozygous state, and the number of new heterozygous mutations (Nhet) is given by The experimental design involved multiple generations of selfing, meaning de novo mutations from previous generations are being lost or fixed over time. In each generation, heterozygous mutations are inherited (Ihet) and are represented by where x is the current generation. Similarly, each generation homozygous mutations are inherited (Ihom) and are represented by The number of heterozygous and homozygous spontaneous mutations accumulated by generation seven in our experimental design is given by and is used as our estimated number of spontaneous mutations that would have been present without mutagen treatment. Twenty-five M5:7 mutated lines and F1:2 W2017 Morex parent line were evaluated in yield trials with two replicates at one location (St. Paul, MN) in 2020 and three locations in Minnesota (Crookston, Lamberton, and St. Paul) in 2021 and 2022. Lines were grown in a randomized complete block design. Phenotypic data on grain yield, heading days after planting (DAP), height, and lodging were collected. Check varieties were used to adjust for spatial variation across trial plots for traits with a continuous scale (yield, heading DAP, and height). Spatial adjustments were performed using the R package mvngGrAd [48]. Check lines were chosen because of well-qualified field performance and included Conlon, FEG141–20, Lacey, ND20448, ND26104, ND_Genesis, Pinnacle, and Rasmusson. We generated whole-genome sequencing in 25 barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) accessions: the parent of the mutagenized lines (W2017 Morex), 11 mutagenized lines, and 13 barley landraces [31] for comparative analyses (Tables 1 and S1). High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from 4-6 week-old leaf tissue collected on ice using the Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit for the mutagenized lines. We sequenced three of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines (M01, M20, and M29) and the W2017 Morex line using the 10X Genomics linked read library preparation followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 40x. For the remaining eight M5 mutagenized lines (M02, M11, M14, M28, M35, M36, M39, and M41), libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 16x. Sequences for the 13 landraces were generated using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano Prep followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 40x. We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to sequence W2017 Morex and three of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines (M01, M20, and M29, see Tables 1 and S1). This data was collected to provide read-level confirmation of SVs indicated by the Illumina short-read resequencing. For sample M01, following the ONT protocol, a high molecular weight gDNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen Genomic-tip kit (10262) with Carlson Lysis buffer (10450002–1). High molecular weight gDNA extractions for samples M20 and M29 were generated using the NucleoBond HMW DNA kit (740160.20) from Takara Bio USA. Size selection was performed using Circulomics SRE buffer, and DNA was quantified using the Qubit assay. The libraries were prepared with 400 ng of gDNA using the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004) following the protocol version RSE_9046_v1_revT_14Aug2019. The library was primed using the flow cell priming kit (EXP-FLP002), then 400 ng of the library was loaded onto an R9.4.1 flow cell (FLO-MIN106D). M01 was run for 72 hours on a MinION Mk1C (MIN-101C). We found the flow cells were no longer collecting new data after 24 hours and modified the run for the remaining two samples. For M20 and M29, 400 ng of the library was loaded onto an R9.4.1 flow cell, run for 12 hours, and then paused. At this point, the pores were cleared using the flow cell wash kit (EXP-WSH004), then 400 ng of additional library was loaded and run for another 12 hours before the run was paused. Again, pores were cleared with the flow cell wash kit, then 400 ng of an additional library was loaded. The flow cell was run for an additional 24–30 hours. Three reactions were run for a single flow cell; a single sample with two washes ran for a total of 48–56 hours. This approach produced the highest data output for our samples. This process was repeated until each mutagenized line was sequenced to a target depth of 2-3x (S1 Table). Basecalling was performed using Guppy v5.0.12 + eb1a981 (for all runs except one) and Guppy v5.0.17 + 99baa5b (for one M01 run #3) using the default setting on the MinION Mk1C. Read alignment and variant calling for the eight mutagenized and 13 landrace WGS lines were processed using the sequence_handling workflow (https://github.com/MorrellLAB/sequence_handling), which integrates publicly available software into a series of bash scripts [49]. The configuration files, which identify software versions and parameters, and scripts are available in the GitHub repositories https://github.com/MorrellLAB/hybrid_barley and https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated. Reads were aligned against the third version of the barley Morex reference genome (Morex_v3) [25] with parameters adjusted to account for the level of nucleotide diversity in barley. Variants were called as part of a larger set of samples and followed the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices recommendations [28,29]. SNPs underwent GATK VariantRecalibrator with the following as input: filtered variants and SNPs from genotyping assays, which include 2,975 BOPA SNPs [50], 7,541 9K SNPs [51], and 41,813 50K SNPs [52]. Only polymorphic and biallelic SNPs were included. Additional SNP filtering criteria include allele balance [53,54] deviation of 0.1, proportion heterozygous genotypes at a site > 0.1, per sample minimum DP < 5, per sample maximum DP > 158, proportion missing genotypes at a site > 0.30, QUAL < 30, and GQ < 9. SNPs identified in a barley Sanger resequencing dataset [55,56] were used for validation. Indels were filtered following GATK’s Best Practices Guidelines for hard filtering since we did not have enough truth and training datasets to run indels through VariantRecalibrator. All filtering criteria are detailed in the scripts available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated. For the four 10X Genomics samples (W2017 Morex and three mutagenized lines, see S1 Table), reads were aligned to the Morex v3 reference genome, and variants were called with the 10X Genomics software, Long Ranger v2.2.2. The Long Ranger pipeline processes the Chromium-prepared sequencing samples. Variants were filtered based on filters generated by Long Ranger, which include: 10X_QUAL_FILTER, 10X_ALLELE_FRACTION_FILTER, 10X_PHASING_INCONSISTENT, 10X_HOMOPOLYMER_UNPHASED_INSERTION, 10X_RESCUED_MOLECULE_HIGH_DIVERSITY, and LOWQ. SNPs and 1-bp indels were filtered to sites with per sample DP between 5 and 78 and an allele balance deviation of +/- 0.2 (from the expected 0.5) for heterozygous genotypes. For the ONT data of W2017 Morex, M01, M20, and M29, read quality and summary statistics were generated with NanoPlot v1.38.1 and pycoQC [57]. Adapters were trimmed with Porechop v0.2.4 [58]. Reads were then aligned to the barley Morex v3 reference genome using Minimap2 v2.17 [59] with parameters recommended for ONT sequence reads. The resulting SAM files were then realigned using a modified version of the Vulcan pipeline [60] (customized version, https://gitlab.com/ChaochihL/vulcan), which utilizes NGMLR [61] for read realignment, converted to BAM format, and sorted using Samtools v1.9 [62]. Structural variants were then called using Sniffles v2.0.3 [61,63]. We also used a publicly available Morex individual sequenced with PacBio CCS reads (BioProject PRJEB40587, ERR numbers ERR4659245-ERR4659249) [25]. We used HiFiAdapterFilt [64] to filter adapters. Reads were aligned using Minimap2 v2.17 [59] using parameters recommended for PacBio sequence reads. Similar to the ONT data, the resulting SAM files were realigned using a modified version of the Vulcan pipeline [60] (customized version, https://gitlab.com/ChaochihL/vulcan), converted to BAM format, and sorted using Samtools v1.9 [62]. Structural variants were called used Sniffles v2.0.3 [61,63]. For all datasets in this study, mapped coverage was estimated using Mosdepth v0.3.1 [65]. All mapping parameters and filtering criteria are detailed in scripts available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated). To identify de novo variants induced by the mutagen, we generated a list of regions where variants were called in Morex-sample2 (W2017 Morex); these are differences between the Morex parent in this study and the Morex reference genome. Variants called in the [25] Morex ONT and PacBio data were also counted as differences from the reference; these are potentially due to heterogeneity (variation among individuals in the Morex variety). To minimize spurious SV calls in difficult-to-call regions for the 10X Genomics, ONT, and PacBio data, we filtered out variants that overlap with uncallable regions, which includes annotated repeats, stretches of N’s in the reference genome sequence, and “high copy” regions (i.e., regions where plastids, rDNA repeats, and centromere repeats align). For the ONT and 10X Genomics data, SVs that overlap low complexity regions (defined as regions containing low-copy sequence) were also filtered out because they can be non-biological artifactual sequences that result in unmapped sequences or sequences mapped to multiple locations. Low complexity regions were generated using BBMask from BBTools (BBMap – Bushnell B. – sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) with entropy set at 0.7, which was determined through data exploration to capture a majority of low complexity sequences (scripts available at https://github.com/MorrellLAB/morex_reference/tree/master/morex_v3). For the ONT and PacBio data, SVs were filtered out if they had less than five supporting reads. For Morex-sample2, SNPs in 100 bp windows with >2% diversity were filtered out. Such high diversity windows are unlikely when aligning Morex-sample2 to the Morex reference genome. SVs were then visually inspected in IGV or scored in SV-plaudit (in the case of the 10X Genomics larger deletions), and filtering criteria were tuned if necessary (summarized in S2 Fig). The filtered SVs form a high confidence set of places where de novo variants shouldn’t be called due to regions that are difficult to align or are heterogeneous among Morex individuals. For the 10X Genomics and ONT sequenced mutagenized lines (M01, M20, M29), SVs that overlap uncallable regions or low complexity regions were filtered out (S3 Fig). To benefit from using the strengths of distinct SV callers for ONT data, we utilize Sniffles2 [60] and cuteSV [66]. SVs called by cuteSV and Sniffles2 in the ONT data were filtered similarly, except in the Sniffles2 calls, we required at least five supporting reads. For all sequenced mutagenized lines (10X Genomics, ONT, and Illumina WGS), variants that overlap the “differences from reference” regions were filtered out (summarized in S2 Fig). SNPs identified in the mutagenized samples that also appear in the BOPA (Barley Oligo Pooled Assay 1 and 2) on the Illumina Golden Gate genotyping platform [50], Barley 9K Illumina Infinium iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChip [67], and Barley 50K iSelect SNP array [52] panels were also excluded. Variants were filtered to those private to individual mutagenized samples, meaning the variant only exists in one of the mutagenized samples at a genomic position. This is based on the expectation that variants induced by the mutagen are new (arose after the mutagen treatment was applied) and unique to each individual. So, variants identified in the mutagenized lines that also exist in the Morex samples are likely due to heterogeneity in Morex and were not generated by the mutagen treatment. Again, variants were visually inspected in IGV [68] or igv-reports (https://github.com/igvteam/igv-reports), and filtering criteria were tuned if necessary. An image scoring approach was used to verify the larger deletions in the 10X Genomics three mutagenized samples. Images of the SVs were created with the SamPlot software [69]. Following the pipeline implemented in SV-Plaudit [70], the SV images were stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud storage and scored by multiple investigators through the PlotCritic website (https://github.com/jbelyeu/PlotCritic) based on the following criteria: coverage, insert size, and linked/split read evidence. This produced a set of scored deletions where a majority of scorers confirmed read evidence for the variant. This confirmed variant set was then verified using the ONT-sequenced samples (M01, M20, and M29). Mutation Motif [9] was used to identify the most frequent sequence motifs that affect SNPs in the mutated, rare, and common variant classes. This program performs comparative statistical analyses of neighborhoods (5 bp windows) centered around each SNP to identify the frequency of sequence motifs and the influence of neighboring bases for each SNP. The neighborhood of each SNP (e.g., C → T mutation) is compared to the neighborhood of a reference occurrence of the same nucleotide (e.g., C) randomly sampled from within +/- 100 bp of the mutation. Comparing the motifs associated with mutated, rare, and common classes of SNPs allowed us to identify specific motifs that sodium azide may preferentially target. The number of 2- and 3- bp motifs in the 4.2 Gb reference genome and 820 Mb callable regions was calculated using the EMBOSS [71] compseq tool. Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VeP) [32] was used to determine the predicted effect of each variant in the filtered VCF file, which includes SNPs, insertions, and deletions. Identification of nonsynonymous variants (includes missense, start lost, stop gained, and stop lost variants) used gene models provided by [25]. Nonsynonymous variants for the mutated samples and landraces were extracted from the VeP reports and assessed using BAD_Mutations [17,20], which includes a likelihood ratio test [72] that compares codon conservation across Angiosperm species to determine if a base substitution is likely to be deleterious. We ran the BAD_Mutations pipeline with a set of 72 Angiosperm species genome sequences that are available through Phytozome v13 (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/, last accessed November 29, 2021) and Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org/, last accessed November 29, 2021). We ran BAD_Mutations using 35,827 primary transcripts. A SNP was annotated as deleterious if the P-value for the test was < 0.05 with a multiple tests correction based on the number of tested codons, minimum of 10 sequences, maximum constraint of 1, and if the alternate or reference allele was not seen in any of the other species. Our thresholds for the three data groups were 8.1E-5 (611 codons tested) for the mutated samples, 5.1E-6 (9,716 codons tested) for the rare variants, and 3.4E-6 (14,537 codons tested) for the common variants. SNPs that failed this set of criteria were annotated as tolerated. Gx is the generation used for spontaneous mutation estimates (see Methods). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s001 (TIFF) These are regions where induced mutations should not be called as they are more likely to be variation among Morex individuals. Example screenshots from IGV are shown, from top to bottom: 1) A deletion called in ONT data in a region where the reference is missing - can’t be confirmed as a deletion, 2) Regions with excessively high diversity based on the expectations in the most diverse barley genes are excluded, these are more likely due to alignment issues rather than real variation, and 3) Read support for 10X Genomics called deletion with the same variant called in the ONT data providing additional support for the call. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s002 (TIFF) Larger SVs were visually evaluated with a similar approach as in part 1 of the filtering (S2 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s003 (TIFF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s004 (TIFF) Larger insertions were not called in the 10X Genomics dataset. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s005 (TIFF) A) A summary of the percentage and number of SNPs and indels in genic regions that can potentially disrupt genes for sodium azide-treated samples and rare vs. common categories.

Title: Meta Won’t Add Bitcoin To Balance Sheet As Shareholders Strongly Reject Treasury Proposal
URL: https://zycrypto.com/meta-wont-add-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-as-shareholders-strongly-reject-treasury-proposal/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T13:50:29Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have voted against a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. According to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an eye-popping 4.9 billion votes were cast in opposition while 3.92 million — a mere 0.08% of the total — supported the proposal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company’s voting power, an April regulatory statement reveals, which could mean that he voted down the idea. The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate. Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, has started offering a new bond product tied to Bitcoin’s price. Based on reports, only qualified investors can buy these bonds right now, and trading happens over the counter. The bank says it will soon list them on the Moscow Exchange to make them easier to buy and sell. These bonds pay out if Bitcoin rises in value, and they also give investors a bonus if the US dollar strengthens against the ruble. Investors deal in rubles, so there’s no need to own a crypto wallet or use foreign platforms. According to the bank’s press release, the bonds are for a limited group of investors at first. They plan to make them available on the Moscow Exchange soon. This move means more transparency and the chance for more people to get involved. If Bitcoin goes up, bondholders benefit. If the dollar goes up against the ruble, bondholders get a bit more too. It’s a double play on two markets, crypto and currency. Based on reports, Russia still bans cryptocurrencies for everyday payments, but they’re allowed for cross-border deals. In early June, the Central Bank of Russia gave financial firms the green light to sell crypto-related investments to qualified investors. That change paved the way for Sberbank’s new bonds. No one needs to leave Russia’s financial system to invest in Bitcoin this way, keeping it all above board and legal. Sberbank got a digital asset license from the Central Bank in 2022. Since then, they’ve tokenized assets like gold and real estate. They opened their platform to retail investors in 2023 and handled billions of rubles in transactions. The bank even launched a blockchain network that works with Ethereum. That network started limited testing in 2022 and opened to the public in early 2023. Now, they’re adding Bitcoin futures on June 4 through their SberInvestments platform. This comes just as the Moscow Exchange rolls out its own crypto-based trading tools. Around the world, big banks are moving into crypto. In the US, names like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are working on a stablecoin project to speed up cross-border payments. In Hong Kong, HSBC launched a crypto settlement product. BNY Mellon is putting money into blockchain to hold digital assets. In March, BlackRock created a tokenized fund on Ethereum and then added one on Solana. Sberbank’s bond ties into this trend, showing that major banks still see value in blending traditional finance with crypto tools.

Title: BlackRock Analyst Warns of Overexposure to US Markets, Says One Country On Right Side of Incoming ‘Tectonic Shifts’

The world’s largest asset manager says investors may want to think twice before betting the farm on US markets. In an interview with CNBC TV-18, Ben Powell, chief of Middle East & APAC at BlackRock Investment Institute, says he’s looking at other regions to invest in as uncertainty builds in the US due to a weakening dollar and trade tensions. Says Powell, “Having all your eggs in one basket, even a beautiful basket like the US, feels a bit riskier.” The analyst says BlackRock is looking at emerging markets like India as potential candidates to outperform the US, noting strong labor force growth, technology gains, heightened geopolitical relevance and favorable demographic trends. “We like India, yes. We think India is the right side of a lot of these huge tectonic shifts that we’re seeing. So India, in terms of the geopolitics… Clearly, India is of course a kind of continent-sized country and economy, and everyone wants to be friends with India. It’s neck and neck at the moment but potentially India’s GDP will be overtaking Japan’s relatively soon in the next few quarters… And I still think, if I can say so, what some of the foreigners still fail to understand is the amazing technological productivity advances we’ve seen in India over the last years.” However, Powell also concedes that BlackRock is still overweight US equities and doesn’t discount the possibility that the American stock market can rip higher from here, noting that artificial intelligence (AI) can be the “megaforce” that can act as a tailwind that offsets other concerns in the market.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SUQIAN, CHINA - MARCH 9, 2025 - An illustration photo shows the Broadcom LOGO displayed on a ... More smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China on March 9, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is scheduled to report its earnings on Thursday, June 5, 2025. Historically, AVGO stock has often seen a positive reaction to its earnings announcements. Over the past five years, the stock has posted positive one-day returns in a strong 80% of instances, with a median gain of 2.9% and a maximum one-day jump of 24.4%. While actual results will heavily influence stock performance, understanding these historical patterns can give event-driven traders an edge. Here are two main approaches: Analysts project Broadcom to report earnings of $1.57 per share on sales of $14.97 billion. This marks a significant improvement from the prior year’s quarter, which saw earnings of $1.10 per share on sales of $12.49 billion. This anticipated growth is expected to be fueled by the continued expansion of Broadcom’s AI-related custom chips and Ethernet products. Investors will also be closely watching trends in custom ASIC sales. From a fundamental standpoint, Broadcom currently boasts a market capitalization of $1.1 trillion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $55 billion in revenue and was operationally profitable, with $19 billion in operating profits and a net income of $10 billion. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Merck Stock’s Ticking Keytruda Time Bomb.See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. AVGO 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves "long" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. AVGO Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Broadcom stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just before Broadcom. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. AVGO Correlation With Peer Earnings Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like Broadcom, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Buy on the dip, purchase stock when price drop, trader signal to invest, make profit from market ... More collapse concept, smart businessman investor buy stock with down arrow graph. We’ve got a rare “delayed reaction” income play on our hands right now. Thanks to the April stock-market plunge, we can now pick up 12%+ dividends at attractive discounts. But I don’t expect this cheap CEF opportunity to last very long. I know early April feels like a while ago, but it created our opportunity, and the chance to buy is still available today. It lies in closed-end funds (CEFs). (I’ll show you three that pay those outsized 12%+ yields in just a second.) In a nutshell, these three funds trade at discounts to their portfolio values—known as “net asset value,” or NAV, in CEF-speak. And many of those discounts still haven’t recovered from the April “tariff terror.” When we buy a CEF at, say, a 10% discount to NAV, we’re essentially paying 90 cents on the dollar. As that gap narrows, we essentially profit twice: once from the fund’s high yield and again from the closing discount. Here’s the important part: These discounts are on the road to recovery. And their “discount momentum” positions us for gains, in addition to these three funds’ double-digit payouts. You simply won’t find such a profitable situation in the S&P 500. While the benchmark index has clawed its way back to around breakeven for 2025, the three funds we’ll get into next are still lagging, and that’s a gift for income investors like us. Let’s get into them. Our first fund is the Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR), with a 12.5% yield and a still-cheap valuation that’s unlikely to stay that way for long. JFR Discount NAV As you can see above, JFR’s discount plunged to within a hair of 12% when President Trump’s tariffs were unveiled. That deal has since been cut nearly in half, to 6.7%. That might make you think it’s too late to buy. Not at all—JFR’s discount hasn’t fully snapped back to where it was at the start of the year, so there’s still upside here. And the discount will likely fade, because JFR has had a great run. With a 31% total return in the last three years, JFR is bound to attract more investor attention, putting those who front run that crowd now in a strong position to gain. JFR mainly invests in senior loans, as well as corporate bonds that are below investment grade, with a focus on floating-rate credit. You do need skilled management to navigate these waters, but Chicago-based Nuveen, which traces its roots back to 1898, is among the best in the business. Moreover, senior loans are repaid ahead of all other obligations in the event of a bankruptcy, which helps offset their risk. But that’s not really an issue now, since corporate defaults are below their long-term average, despite the heavy markdown corporate bonds suffered in 2022, when investors thought they would see huge defaults. Since floating-rate loans (whose rates, as the name says, are linked to interest rates) still haven’t fully recovered from that selloff, they’re particularly compelling now, while default rates remain low. In all, JFR gives us a well-designed bond portfolio to diversify our holdings. The income and discount make the deal even sweeter. For something a bit more familiar, consider another Nuveen CEF: the Nuveen Multi-Asset Income Fund (NMAI). NMAI mixes investments in well-known stocks, like Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Apple (AAPL), with loans and bonds, resulting in a well-diversified portfolio that helps management cover the fund’s 13.6% dividend. Again, this diversification has been attracting investors, causing NMAI’s discount to dwindle. But we’re still getting a generous 9% markdown here. Investors who buy NMAI’s diversified portfolio get a big yield at a hefty markdown to the fund’s actual value; this is partly why the fund’s discount has been disappearing. This narrowing of the discount will likely continue, and good economic news could accelerate it, as we saw happen in June 2024 (the peak in the chart above). Let’s wrap with a “pure” stock fund packing a powerful 12.8% dividend: the abrdn Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (AOD). Like the two CEFs above, AOD is attracting more investment, which we can see happening in real time through its shrinking discount: AOD Discount NAV Still, AOD trades for far less than NAV, with a 9.7% discount that makes little sense given the fund’s huge yield and large cap holdings, like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tencent Holdings (TNCT). It also makes little sense for an investor to be able to get these stocks at such a big discount, which explains why that deal has been eroding. The bottom line here is that these 12%+ yielders are still catching up in the wake of April’s panic, making them worth a look for those with extra cash to put to work. But their shrinking discounts show the crowd is catching on, so you’ll need to act fast. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Waymo To Separate From Google?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/03/waymo-to-separate-from-google/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 11: A Waymo autonomous vehicle drives along Masonic Avenue on ... More April 11, 2022 in San Francisco, California. San Francisco is serving as testing grounds for autonomous vehicles with Waymo, a Google subsidiary and Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, logging millions of test miles throughout San Francisco in 2021. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Alphabet’s self-driving business, Waymo, has built up considerable momentum over the last few years. The company recently said that it was delivering about 250,000 autonomous rides per week, up from less than 10,000 rides per week less than two years ago. Unlike many robo-taxi upstarts that have faded or shifted focus, Waymo is actually scaling. With the company set to scale up operations in multiple new cities and mainstream acceptance of robotaxis picking up, Waymo might be on its way to becoming a key contender in shaping the future of urban transportation. That said, there are risks due to the startup’s uncertain unit economics and the ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet. Waymo is losing money - a lot of money. Waymo’s cash burn makes any forced separation of Waymo from Google - a question of Waymo’s survival. As such, we look into the cash burn first. Separately, see – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? Now, almost seven years since its launch, Waymo remains unprofitable. While Google does not break down Waymo’s financials, its Other Bets segment, which includes the robotaxi startup, posted a $4.4 billion loss over the last fiscal year. The cost base is high. Waymo owns the vehicles it operates, a contrast to ride hailing players such as Uber. Then, there are the costs tied to vehicle retrofitting, mapping, and fleet management. This means that Waymo has yet to demonstrate a path to profitability, even at the relatively large scale it is currently operating at. Waymo still loses money on every ride it delivers. This has meant that Waymo is burning through cash and remains dependent on external funding. Check out how Alphabet’s Operating Cash Flows compare to peers. Waymo has raised over $10 billion in the unit since its inception, with its most recent $5.6 billion Series C coming last year, led by Alphabet, along with marquee investors such as a16z, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. As Waymo’s growth accelerates, a new challenge could be looming in the form of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, which might result in the DOJ ordering a breakup of Alphabet’s sprawling portfolio. Granted, the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit primarily targets Google’s dominant position in the search and advertising space. But on a core level, the department might be focusing on how Alphabet’s current organizational structure helps it cement its overall dominance. See how Google’s Revenues have been trending. That puts units like Waymo directly in regulators’ sights, given that it is a loss-making business that benefits from Google’s capital, shared intelligence and analytics, and Google’s deep trove of data. There are ways that Waymo drives Google’s long-term strategy as well - think real data collection, AI advancement. The money-losing rides might also be seen as costly R&D spending that generates valuable real-world data. This is why Google continues to fund the company despite mixed economics. Waymo depends on Alphabet not just for funding but for technical resources, cloud computing, AI talent, and mapping data. Without Alphabet’s backing and ecosystem support, Waymo could face pressure to cut costs. The timing couldn’t be worse. EV and self-driving behemoth Tesla is set to ramp up deployments of its own robo-taxis shortly. Tesla has a massive installed base of vehicles on the road already, and it plans to allow owners of full-self-driving (FSD) Teslas to rent out their vehicles, when they aren’t being used, to its robo-taxi fleet. See - Buy or Sell Tesla stock. This could translate into better unit economics versus Waymo. If Waymo is forced to separate from Google as its business continues to gain commercial traction, it risks losing out on its hard-won lead. Alphabet stock has declined by about 10% year-to-date, due to concerns about the economy, doubts about the growth of the company’s search business in the AI era, and the ongoing antitrust issues. See how Alphabet's valuation ratios compare against historical levels and also versus peers.

Title: Elon Musk’s Neuralink Raises $650M in Series E Funding

Our goal is to help families make informed decisions to keep their children safe online. Read more. Key Takeaways Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface startup, has successfully closed its Series E funding round, securing an impressive $650 million. The round attracted a powerhouse roster of investors, including ARK Invest, DFJ Growth, Founders Fund, G42, Human Capital, Lightspeed, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital. The figure represents a significant jump from its Series D funding round in August 2023, which raised $280M and an additional $43M coming in November of the same year. In a company blog post, they announced that it has made ‘significant progress’ in building brain interfaces that help restore independence in paralyzed humans. It listed the five individuals now using Neuralink to control devices, the launch of its global clinical trials, the addition of use cases beyond its original intent, and expanding the number of neurons and brain regions its device interacts with among its achievements since 2023. The company has three human patients with ‘Link’, its brain implant. It allows these paralyzed patients to operate phones and computers using their thoughts, which Neuralink calls ‘Telepathy’. The first two patients, Noland Arbaugh and Alex, are paralyzed by spinal cord injuries. But with Neuralink’s help, they have been able to control computers, with Arbaugh using the implant to control the mouse and keyboard, and Alex being able to play Counter-Strike. Another Neuralink patient is Brad Smith, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Having the implant allowed him to ‘speak’ by controlling the mouse and keyboard to type on a computer screen or choose a reply. The message is then output as audio of his voice cloned by AI from samples before he lost his ability to speak due to ALS. As volunteers who participated in the company’s PRIME Study, the three have used Link for 670 days and employed Telepathy to communicate for over 4.9K hours. Founded in 2016 by Musk and a team of scientists and engineers, Neuralink went mainstream the following year after a report from The Wall Street Journal. It was still unclear what products the company might create back then, but there had already been speculations about developing brain implants to treat brain disorders. By 2019, the company raised $158M, with $100M coming from Musk. During this time, Neuralink revealed that it was developing a device similar to a sewing machine that could implant thin threads into the brain. Plans to conduct human trials were scheduled in 2020, but they only received FDA approval in 2023. Arbaugh became the first human to receive the Link implant the following year. However, Neuralink hasn’t been without controversy. A 2022 report by Fortune revealed the departure of most of its founding team, citing internal tensions and concerns over erratic leadership. The article also raised red flags about the company potentially overstating its technological capabilities. In addition, the company faced a probe from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 over the higher-than-normal deaths in its animal tests. While Neuralink is perhaps the most familiar name in the world of brain implants, other companies also share the same goal as Musk’s. For one, there’s Peter Thiel-backed Blackrock Neurotech, which has already conducted trials on over 30 individuals worldwide. Another notable player is Precision Neuroscience, co-founded in 2021 by Benjamin Rappaport, also a Neuralink co-founder. The company recently secured FDA approval to trial its brain-computer interface, allowing temporary implantation in patients for up to 30 days. Overall, this healthy competition among well-funded companies could bode well for paralyzed patients or those suffering from brain disorders. That said, these implants’ viability and widespread use may still be decades away, after which we may have to contend with their potential ethical issues. As technology continues to evolve—from the return of 'dumbphones' to faster and sleeker computers—seasoned tech journalist, Cedric Solidon, continues to dedicate himself to writing stories that inform, empower, and connect with readers across all levels of digital literacy. Read more With 20 years of professional writing experience, this University of the Philippines Journalism graduate has carved out a niche as a trusted voice in tech media. Whether he's breaking down the latest advancements in cybersecurity or explaining how silicon-carbon batteries can extend your phone’s battery life, his writing remains rooted in clarity, curiosity, and utility. Long before he was writing for Techreport, HP, Citrix, SAP, Globe Telecom, CyberGhost VPN, and ExpressVPN, Cedric's love for technology began at home courtesy of a Nintendo Family Computer and a stack of tech magazines. Growing up, his days were often filled with sessions of Contra, Bomberman, Red Alert 2, and the criminally underrated Crusader: No Regret. But gaming wasn't his only gateway to tech. He devoured every T3, PCMag, and PC Gamer issue he could get his hands on, often reading them cover to cover. It wasn’t long before he explored the early web in IRC chatrooms, online forums, and fledgling tech blogs, soaking in every byte of knowledge from the late '90s and early 2000s internet boom. That fascination with tech didn’t just stick. It evolved into a full-blown calling. After graduating with a degree in Journalism, he began his writing career at the dawn of Web 2.0. What started with small editorial roles and freelance gigs soon grew into a full-fledged career. He has since collaborated with global tech leaders, lending his voice to content that bridges technical expertise with everyday usability. He’s also written annual reports for Globe Telecom and consumer-friendly guides for VPN companies like CyberGhost and ExpressVPN, empowering readers to understand the importance of digital privacy. His versatility spans not just tech journalism but also technical writing. He once worked with a local tech company developing web and mobile apps for logistics firms, crafting documentation and communication materials that brought together user-friendliness with deep technical understanding. That experience sharpened his ability to break down dense, often jargon-heavy material into content that speaks clearly to both developers and decision-makers. At the heart of his work lies a simple belief: technology should feel empowering, not intimidating. Even if the likes of smartphones and AI are now commonplace, he understands that there's still a knowledge gap, especially when it comes to hardware or the real-world benefits of new tools. His writing hopes to help close that gap. Cedric’s writing style reflects that mission. It’s friendly without being fluffy and informative without being overwhelming. Whether writing for seasoned IT professionals or casual readers curious about the latest gadgets, he focuses on how a piece of technology can improve our lives, boost our productivity, or make our work more efficient. That human-first approach makes his content feel more like a conversation than a technical manual. As his writing career progresses, his passion for tech journalism remains as strong as ever. With the growing need for accessible, responsible tech communication, he sees his role not just as a journalist but as a guide who helps readers navigate a digital world that’s often as confusing as it is exciting.

By Anna Tong and Krystal Hu SAN FRANCISCO :Two years after the launch of ChatGPT, return on investment in generative AI has been elusive, but one area stands out: software development. So-called code generation or “code-gen” startups are commanding sky-high valuations as corporate boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive human software engineers.

Loading Cursor, a code generation startup based in San Francisco that can suggest and complete lines of code and write whole sections of code autonomously, raised $900 million at a $10 billion valuation in May from a who’s who list of tech investors, including Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel. Windsurf, a Mountain View-based startup behind the popular AI coding tool Codeium, attracted the attention of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is now in talks to acquire the company for $3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Its tool is known for translating plain English commands into code, sometimes called “vibe coding,” which allows people with no knowledge of computer languages to write software. OpenAI and Windsurf declined to comment on the acquisition.“AI has automated all the repetitive, tedious work,” said Scott Wu, CEO of code gen startup Cognition. “The software engineer’s role has already changed dramatically. It’s not about memorizing esoteric syntax anymore.”Founders of code-gen startups and their investors believe they are in a land grab situation, with a shrinking window to gain a critical mass of users and establish their AI coding tool as the industry standard. But because most are built on AI foundation models developed elsewhere, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek, their costs per query are also growing, and none are yet profitable. They’re also at risk of being disrupted by Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which all announced new code-gen products in May, and Anthropic is also working on one as well, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The rapid growth of these startups is coming despite competing on big tech's home turf. Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, launched in 2021 and considered code-gen’s dominant player, grew to over $500 million in revenue last year, according to a source familiar with the matter. Microsoft declined to comment on GitHub Copilot’s revenue. On Microsoft’s earnings call in April, the company said the product has over 15 million users.LEARN TO CODE?As AI revolutionizes the industry, many jobs - particularly entry-level coding positions that are more basic and involve repetition - may be eliminated. Signalfire, a VC firm that tracks tech hiring, found that new hires with less than a year of experience fell 24 per cent in 2024, a drop it attributes to tasks once assigned to entry-level software engineers are now being fulfilled in part with AI.Google’s CEO also said in April that “well over 30 per cent” of Google’s code is now AI-generated, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year the company had saved “the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years” by using AI.In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a conference that approximately 20 to 30 per cent of their code is now AI-generated. The same month, the company announced layoffs of 6,000 workers globally, with over 40 per cent of those being software developers in Microsoft’s home state, Washington.“We’re focused on creating AI that empowers developers to be more productive, creative, and save time,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “This means some roles will change with the revolution of AI, but human intelligence remains at the center of the software development life cycle.”MOUNTING LOSSESSome “vibe-coding” platforms already boast substantial annualized revenues.Cursor, with just 60 employees, went from zero to $100 million in recurring revenue by January 2025, less than two years since its launch. Windsurf, founded in 2021, launched its code generation product in November 2024 and is already bringing in $50 million in annualized revenue, according to a source familiar with the company. But both startups operate with negative gross margins, meaning they spend more than they make, according to four investor sources familiar with their operations. “The prices people are paying for coding assistants are going to get more expensive,” Quinn Slack, CEO at coding startup Sourcegraph, told Reuters. Both Cursor and Windsurf are led by recent MIT graduates in their twenties, and exemplify the gold rush era of the AI startup scene. “I haven’t seen people working this hard since the first Internet boom,” said Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. What’s less clear is whether the dozen or so code-gen companies will be able to hang on to their customers as big tech moves in. “In many cases, it's less about who's got the best technology - it’s about who is going to make the best use of that technology, and who's going to be able to sell their products better than others,” said Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, whose firm invested in Sourcegraph and Poolside, a software development startup that’s building its own AI foundation model.CUSTOM AI MODELSMost of the AI coding startups currently rely on the Claude AI model from Anthropic, which crossed $3 billion in annualized revenue in May in part due to fees paid by code-gen companies. But some startups are attempting to build their own models. In May, Windsurf announced its first in-house AI models that are optimized for software engineering in a bid to control the user experience. Cursor has also hired a team of researchers to pre-train its own large frontier-level models, which could enable the company to not have to pay foundation model companies so much money, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Startups looking to train their own AI coding models face an uphill battle as it could easily cost millions to buy or rent the computing capacity needed to train a large language model.Replit earlier dropped plans to train its own model. Poolside, which has raised more than $600 million to make a coding-specific model, has announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services and is testing with customers, but hasn’t made any product generally available yet.Another code gen startup Magic Dev, which raised nearly $500 million since 2023, told investors a frontier-level coding model was coming in summer 2024 but hasn’t yet launched a product.

Title: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/is-altcoin-season-over-data/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T10:00:39Z
Full Content:
Following the explosive 2021 Bitcoin and crypto bull run, the expectations of an “altcoin season” have become even more pronounced. This term refers to a period where the prices of altcoins rise rapidly and outperform the Bitcoin price by a large margin. Usually, this happens after the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high, and money is rotated into altcoins. However, this has not been the case this cycle. So what happened to altcoin season? Crypto analyst and expert Michaël van de Poppe took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share with his over 790,000 followers that the altcoin season has yet to begin. This goes against the widespread belief that the altcoin season has already come and gone, and is officially over. According to van de Poppe, the altcoin market is actually still in a bear market, but it is about to end. The analyst’s prediction comes as the Bitcoin price remains above six figures, and yet the altcoin market continues to struggle close to its lows. Despite the abysmal market movement and the massive decline in positive sentiment, the crypto analyst still believes that the best is yet to come. He predicts that the crypto bull market is about to begin, and this would be bigger than ever because the bear market has gone on for so long. Furthermore, he points out that this cycle is different than previous cycles and the next 1-3 years will be different as well. Thus, he predicts many investors will miss it for being impatient. Using the chart above, which was created by crypto analyst TechDev, van de Poppe shows that the altcoin market is at a pivotal point. It shows a period where the Bitcoin price is rising and altcoins have remained flat. However, this has usually turned out to be the calm before the storm, and altcoin season tends to follow. If the analyst is right, then the altcoin season never started, and is still in the future. As Michaël van de Poppe mentioned, this cycle has been quite different from the previous one, and there have been a few reasons for this. The first is the advent of large buys from institutions such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and heavy hitters like BlackRock buying up Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The natural consequence of this is that money is now only staying in Bitcoin rather than rotating out at the top into altcoins like last cycle. Also, a big difference between the current cycle and the 2020-2021 cycle is the availability of free cash. Following the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, governments around the world disbursed billions of dollars to citizens to help them weather the storm, and this ‘free cash’ had inadvertently found its way into the market, triggering a massive altcoin season. Other factors that have been pointed out to have contributed to this are the extreme P2P that emerged with the advent of instant meme coin creations. Thousands of new coins flood the market daily, and this has left liquidity spread thin. Also, broader macroeconomic factors such as Donald Trump’s tariff wars have contributed greatly to keeping market performance muted, and the weaker altcoins have suffered more for it.

Title: Henry Holterman: The Dutch midas strikes €1 billion gold vein in Greece (pics)

Henry Holterman is a numbers man.In this invisible but foundational realm, there is no room for misinterpretations or emotion. Based purely on numbers, the Dutch investor ranks among the most successful dealmakers in Greece over recent decades. From the recent sale of his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank to profitable deals in GEK TERNA and Ellaktor, and the capital gains—both visible and hidden—from his investments in Greece, it’s estimated that he has earned close to €1 billion to date. An impressive figure, but fully justified.Those who know him describe a highly disciplined investor with clear targets and a unique ability to spot undervalued assets, investing without loans or leverage. In every investment move he made in Greece, those who engaged with him confirm he is laser-focused on results, unaffected by emotion or ego—even during the toughest business clashes. It’s just business, with the goal of maximizing profit. If others win along the way, great—but that’s not the goal. Obstacles are seen as opportunities to revise strategy and seek alternative paths to a successful exit—no matter how long it takes. Ellaktor and GEK TERNAHis investment principles are reflected in his every move. In early 2018, amid the shareholder civil war in Ellaktor, Holterman flew to Athens in his private jet, invited by the Kallitsantsis brothers seeking backing for their upcoming proxy battle to oust the existing board of the historic construction group. Though the discussions led nowhere—just like the attempt to acquire Forthnet alongside Odyssey-Athena—a new opportunity had already arisen, leading to a 10%, then 30% stake in GEK TERNA. He eventually exited the group of Mr. George Peristeris with an estimated €200 million in returns. Armed with fresh capital, he entered Ellaktor and, after more than two years of fierce rivalry—first with the Kallitsantsis side, then with the Kaymenakis–Bakou–Exarchos trio—he prevailed, having also forged a strong alliance with the Vardinogiannis group. In Alpha BankNext came the divestment of Ellaktor’s assets, executed with mathematical precision. In 2021, while Greece’s investment-grade rating was still a distant dream, he invested in Alpha Bank. While analysts speculated he might become a banker and increase his stake in the bank, he correctly read the signals and chose to sell—earning over €340 million. He still holds a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, purchased during its public offering for €21 million, now valued at €60 million. A Dutch… DreamHolterman could be seen as the epitome of the “Dutch dream”—a twist on the more familiar “American dream.” Yet, his story is cinematic in nature. Born in 1955, he began as a certified auditor. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the Netherlands’ oldest and largest construction groups, whose investment arm is Reggeborgh. During this time, he met and married Herita, one of two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. Wessels himself came from humble beginnings, working in his father Arend’s carpentry business founded in 1933. In 1968, at 22, he took over the company and turned it into one of Europe’s major construction groups. By 2017, when Wessels passed away, he was the third richest Dutchman, with an estimated fortune of €4 billion. Holterman took over the family business empire that year. Reggeborgh’s PowerFounded in 1990 to manage the Wessels family’s investments, Reggeborgh today holds over 20 companies spanning infrastructure, real estate, energy, medical research, and tech across Europe and the U.S. Among its assets: Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorion, and EVI. The family’s net worth is estimated at €15–20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant equity holdings, most notably a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro, making it the bank’s fifth-largest shareholder behind the Dutch government, MFS Investment Management, Norway’s NBIM, and BlackRock. It previously sold its 17.6% stake in Van Lanschot Kempen to ING. The World Online AffairThose who know Holterman call him a “player”—a label that can mean many things in Greek, but in his case, it’s quite literal: he has a passion for stock market investments. One such investment tested him, but he emerged stronger and richer. Reggeborgh was among the early investors in tech firm World Online, holding a significant stake at its IPO in 2000. But the stock crashed post-IPO, causing massive investor losses. Reggeborgh escaped unharmed, having sold its shares beforehand. The saga had legal implications. The company’s founder, Nina Brink (also known as Nina Storms), claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, alleging it owed her per a private agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was settled out of court. Holterman always maintained that no illegal acts occurred and blamed investor over-expectations for the fallout. Under Holterman, the Wessels family office made other lucrative moves—including in fiber-optic firms Reggefiber and Eurofiber, and the investment bank NIBC—despite regulatory scrutiny. It All Began in CorfuAround this time, Greece entered Holterman’s life—more specifically, Corfu. Neither he nor anyone else could have predicted that Greece would yield €1 billion in capital gains. Roughly 25 years ago, he and his wife Herita bought a vacation home in Kassiopi, a stunning part of northern Corfu. The area is home to luxury villas owned by the Rothschilds, Jörg Rockenhäuser (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other ultra-wealthy investors. It was during this time he met Nikos Dendias, then a well-known lawyer in Corfu—long before entering politics. Dendias’ firm has handled many of Holterman’s affairs in Greece, where he has been remarkably active as an investor. Corfu: His Island LoveHolterman’s bond with Corfu only grew stronger. He bought a dream villa in Kommeno, and nearly every summer enjoys the island’s beauty and refined cuisine. From his villa, he overlooks Gouvia Bay, often crossed by the yacht “Guilty” belonging to the Ioannou family. Holterman himself once owned the 47-meter yacht “Lars”, built by Italy’s Sanlorenzo shipyard. He later put it up for sale for €24 million, eventually selling it for an undisclosed amount. Unlike the sea, it seems land is Holterman’s true love. His properties in Corfu and Athens mirror his investment philosophy: prime real estate with hidden value waiting to be unlocked. A striking example is the historic Corfu Palace Hotel, which he reportedly acquired for €30 million from the Fokas family. Opened in 1962, the hotel had seen both glory and decline, in need of major renovations that were always partial and never complete. Now under Holterman’s ownership, it’s undergoing a full €20 million renovation, aiming to reopen in 2026 as a key player in Corfu’s luxury hospitality scene. More Real Estate MovesTwo years ago, he also bought a neoclassical building two blocks from Corfu Palace with views of Garitsa Bay, 1,000 square meters in total, for over €2 million. Five years ago, he reportedly acquired the famous “Red House” (Antico Rosso) for €8 million. This stunning 17th-century mansion, built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery, once belonged to the Kourkoumelis-Rodostamos family—one of Corfu’s oldest and linked by marriage to the Kapodistrias lineage. Locals say Holterman has truly fallen for Corfu. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, coast guard, police, supported the “Melissa” disability center, EKAV, and other nonprofits, sports clubs, and federations—often via Ellaktor. In 2022, Holterman, his wife, and son were honorarily granted Greek citizenship. What’s Next?Corfu isn’t his only turf. Holterman has also built a significant real estate portfolio in Athens. Real estate insiders say REDS paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., managed by the Holterman family. The Hestia Luxury Apartments brand, part of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. Other properties across Greece remain under his ownership—though not all are publicly known. Explore related questions

Title: I’m Very Glad That New York Has Ranked-Choice Voting

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access I can vote for two candidates—Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander—who’ve made climate a cornerstone of their campaigns, with real hopes that one or the other will prevail. I was lucky enough as a young reporter to find myself covering elections in the only city in America that chose its leaders via ranked-choice voting (RCV). This was… a long time ago, and so it all happened on paper: Cambridge voters listed city councilor candidates, sometimes twenty or more, in order of preference, and then, over the course of a week, teams of older ladies physically distributed the ballots around an elementary school gymnasium. As candidate X with the lowest number of first place votes was disqualified, they would carry his ballots to the piles of the candidate listed second, and so on until only the winner remained. All of this happens by computer now, in a burp. But it remains a splendid system. Usually people defend it on the correct grounds that you can vote for a third-party candidate without losing your vote—should they be eliminated, your ballot will go to your next-favorite choice. But there’s also the benefit that two good but similar candidates—the Bernie/Warren problem—don’t split the progressive vote. I’ve long ago left New York City for the northern mountains, but I continue to follow its politics, in large part because they’re so important to the world. The city’s vast public pension fund, for instance, has been used in recent years to help advance the fight against climate change, more skillfully than most such instruments, and I’d like to see that continue. And New York’s sheer vastness and dynamism means it’s a great place to help lead the fight for change: the current effort, for instance, to refurbish large buildings to make them more efficient is showing the rest of the country what can be done. So I’m very glad that New York has RCV, which means you can vote for two candidates who’ve made climate a cornerstone of their campaigns, with real hopes that one or the other will prevail. Zohran Mamdani, the young progressive who seems to be consolidating left votes, led the fight against a fracked gas power plant in his home turf of Astoria. He didn’t just say the right words—he mobilized an impressive fight to get it done. Brad Lander, meanwhile, the city’s current comptroller, did something of inordinate value last month, standing up to Blackrock, which is essentially the same thing as standing up to capitalism. The financial giant needed to do some very specific things to start addressing the climate crisis, he said, or they would find themselves without New York’s hundreds of billions of dollars—this is at last the blue state equivalent of what red state treasurers have spent the last few years doing, which is intimidating the world’s financial powers. (Here’s the Financial Times >attesting to the global importance of his courage). What I’m saying is, if your interest is the planet, both candidates have things to recommend them. Probably I’d vote Lander 1 and Mamdani 2, because I like kicking Big Money in the nuts more than anything else; maybe, when I walked into the booth, I’d switch those two on the grounds that younger is better. Maybe I’d argue myself out of that on the (somewhat sentimental) grounds that it’s hard to imagine New York without at least one representative of the liberal Jewish political heritage that’s done so much for us all, or on the slightly solider reasoning that New York’s vast bureaucracy might be less intimidating to someone who’s spent more time in it. The point is, New Yorkers have a less excruciating choice than most of us in these situations. They don’t have to pretend they don’t have two excellent candidates (and actually several others). But remember—you don’t have to rank any more candidates than you want to. You also get the pleasure of leaving Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo off your ballot, a satisfying (and electorally useful) dis that too few American voters are privileged to enjoy. The slow spread of RCV is one of the life rings we can toss to try to rescue our drowning national politics. For now, enjoy it, you lucky New Yorkers!

Title: Coinbase delayed revealing data breach that may cost up to $400M, drops third-party vendor

Legal battles loom for Coinbase over delayed breach disclosure and insider hacks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Secret knowledge, sudden split: the crypto exchange faces mounting legal and regulatory heat for a four-month silence over a breach affecting at least 69,000 customers. Coinbase was alerted as early as January 2025 that hackers had siphoned tens of thousands of customer records from one of its overseas support vendors, but the exchange waited until 14 May to notify regulators and users, according to internal emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with three people briefed on the incident. The revelation comes as Coinbase abruptly terminated its relationship with TaskUs, the Texas-based outsourcing firm whose India call centre staff were allegedly bribed to leak screenshots and KYC files. At least 69,461 customers’ names, addresses, partial Social Security numbers, and ticket histories were exposed. Coinbase has warned investors that the breach could cost $180 million to $400 million in remediation and potential claims. Coinbase said it discovered evidence of contractor misconduct, moved quickly to cut access, and is enhancing controls across all third-party vendors. TaskUs confirmed it fired more than 200 employees in Indore after Coinbase raised alarms in January, but it insisted it “immediately escalated” the issue to its client. A TaskUs spokesperson said the company is “cooperating with law enforcement agencies in India and the United States.” Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s new cyber-incident rule, publicly traded companies must file an 8-K within four business days of determining an incident is material. Coinbase’s May filing noted “prior months” of unauthorised activity but did not specify the January alert. Such inaction could be considered to be a textbook case of material non-compliance. The SEC may ask for confirmation as to why the clock didn’t start in January. A securities-fraud class action filed Monday in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleges Coinbase “withheld adverse information” that would have moved its share price. A separate negligence suit targets TaskUs in Manhattan federal court on behalf of affected users. Court filings describe a small criminal ring that paid support agents to photograph Coinbase’s screens with personal identifiers visible. By March, the scheme had widened, with stolen credentials sold on Telegram channels tied to “pig-butchering” crypto scams. On 11 May, the hackers, emboldened by their haul, emailed Coinbase demanding $20 million in exchange for deleting the data. Coinbase refused, instead offering a $20 million bounty for information leading to arrests. TaskUs, founded in 2008 and now valued at around $1.5 billion, counts Meta and DoorDash among its clients. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase have leaned on the firm to provide 24/7 customer support at a lower cost than U.S. hires through its 61,400 full-time staff. Security consultants warn that offshoring sensitive identity documents to low-wage environments creates the perfect storm for insider bribery. Human-layer attacks are increasingly outpacing technical exploits, as buying an underpaid agent is far cheaper than breaking robust encryption. The breach occurs as Coinbase and other crypto stakeholders wage a public campaign for lighter U.S. crypto rules. Rival exchanges Kraken and Gemini, who also use business-process outsourcing shops, will now rush to audit their own vendor controls, according to people familiar with those reviews. Meanwhile, affected Coinbase customers report continued phishing attempts and SIM-swap attacks. The company has offered two years of identity-theft monitoring but has not committed to reimbursing any downstream crypto losses. For Coinbase, the incident threatens balance-sheet costs and its narrative as the most compliant brand in crypto. Trust is the only hard currency an exchange has. Losing it, even for four months, can be fatal. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Title: The mounting anxiety over tech jobs is turning ugly

The social network Blind had real juice when I wrote about it in June 2022. It gave 5 million tech workers a place to anonymously talk smack about their employers. Identified only by their workplaces, Blinders traded office gossip, swapped tips on acing technical interviews at places like Apple and Google, and voluntarily shared their Total Compensation — "TC," in the site's argot. Blind served as a giant, freewheeling water cooler for Silicon Valley. Back then, the tech industry was on the verge of what would be a catastrophic downturn in hiring. But Blinders didn't seem worried. They were too busy trying to figure out how to live like kings. How could they boost their TC to stratospheric levels? What were the secrets to climbing the ranks of a FAANG company, or starting a unicorn? Which employers offered the most lavish perks and the best work-life balance? Here and there, I noticed that a few Blinders were starting to wonder if they should get out of tech before all the jobs disappeared. But the overall vibe was: What's the best way to get ahead and live the good life? Three years later, tech employment is in free fall. Since its peak in late 2022, the industry has shed 175,000 jobs. Artificial intelligence is threatening to make the work of coders obsolete, and companies like Meta and Google are slashing perks, gutting middle management, ordering everyone back to the office, and putting employees on performance improvement plans designed to weed out low performers. Tech's role in our lives has never been more ascendant, but as far as the actual business goes, what seemed like a cyclical downturn back in 2022 has become a full-scale apocalypse. So it seemed like a good time to head back to Blind and see how people are feeling. What are workers in the tech industry saying, in the place where they have no fears about speaking their mind? How are Blinders handling the seismic shift taking place in Silicon Valley? The short answer is: not well. Gone is the single-minded focus on fat salaries and work-life balance. Today the site is suffused with a palpable, sour anxiety. Blinders grouse about being ghosted by job recruiters. They rail against the performance plans being implemented by their employers. Even worse, they accuse one another of lying and cheating. In the old days, Blinders treated each other with respect. The platform felt like something unheard of in the age of Twitter trolling: a true community. But now, not unlike much of the internet, Blind is infused with caustic racism and misogyny. Nobody trusts anyone, and everyone is very tired. Blind used to be a friendly and supportive place for the Lords of Tech to celebrate their ascendancy. Now it's devolved into "Lord of the Flies." Everyone on Blind still hopes they're gonna make it big someday. It just seems less likely now. Many Blinders are out of work and scrambling to find a job. They argue about the value of sites like LeetCode, which offers coding education tailored to FAANG interviews. They worry about spending a year studying for their big Amazon interview and then blowing it. And those who do have a job are either looking for a new one, or fretting about how little they make. "Does anyone here feel like dying because of their low TC?" asked one poster. After four years on the job, they said, their total compensation is stalled at $81,000. "Been feeling this lately," replied a Blinder who works at SoFi. There's often a weird sense of entitlement when Blinders talk about their compensation. Even with an AI earthquake sending shockwaves up and down Silicon Valley, they still make way more than most Americans — and they kvetch about it anyway. The person at SoFi who feels like dying over their measly pay? "I'm not even at $500k yet," they complained. "TC $415k." (For context, median income in America is under $50,000. In computer and information technology, it's around $106,000.) Compensation envy on Blind was common back in 2022. But now, when Blinders share their TC, they're often attacked as liars or trolls. Sometimes people are even accused of inventing entire jobs. "Job market is so fucked right now, all those multi-offer postings are by maga supporters," one Blinder posted, dismissing anyone claiming that they'd received multiple job offers at once as a right-wing propagandist. In the current struggle for survival, trust has effectively evaporated. It's every coder for themself — and if you claim to have a great job or a high TC, you must be making it up. One of the biggest anxieties on Blind right now involves performance improvement plans. Nobody enjoys being watched closely by their boss, but Blinders seem to feel that PIPs are more than just an evaluation tool. Some see them as a form of tyranny — something inept middle managers use to meet metrics for firing people, not a test of pure coding skill. Others see any opposition to PIPs as a betrayal of the grindcore mindset — if you're scared of a PIP, maybe the low performer is you, bro! "I moved from Amazon to Microsoft because the PIP culture at Amazon completely burned me out," one Blinder wrote. "The whole thing really messed with me mentally, and I promised myself I'd never go through something like that again. Fast forward to today and Microsoft is now rolling out PIP." The poster despaired of ever being free of the constant scrutiny. "Do you need to go to a fucking startup or something??" they wrote. The pile-on began. Some accused the Blinder of being a subpar coder who was too inflexible to take criticism. Others then accused those Blinders of being managers who were too insecure to acknowledge that PIPs are destroying the spirit of teamwork that attracted so many workers to the tech industry. It felt like every other social media platform: a toxic stew of mistrust and recrimination. One thing almost everyone seemed to agree on? That morale is especially terrible at Meta right now. "We are all hired mercenaries chasing high TC," one Meta employee lamented. Others complained about grueling hours and what they see as a culture of backstabbing. "I'm at Meta," another Blinder wrote. "God I wish I wasn't. And yes I'm interviewing to make that change happen asap. When I started a year ago I thought, 'Blind suffers from selection bias, etc., it will be just fine and like any big tech company.' Nah dawg. It be bad." The point here isn't whether the Blinders are right. It's that in the wake of massive layoffs, many tech workers have sunk into a deep pit of paranoia, finger-pointing — and worse. Back in 2022, I didn't see much racism and misogyny on the platform. Now it's everywhere. Blind recently boasted that it had 12 million registered users, primarily because of its expansion into South Korea and India. Blinders might be turning up the racism dial in response to the newbies. But it's also true that tech in general is suffering from an outbreak of toxic bro-ism. As a team of sociologists wrote of the tech sector in 2023, "The most striking workplace development in recent years may well be the surfacing of a culture of gloves-off sexism and racism at some firms." The field has long been dominated by young white men; more recently, women and people of color have begun to make gains. A lot of the guys on Blind are quick to blame their woes on DEI. One Blinder — a self-described "Indian American born in the USA" — uncorked a truly vile tirade against "Indian women managers." it ranged from stereotyping about people who are "fresh off the boat" to derogatory speculation about their love lives to outright calling them "overweight and ugly." In another post, a Blinder from Adobe asked a workplace etiquette question. "Co-worker brings Indian food to desk and whole aisle smells like food," they wrote. "How to be respectful and say no to this habit?" A Blinder from Pinterest tried to step in. "I'm going to assume that this question was asked in good faith," they wrote. "But next time rather than pointing out the cuisine specifically, just say that they brought 'ethnic food' to the office and the smell is particularly strong." Their heart was in the right place — or at least near it. But the next exchange obliterated any goodwill: Apple: Bring big fat beef steak , and make sure to eat in front of him loudly … He will stop eating at desk afterwards. Instacart: Stop overreacting you pos. You can eat fish, beef and all the crap that stinks but it's only Indian food that bothers you. Prick. Corum: You are the one overreacting. The OP asked the question respectfully. Indian food is really pungent compared to a ham sandwich. In a sense, 'twas ever thus. Silicon Valley has long struggled with racism and misogyny. As those sociologists wrote, modern tech was founded in part on "an exploitative guest worker program that prioritized entry for East and South Asian engineers starting in the 1960s." But the Blind I remembered didn't indulge in X-style hyperpolarization. Today, the shrapnel explodes in all directions. Men on Blind accuse each other of lying about how much they exercise, and how many women they have sex with. Men who claim to be of Indian descent ask other Indian men how to deal with their white American wives who want to have jobs. Blind's recent growth has also come from more women joining the network — and for them, this nonsense is exhausting. "If you choose a career you are a feminist," a worker from Amazon posted in a channel called Women in Core Tech. "If you don't have a career you are a gold digger. If you have an opinion you are argumentative, if you don't have one you are boring. It's like they were expecting pets and don't know how to deal with an entire other gender of humans." A few men replied sympathetically — sorry you're dealing with this, it sucks, etc. They got called simps. A Googler responded with a chart from the Financial Times showing a global divergence in politics between men (who are growing more conservative) and women (who are growing more liberal). The Googler cited it as evidence that women have taken up "woke moral purity as a substitute for religion." The going has gotten tough in tech. Things are falling apart. Today, the open, communal vibe I encountered on Blind back in 2022 seems like a relic of some long-forgetten age. A spokesperson for the network tells me that, according to their data, the percentage of posts that use discriminatory language has actually decreased slightly since 2022. But the overall volume of posts has grown, so "the absolute number of problematic posts may rise." Whatever the math, I was heartbroken to see that Blind, too, has gone feral. In the boom days of tech, the platform's homepage used to have a running ticker in the upper right corner cycling through a list of current job openings, many of which offered remarkably high levels of compensation. It seemed like both goal and enticement, a mutually agreed-upon brass ring for those who had decided to make a career in tech. Now the ticker, along with many of the jobs it used to list, is gone. For Blinders, all that's left is a dystopian cesspool of snark — most of it directed not at the external forces reshaping their livelihoods, but at one another. For millions of beleaguered, burned-out users, it's one more indignity to bear as they struggle to hang on to what little hope they have left.

Title: Hong Kong leader says sudden removal of China's top official in the city was "normal"

East Asia Zheng Yanxiong, director of China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, speaks during the National Security Education Day opening ceremony in Hong Kong, China on Apr 15, 2024. (File photo: REUTERS/Lam Yik) HONG KONG: Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, said on Tuesday (Jun 3) that China's recent removal of its top representative in the city, known for his hardline policies on national security, had been a "normal" personnel change. In a surprise development, China announced late on Friday that Zheng Yanxiong, the director of China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong - Beijing's main representative office in the city with powerful oversight over local affairs - had been "removed" from his post. He was replaced by Zhou Ji, a senior official with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on the State Council. Zheng, who played a key role in the crackdown on Hong Kong's democratic movement in recent years, was also stripped of his role as China's national security adviser on a committee overseeing national security in Hong Kong.

Loading No explanation by Beijing or Chinese state media was given for the change. According to a person with knowledge of the matter, Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison's proposed sale of its global port network to a consortium initially led by US firm Blackrock had caught senior Chinese leaders "by surprise" as they had not been informed beforehand and Zheng was partly blamed for that. The person, who has spoken with the liaison office, declined to be identified as the discussions were confidential. The Liaison Office gave no immediate response to faxed questions from Reuters. Zheng had served in the post since January 2023 and while the position has no fixed term, his tenure was shorter than predecessors including Luo Huining and Zhang Xiaoming. "The change of the Liaison office director is I believe, as with all changes of officials, very normal," Lee told reporters during a weekly briefing, without being drawn on reasons for the reshuffle. "Director Zheng has spent around 5 years (in Hong Kong). Hong Kong was going through a transition period of chaos to order," Lee said, referring to the months-long pro-democracy protests that erupted across Hong Kong in 2019 while adding that he looked forward to working with Zhou.

CK Hutchison's ports deal has been criticised in Chinese state media as "betraying" China's interests and bowing to US political pressure. The conglomerate, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, agreed in March to sell the majority of its US$22.8 billion global ports business, including assets along the strategically significant Panama Canal, to the consortium. The consortium is now being led by another member – Terminal Investment Limited, which is majority-owned by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company. The deal is still being negotiated. Asked whether Zheng's removal reflected a pivot by Beijing towards economic development from national security, Lee said Hong Kong still needed to pursue both. "Hong Kong faces a stage where development and safety must be addressed at the same time because any development must have a safe environment." China promulgated a powerful national security law in 2020, arresting scores of opposition democrats and activists, shuttering liberal media outlets and civil society groups and punishing free speech with sedition – moves that have drawn international criticism.

Title: Business Insider slashes 21% of workforce amid strategic pivot toward AI

Business Insider is cutting 21 percent of its workforce across all departments as part of a restructuring strategy focused on efficiency and long-term sustainability. CEO Barbara Peng said the company is "going all-in on AI," with tools like generative AI search, an AI-powered paywall and broader automation integrated into operations. BI is narrowing its editorial scope to areas like business, tech and innovation, shutting down most of its e-commerce operations and expanding its BI Live events division. The Insider Union condemned the layoffs, calling them a continuation of Axel Springer's "pivot away from journalism toward greed" and criticized the use of AI as a justification for job cuts. The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years.

The Insider Union condemned the layoffs, calling them a continuation of Axel Springer's "pivot away from journalism toward greed" and criticized the use of AI as a justification for job cuts.

The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years. Business InsiderÂ (BI) is laying off more than one-fifth (21 percent) of its staff as it pivots toward AI-powered content production, streamlined operations and a narrower editorial focus. The cuts, announced by CEO Barbara Peng in a memo to employees on May 29, affect employees across all departments. Peng described the cuts as part of a "leaner, more focused" strategy centered on AI adoption, live events and targeted coverage areas like business, tech and innovation. "We are reducing the size of our organization, a move that will impact about 21 percent of our colleagues and touch every department. This will be a difficult day, and our first priority is to provide clarity and support to those colleagues whose roles are being eliminated," Peng wrote in the memo. Peng indicated in the memo that the media outletÂ will shut down most of its e-commerce operations due to their reliance on search traffic, though a few high-performing verticals will be retained. At the same time, the company plans to expand its BI Live events business â a growing revenue stream that Peng says allows the company to "showcase our journalism, connect directly with our audience and build a strong portfolio of experiences." (Related: Job cuts in mainstream media outlets could lead to AI TAKEOVER of news industry.) Moreover, Peng revealed that BI is "going all-in on AI," citing the rollout of multiple AI-powered tools, including generative AI site search and an AI-driven paywall system. She also teased new AI products on the horizon and suggested that automation will be used across business operations to improve efficiency. Peng also disclosed that BI is narrowing its editorial focus on areas that attract the publication's "most loyal readers," although she did not elaborate on which verticals those are. She noted that 70 percent of the company's business is subject to fluctuations in web traffic and that the organization must be "structured to endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control." The layoffs are effective immediately, with impacted employees receiving direct communication from HR. BI's United Kingdom division is also affected, with a separate downsizing process underway. Insider Union criticizes Business Insider for laying off employees over AI The announcement has drawn strong backlash from the Insider Union, which is affiliated with the NewsGuild of New York. In a scathing statement, the union called the move "another example of Axel Springer's brazen pivot away from journalism toward greed." "We were notified that Business Insider management intends to lay off about 20 percent of our members as part of their ongoing âstrategy' to 'build toward something new,'" the union said. "Let's be clear: This is far from anything new. This is the third round of layoffs in as many years and it is unacceptable that union members and other talented coworkers are again paying the price for the strategic failures of Business Insider's leadership." The union also took sharp aim at the company's AI push, calling Peng's emphasis on automation "tone-deaf" in the context of mass layoffs. "To say this was tone-deaf to include in an email on layoffs would be an understatement," the statement read. "Our position as a union is that no Al tool or technology should or can take the place of human beings." Visit FutureTech.newsÂ for more stories like this.

Title: Executive Incentives Under Common Ownership
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/06/03/executive-incentives-under-common-ownership/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T04:05:52Z
Full Content:
In recent years, legal scholars and economists have debated whether the rise of “common ownership” by large institutional investors dampens competition. The concern is that when asset managers such as the Big Three – BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street – hold stakes in multiple competing companies, they might encourage those firms to compete less aggressively with one another or even collude. One way asset managers might soften competition is through executive compensation: Common owners could restructure executive pay packages at the companies they own to blunt incentives for cut‑throat competition. Common owners might discourage relative performance evaluation (RPE), a popular pay practice that rewards executives for outperforming peers. A typical RPE award pays top managers more, whether in cash or shares, when their firm outperforms rivals on metrics such as return on equity or total shareholder return. RPE therefore aligns pay with competitive success and motivates managers to vie fiercely against competitors. Eliminating or weakening RPE could, in principle, enable tacit collusion and allow commonly owned firms to earn higher profits than they would in a fully competitive market. In a recent paper, I test whether common owners reduce RPE at their portfolio firms and find clear evidence to the contrary. In fact, the Big Three exhibit strong preferences for RPE. I find evidence of this on three levels. First, more common ownership, measured by how many industry peers share institutional owners, does not lead to reduced RPE use. Instead, firms with greater ownership stakes held directly by the Big Three are significantly more likely to adopt RPE. This positive effect persists even when the Big Three own stakes in multiple competing firms, directly contradicting the anti-competitive narrative. Furthermore, the prevalence of RPE increased substantially during my study’s sample period, from under one-third of firms using RPE in 2010 to nearly two-thirds by 2021, precisely as the Big Three’s market influence was growing. Second, I analyze shareholder voting behavior on executive pay (“say-on-pay”) proposals. If common owners sought to reduce competition through executive incentives, they would likely voice support for compensation packages without RPE. Instead, my findings indicate that firms receive greater shareholder support, especially from the Big Three, when their pay packages include explicit RPE measures. Third, I explore whether common ownership affects firms’ choice of performance benchmarks, another subtle avenue to reduce competitive pressures. The results show the opposite: Firms with significant Big Three ownership tend to choose closely competing companies as performance benchmarks, not avoiding but rather enhancing competitive pressure. Combining these findings, the paper’s core message is that common ownership has not led to weaker executive incentives for competition. Across multiple dimensions, including whether a firm adopts RPE, how shareholders vote on pay, and how peer groups are constructed, there is no support for the idea that common owners encourage collusion through CEO pay design. If anything, the influence of the largest common owners (the Big Three) is associated with more performance-based pay and thus potentially more competition among portfolio companies, not less. Why do the Big Three support RPE in executive compensation? One explanation is that, in their stewardship roles, they generally advocate for robust pay-for-performance systems because these incentives align executives’ interests closely with long-term value creation. By linking executive compensation to relative performance, the Big Three can effectively hold executives accountable, ensuring firms strive for superior operational and financial results. Another plausible explanation is reputational: Given heightened regulatory and public scrutiny of their market power and influence, the Big Three may adopt a “blue sky” approach, endorsing transparent, competitive compensation structures like RPE to avoid any perception of collusion or conflicts of interest. By publicly supporting rigorous performance evaluation, these asset managers signal their commitment to fair competition and governance best practices. From a policy perspective, these findings caution against heavy-handed regulatory interventions targeting common ownership, such as mandated divestitures or stringent antitrust constraints. Regulatory actions undertaken without clear evidence of anti-competitive harm could inadvertently disrupt beneficial governance practices, including effective executive incentive structures like RPE. Worse yet, such interventions might ultimately harm the millions of investors who rely on institutional asset managers for financial goals like retirement. Instead, policy should focus on enhancing transparency and accountability among large institutional investors, avoiding blanket restrictions that could unintentionally undermine their positive societal contributions. My paper also makes an important technical contribution: Researchers should not treat institutional investors as a monolith, especially when studying common ownership. Regressing an RPE dummy on aggregate Direct Ownership and aggregate Common Ownership yields positive and statistically significant coefficients on the latter, but this is due to omitted variable bias. Separating these measures into four distinct categories, Big Three Direct Ownership, Big Three Common Ownership, Other Direct Ownership, and Other Common Ownership, reveals the true relationships. Regressing RPE on these four measures produces positive and statistically significant coefficients on Big Three Direct Ownership and small, statistically insignificant coefficients on the remaining three. Thus, researchers must consider the composition of institutional investors to avoid misattributing the effects of large asset managers such as the Big Three to common ownership. My study demonstrates that fears regarding common ownership’s anti-competitive effects are likely overstated. Instead, large institutional investors, particularly the Big Three, play a constructive role in corporate governance by advocating for stronger performance-based executive pay structures that enhance rather than diminish competition. This post comes to us from Professor Thomas Schneider at the University of Oklahoma, Price College of Business. It is based on his recent paper, “Executive Incentives Under Common Ownership,” forthcoming in the Journal of Corporate Finance, special issue on Statistically Non-significant Results in Financial Economics, and available here.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: MNTN is ad tech’s canary in the coal mine for future public listings
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/mntns-ipo-notes-how-complicated-it-is-to-launch-successfully-compared-to-recent-years/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → MNTN’s initial public offering has revived hopes for ad tech companies eyeing public markets, debuting at $16 per share and quickly rising to $28, with a valuation of $1.2 billion. Backed by Morgan Stanley and linked to Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds (albeit tangentially), the company benefits from a high profile. However, how long will it take for the shine to come off, especially in a year when one of its most readily comparable peers on Wall Street has experienced a significant hit on its stock price? The outfit went public on May 22, 2025, pricing its stock at $16 per share, with the price increasing more than 60% from its IPO price since, a performance suggesting that Wall Street favors it. Still, it faces skepticism over past controversies and limited scale, with $225 million in 2024 revenue equating to a $32.9 million net loss.Meanwhile, observers of the space will recall that MNTN — an outfit known initially, after its founding in 2009, as Steelhouse — has been no stranger to criticism. Those interested further need only look up its (now resolved) legal disputes with Criteo as an example. MNTN’s stockholders will be relieved to hear that several equity analysts told Digiday that investors focus on revenue or profitability impacts, not just allegations. However, success demands flawless execution amid macroeconomic uncertainty, and action on said allegations could soon prove a drag on its price. “Fraud allegations are common in the space and usually don’t have a sustained impact on the stock price,” noted one. Mark Zgutowicz, a managing director at The Benchmark Company who analyzes stocks such as Criteo, LiveRamp, and The Trade Desk, noted that ongoing concerns around tariffs and their impact on consumer incomes are “the elephant in the room” for such companies’ stock prices. It is in this context that such companies, as well as MNTN, must continue to show the robust nature of their business. Zgutowicz said The Trade Desk’s Q4 miss was minor and the stock overreacted, and that Benchmark was upgrading it to a neutral position for its earlier sales rating. “With Criteo, I think the expectations were set too high for them, and they’re owning up to that,” he added. “LiveRamp, I think, is managing through the macro[environment] better because their expectations were set more appropriately.” Karsten Weide, founder of W Media Research, noted how ad tech IPOs are tougher now than in the mid-2010s or early 2020s, primarily because the ‘growth at all costs’ era has eroded. “Today, in 2025, Wall Street wants to see profitability and transparency, skeptical of ad tech’s complexity,” he noted. “AI’s impact and competition from giants like Google make it harder for companies like MNTN to succeed and stand out.” “Amazon realizes it has missed the boat on display advertising, so it is concentrating on using Fire TV and Prime Video as a Trojan Horse,” noted one source when commenting on Amazon’s fresh attempts to overhaul its market share in the DSP sector. — An anonymous agency source The winners and losers of Google’s AI Mode The Sellout Erich Wasserman, former MediaMath sales chief, Dominic Joseph, former CEO of Capitfy and Myles Younger, now of U. of Digital discuss their creative pasts with Paul Knegten, formerly the CMO of Beeswax and Outbrain, in a weekly mini-series that debuts on June 4. Google judge mulls softer remedies in US search antitrust case U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard closing arguments on May 30 at a trial on proposals to address Google’s search monopoly, suggesting he is considering making Alphabet’s Google take less aggressive measures to restore competition in online search than the 10-year regime proposed by antitrust enforcers. What’s On The Agenda For Michael Komasinski, Criteo’s New Chief?

Title: Some game developers are trying to justify $80 games

Gaming as a hobby is appearing to get more expensive. With the rise in prices for hardware and other aspects of video games, everyone is going to have to shell out more to engage with their favorite pastime. However, while the price of home game consoles and PC gaming has increased over time, one aspect of video games that's attracting a lot of debate is the price of individual releases. Not that long ago, it felt like $60 would be enough to buy most new releases that would come out at retail. But now it seems some developers are aiming to reach an $80 price point for their newest releases. And most players are not happy about it. Much of this has to do with the changing economic times of the world, but most of what affects video games comes from within the industry itself. And as people struggle with the reality of games costing more, some developers are trying to be as honest as possible about why their games will garner a higher price tag. Change is coming in a very real way, and it's going to affect how everyone engages with video games as a hobby. But what are the legitimate reasons why games will cost more money? Here's how developers are trying to justify why games costing $80 moving forward are the right move for everyone. Nintendo making Mario Kart World cost $80 received a ton of backlash, but they can justify it if the game has enough content now and in the future Making a video game and releasing it to the public costs a lot of money. Most AAA game releases that we see on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will cost millions of dollars to put together and be ready for release on specific platforms. But when you add the necessity of getting the attention of potential customers, the numbers get even higher. So before you know it, one game could have a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, all before anybody knows whether it will be a success. But what's scarier is that the overall cost of all this is getting even higher than before, affecting nearly every game developer. This is why new games like Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2 are going to cost $80 on release. A lot of effects of the increasing cost of making games are being seen in the frequent layoffs and turnover within the gaming industry itself. Some companies just don't have the resources to sustain groups of people during or after the completion of a project, and in some of the worst cases, cancellations. One way to help offset this is to have games cost more at retail, putting much of the burden on customers to help solve the problem. In theory, this could work, but there are many factors that could affect why this may or may not be the best course of action. Regardless, this is where many in the industry are leaning. Releasing a game doesn't just mean doing so within the country it's developed in anymore. The majority of games that are made end up having releases in multiple regions, sometimes a simultaneous worldwide release for bigger games. This can help reach more players/customers in other territories and hopefully increase the revenue generated, but one small problem has been growing recently. Changes in policy between countries, such as the amount of money used to pay tariffs on goods. This affects many companies, especially bigger game companies that make consoles, and forces them to find solutions to compensate for the extra billing. Many have pointed to the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been reported to have some issues stemming from the incoming tariffs in the United States. Microsoft recently increased the prices of all its Xbox hardware releases, as well as the prices of games for its Xbox consoles. While the company did not explicitly say tariffs were the reason, many believe it to be because other companies are taking similar actions with their own products. Reports online cited Amazon's Jeff Bezos when he discussed showing the cost of tariffs on certain items sold through Amazon in North America. If it costs more to release products in different parts of the world, that money will come from somewhere, which will most likely be from the customers making the purchase. Microsoft joins in on increasing prices for hardware and software. Get ready to pay more... There's another aspect of this that has been in practice already for some time. Games that have come out at the $60 price point have not always contained the full amount of content developed for them, with publishers opting to have season passes with additional downloadable content available. These expansions end up boosting the price of new releases above the $60 price tag and sometimes into the $100 range to get the full experience and complete amount of content. Instead of having a partial $60 release, the option of having an $80 or more version with everything in there seems like a premium deal. This practice has grown in recent years because studios are trying to find ways around the rising cost of development. And while some studios with big releases have been able to make this work, others have not found the same level of success, but rather harsh criticism from players. Most gamers who are eagerly awaiting Grand Theft Auto VI are going to be open to paying $80 or more for the game, mostly due to the notoriety of the series and anticipation of the new release. However, not every studio has a brand or name that garners that same level of power from players, yet more companies will see this happen and use the same tactics. To some, it comes off more as locking away content that could otherwise be added to the standard release, for the sake of profit. Although it's a smart business move that any studio would find viable, it affects the trust of players who would buy games. Whether everyone wants to admit it or not, change is coming to how we buy video games. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the rising cost of games in stores or digital storefronts, especially when the price of releasing video games to the public continues to go up. Studios are going to continue to find alternatives to how they can balance out the cost and profit of game releases, even if the emotional reaction from players is not always favorable. As sad as it might make us all, change is coming to the price of games, and we're all going to have to deal with it. The Nintendo Switch 2 is almost here. But is it less than what it really needed to be for everyone? We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved Yes, all of these motivations for rising prices are correct, but the market is also much larger than it was a decade or two ago, so the development cost should be split between more customers. The bottom line is most big publishers are making bigger profits than ever before. They're not running out of money. Another angle is what the market will bear. Most people already wait for Ubisoft games to go on sale for $30, for instance, that's not going to change if the MSRP goes up and median income doesn't. Here are the ten games that define the NES. Before steam, there was MS-DOS, which ran a bevy of "new-age" games. These games would go on to become some of the most important in the medium. Here are some SNES games that will likely never come to Nintendo Switch Online. WSL was my gateway to jumping into Linux with both feet. Do you really want to sacrifice performance for aesthetics?

June 02, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) Class Period: May 9, 2024 - May 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 14, 2025 According to the complaint, throughout the class period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Iovance's growth potential; notably, that it was not equipped to generate and drive demand or was otherwise ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported existing demand for its treatments through its network of approved treatment centers. On July 25, 2024, Iovance announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reduced its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. The Company attributed its results and lowered guidance on 1) "the iCTC completed annual scheduled maintenance in December" and "capacity was reduced by more than half for about 1 month," 2) "[l]ower Proleukin sales" than the company expected, and 3) "the variable pace at which ATCs began treatment patients." Following this news, the price of Iovance's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $3.17 per share on May 8, 2025, Iovance's stock price fell to $1.75 per share on May 9, 2025, a decline of about 44.795% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Microsoft and CrowdStrike collaborate on shared threat actor mapping system

Time Published: 2025-06-02T22:37:01Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 18:37 EDT / JUNE 02 2025 by Duncan Riley CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Microsoft Corp. today announced a strategic collaboration aimed at resolving the longstanding confusion in how cyberthreat actors are identified and tracked across security platforms. The partnership establishes a shared mapping system that aligns adversary attribution across both companies’ threat intelligence ecosystems, eliminating ambiguity caused by inconsistent naming. The problem that both companies are trying to solve is one encountered commonly in cybersecurity news: various companies applying their own name to threat actors, making it sometimes difficult for observers to know what threat actor and ransomware group one report to another is talking about. For example, the well-known Cozy Bear hacking group is also known as Midnight Blizzard, depending on which company is writing the report, which doesn’t exactly make intelligence tracking easy when different names are used. To their credit, CrowdStrike and Microsoft can see the problem and have developed a “Rosetta Stone” for cyber threat intelligence, one that links adversary identifiers across vendor ecosystems without mandating a single naming standard. The idea is that by reducing ambiguity in how adversaries are labeled, the mapping enables defenders to make faster, more confident decisions, correlate threat intelligence across sources and better disrupt threat actor activity before it causes harm. “This is a watershed moment for cybersecurity. Adversaries hide behind both technology and the confusion created by inconsistent naming,” Adam Meyers, head of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, said in a media release. “As defenders, it’s our job to stay ahead and to give security teams clarity on who is targeting them and how to respond.” The collaboration will start with a shared analyst-led effort to harmonize adversary naming between CrowdStrike and Microsoft’s threat research teams. Although only announced today, the companies have already “deconflicted” more than 80 adversaries, including validating threat actors like Microsoft’s Volt Typhoon and CrowdStrike’s VANGUARD PANDA are allegedly Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and that Secret Blizzard and VENOMOUS BEAR refer to the same Russia-nexus adversary. Moving forward, CrowdStrike and Microsoft plan to continue working together to expand this effort, inviting other partners to contribute to and maintain a shared threat actor mapping resource for the global cybersecurity community. “Cybersecurity is a defining challenge of our time, especially in today’s AI-driven era,” said Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security. “Microsoft and CrowdStrike are in ideal positions to help our customers and the wider defender community accelerate the benefits of actionable threat intelligence. Security is a team sport and when defenders can share and react to information faster it makes a difference in how we protect the world.” THANK YOU Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 8 MINS AGO Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters INFRA - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 23 MINS AGO Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform CLOUD - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 HOUR AGO

Major U.S. equity indices edged higher as June trading kicked off. The modest gains came despite reheating trade tensions between the world's largest economies as Chinese trade officials rejected President Donald Trump's claims that the Asian nation had violated a trade agreement announced last month. After wavering for much of Monday's session, the S&P 500 rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of 0.4%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%, while the Dow eked out an uptick of 0.1%. Shares of several U.S. steelmakers surged after President Trump announced a plan that would double steel tariffs to 50%. The president said the higher duties on steel imports would protect U.S. workers in the industry and encourage more companies to source the material from U.S. steelmakers. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares soared 10.3%, marking Monday's top performance in the S&P 500, while Nucor (NUE) shares surged 10.1%. Gold futures prices jumped more than 2% on Monday, boosted by heightening geopolitical tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. The uptick in the price of the precious metal helped lift gold-related stocks, including shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, which added 5.4% on Monday. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META) intends to launch a service by the end of next year that will allow advertisers to create and target campaigns entirely through artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Meta shares gained 3.6%. Renewable energy stocks remained under pressure following last week's announcement that the Department of Energy would terminate more than $3.7 billion in grants for clean energy and climate-related projects. The funding cuts exacerbated concerns about the proposed elimination of some renewable energy incentives under the House's reconciliation bill. First Solar (FSLR) stock tumbled 5.3%, declining the most of any S&P 500 stock on Monday. Shares of defense technology specialist Leidos Holdings (LDOS) dropped 4.6%. Last week, Leidos announced that it had acquired Kudu Dynamics, a firm known for developing offensive cyber capabilities enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), in line with a new company strategy that pegs cyber as a key growth area. However, Baird analysts downgraded Leidos stock last week to "neutral" from "outperform," citing a challenging booking environment and an uncertain outlook for government contracting. Shares of U.S. automakers lost ground following Trump's comments on steel tariffs. Higher import taxes threaten to raise vehicle manufacturing costs. Both General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) saw their share prices drop 3.9%, while shares of Chrysler and Jeep parent Stellantis (STLA) lost 3.6%.

Title: The Trump administration is delaying a 25% tariff on Chinese-made graphics cards

Time Published: 2025-06-02T21:14:00Z

Graphics cards and motherboards assembled in China are avoiding President Donald Trump’s import taxes, for now. In a three-page notice published Saturday in the Federal Register, the Office of the Trade Representative said it was “appropriate” to extend a moratorium that won’t subject vendors of electronics equipment to tariffs on graphics cards and graphics processing units. The measure stems from a long-running Section 301 investigation into Chinese economic policies and whether they are harming American companies. That federal probe started under the first Trump administration, and it would apply a 25% tariff if officials conclude that Chinese companies had an unfair advantage. The 25% tariff has been inactive due to a string of reprieves from both the Biden and Trump administrations. China remains the world’s largest electronics manufacturer, according to the International Trade Centre; the nation is still subject to a minimum 30% import tax by the Trump administration, barring some exemptions. Major tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) were spared the brunt of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs in April. A federal court battle is now brewing over the fate of those tariffs. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Both Applied Digital and CoreWeave are backed by Nvidia (NVDA), the second-most valuable company in the world and the chipmaking giant most associated with the rise of artificial intelligence. Nvidia held roughly 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital and 24.2 million shares of CoreWeave as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing. CoreWeave provides its clients with access to data centers, which are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company’s data centers are equipped with Nvidia chips. Shares of CoreWeave rose about 8% on Monday.

Update font size. Reset A new analysis from The Wall Street Journal revealed which CEOs heading up S&P 500 companies had the biggest pay packages in 2024. Apple CEO Tim Cook place 4th on the list. Aislinn Murphy for FOX Business: ‎ The Journal said its analysis looked at MyLogIQ data to rank a total of more than 400 CEOs who had been at the helm of S&P 500 companies for a year or longer. 1. Rick Smith – Axon Enterprises: Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s $164.53 million pay package was the only one of the S&P 500 companies last year in which the package was six figures, according to The Journal. Stock awards linked to company performance accounted for the bulk of his 2024 compensation. Axon, which makes Tasers and other products, had a market capitalization of over $58 billion as of Monday. 2. Lawrence Culp Jr. – GE Aerospace: Larry Culp is the CEO of GE Aerospace. The analysis pegged his 2024 compensation at $88.95 million, earning him the No. 2 spot. 3. Stephen Schwarzman – Blackstone: Blackstone compensated CEO Stephen Schwarzman about $84.03 million in 2024, The Journal reported. The private equity firm had nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management as of the end of March. He co-founded Blackstone in the 1980s along with Peter Peterson. 4. Tim Cook – Apple: Apple CEO Tim Cook’s $74.61 million pay package included cash, equity, and other compensation, according to the Journal. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Can’t see what’s coming except for fat checks and endless stock awards. $74.61 million. While Cook is hemming and hawing when faced with shareholders (virtually, of course, never again in person for as long as Cook remains), Apple is currently in scramble mode trying to catch up to rivals — including the world’s most valuable company, Microsoft — in generative AI, a technology the company seems to have completely missed while focusing instead on the not-ready-for-primetime Apple Vision Pro, visionOS, its now-canceled decade-long multi-billion-dollar electric vehicle boondoggle, replacing leather in iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands with overpriced junk in a quest to “save the planet,” forcing employees to endure a constant barrage of time-wasting zero-productivity DEI sessions, and myriad other various and sundry “initiatives” which Cook deems of import. – MacDailyNews, February 28, 2024 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Disney Layoffs Hit TV Development & Casting Executive Ranks

By Nellie Andreeva Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV Names of Disney TV executives impacted by today’s sweeping layoffs are starting to emerge. As Deadline reported exclusively today, several hundred employees are being laid off globally, with Disney Entertainment’s film and television marketing as well as television publicity, casting and development, as main targets. According to sources, among those leaving is Eric Souliere, VP Casting for 20th Television, who had been working on Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story and 9-1-1 series. He is not going far, though, as the former casting director will be transitioning to casting on the new spinoff, 9-1-1: Nashville, I hear. Also said to be departing is Tony Tompson, VP Content Development at Hulu Originals, who had been at the streamer for more than six years. He already is pursuing new opportunities and has been meeting for jobs. Lower-level development executives, including a manager of drama programming, ABC Hulu, also have been affected. Watch on Deadline There has been some confusion today as several Disney TV executives are leaving or have just left though their exits are not part of today’s layoffs.

Title: Meta Shareholders Vote To Shut Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal in Near-Unanimous Decision

Shareholders at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have decided to shoot down a proposed Bitcoin (BTC) treasury for the tech giant. According to an 8-K Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week, the vast majority of Meta shareholders voted against a BTC treasury proposal as a hedge against inflation. “On May 28, 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) held its annual meeting of shareholders via live audio webcast… At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted on fourteen proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025… At the beginning of the Annual Meeting, there were 1,769,720,699 shares of Class A common stock and 342,865,499 shares of Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which represented 92.61% of the combined voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (voting together as a single class), and which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business.” According to the filing, 3.9 million shares voted for the proposed treasury, while 4.9 billion shares voted it down. Since founder Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 60% of the shares, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuckerberg voted against the measure. Despite the BTC Treasury vote, Meta is still reportedly eyeing a venture into stablecoins amid growing interest and demand for digital assets.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Staged a Blistering May Rally. What's Next?

The Magnificent Seven had a strong May, but the group remains in the red for 2025. What's next? Taken together, the seven big tech stocks—names like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) and more—outperformed dozens of other assets tracked by Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen last month. The group saw their stocks rise more than 13% in aggregate in May, their biggest monthly gain in 2 years, according to Allen. Nonetheless, the group remains one of the few corners of global markets lower since the start of the year. Of 32 different sets of investments tracked by Allen—including global equity indexes, government and corporate bonds, foreign exchange indexes, and commodities—only one other asset, crude oil, is negative for the year. Whether the Mag Seven can climb into positive territory this month could depend on what Wall Street thinks of a few upcoming corporate events. Apple (AAPL) will host its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil a software development kit that helps outside developers build features with Apple Intelligence’s underlying large language models. That would effectively let Apple outsource some of the work of building AI products for its devices, which could help close the perceived gap in AI capabilities between it and major peers. And around the middle of the month, Tesla (TSLA) is expected to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in what could be a major test of the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. Apple and Tesla are the worst-performing stocks in the Mag Seven so far this year, with their shares down about 20% and 16%, respectively. Investor enthusiasm about the companies' progress in some emerging areas seen as vital could help lift their shares. Bank of America analysts on Monday upgraded the information technology sector—home to Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO), the latter a non-Magnificent stock—to neutral from underweight, and downgraded communications services—including Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta—to underweight from neutral. They cited active funds’ historically low exposure to IT and high exposure to communications, as well as the communications and media industry’s comparatively unpredictable revenue streams. Perceived recession risks have decreased in the last month thanks to easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Lately, though each side has accused the other in recent days of violating the terms of their agreement, demonstrating the fragility of their detente. The Mag Seven’s communications companies, Alphabet and Meta, likely have the most recession-proof ad businesses on the internet thanks to the sheer size of their audiences. Yet the tech giants face another risk, according to BofA analysts: Tech companies, they say, addressed elevated interest rates in 2023 by effectively “shortening duration”—they cut costs, reduced capital expenditures, and increased their cash returns. Today, Alphabet and Meta are locked in an all-out AI arms race, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure. That spending could tie the companies’ hands in the event of a slowdown. Another risk for tech stocks is their price tag, according to BofA. Valuations have declined from their recent highs, but the stocks are still expensive—the Mag Seven's P/E ratio of 33.1 is well above the S&P 500's long-term average—and earnings expectations remain elevated.

Title: Circle Going Public On June 4: What Future For The CRCL?

ByMarie Poteriaieva ByMarie Poteriaieva, Contributor. Representation of cryptocurrency and Circle logo displayed on a screen in the background are seen in ... More this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on June 10, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) One of the most anticipated events in crypto business this year is set for Wednesday. Circle, the company behind USDC—the world’s second-largest stablecoin—is going public on the New York Stock Exchange. It will offer 32 million Class A shares at a range of $27-28 under the ticker CRCL, aiming for a $7.2 billion valuation. Circle may seem like an easy bet: issue stablecoins, invest the reserves in Treasuries, and earn risk-free yield while users essentially lend their dollars interest-free. But behind this seemingly simple model lies a more complex and vulnerable business. The future of interest rates remains uncertain, margins are split, and partnerships are costly. In a winner-takes-most market, Circle must outpace the impact of potentially falling rates by capturing a larger share of the stablecoin market—or simply by growing with it. Additionally, the firm’s long-term success may also depend on its ability to diversify and build synergy across its products. Stablecoins have quietly become the backbone of crypto markets—and are increasingly relevant for traditional finance. In 2024, stablecoin transaction volume reached $27.6 trillion, overtaking the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard by almost 8%. The total stablecoin market cap now stands at $248 billion. Circle’s USDC holds a 25% share—second only to Tether’s USDT at 61%—and accounts for $60 billion of the total. Circle’s EURC leads among euro-backed stablecoins with a $224 million market cap. USD-pegged stablecoin supply. Source: DefiLlama Where Circle stands out is in regulatory compliance. In the U.S., USDC has positioned itself as a compliant bridge between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance. In the EU, the implementation of MiCA—and the resulting delisting of non-compliant stablecoins like USDT from major regulated exchanges—has paved the way for USDC to become the region’s leading stablecoin. Citi’s recent report estimates that the stablecoin market could reach a size of $1.6 trillion by 2030 in its base case. Circle, with its compliance-first approach, is well positioned to benefit. Circle’s main revenue stream — 99% of it — comes from investing stablecoin reserves, primarily in short-term U.S. Treasuries. In 2024, this model proved highly lucrative, generating roughly $1.6 billion in interest income. However, that reliance also exposes a risk of over-dependence on interest rates. As Todd H. Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University, wrote in the Financial Times, Another concern is distribution cost. Of Circle’s $1.6 billion revenue, over $1 billion went to “distribution, transaction, and other costs,” according to the company’s S-1 filing. The bulk of that went to Coinbase—Circle’s former USDC co-manager and now a key partner. Circle consolidated statements of operations, Circle S-1 filing. Source: SEC After dissolving the Centre Consortium in 2023, Circle took full control of USDC in exchange for a new revenue-sharing agreement. Under this deal, Coinbase receives 50% of the residual yield from USDC reserves and 100% of the interest generated by USDC balances held on its platform. In return, Coinbase pledged to “support USDC” and “help drive long-term success of the stablecoin ecosystem.” As per Coinbase’s 2024 report, the agreement runs for an initial term of three years. After that, Coinbase and Circle will “discuss in good faith whether any modifications to the Circle Agreement are warranted.” If no new terms are agreed upon, the deal automatically renews for another three years—unless either side fails to meet its obligations. With most of its revenue linked to interest rates and a significant share going to Coinbase, Circle’s long-term prospects could increasingly depend on its ability to diversify. And the diversification effort seems to be underway. Beyond USDC and EURC stablecoins, Circle offers: While revenues from CPN and USYC weren’t included in the S-1 (both too recent), they could effectively diversify Circle’s revenue streams. The CPN in particular could evolve into a blockchain-native alternative to SWIFT—one that’s programmable, compliance-aware, and built for 24/7 financial infrastructure. It’s a compelling bet in a payments market estimated at around $2 trillion annually, as per BCG. USYC, meanwhile, enters the booming market of yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. Assets in such products surged 490% in 2024—from $1.4 billion to $8.25 billion—and now approach $10 billion, according to Stablewatch. In the segment led by BlackRock-backed Ethena’s sUSDe and Sky’s (formerly MakerDAO) sUSDS and sDAI, USYC is still a minor player, holding 4% of the market. Yield-bearing stablecoins (market cap over $40M). Source: Stablewatch Investors appear to think so. According to Bloomberg, Circle’s IPO was already significantly oversubscribed by May 28. Today, the company responded by increasing its valuation target from previously announced $5.65 billion to $7.2 billion. The investors might be onto something. Stablecoins are becoming the de facto digital dollars—especially in a U.S. environment increasingly hostile to CBDCs. Their addressable market spans global remittances, institutional payments, and DeFi integrations. The infrastructure and regulatory positioning that Circle has built could give it a head start, even as traditional giants like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi intend to conceive their own stablecoin. As Benjamin Billarant, founder of Balthazar Capital—an asset management firm with strong exposure to crypto-related equities—commented, Indeed, the bipartisan GENIUS Act—America’s most comprehensive stablecoin bill yet—passed the Senate on May 21 and now heads to the House. Following the vote, President Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks said that the GENIUS Act will "pass with significant bipartisan support." The timing couldn’t be better for Circle’s IPO indeed. All in all, Circle isn’t just a bet on interest rates—it’s a bet on the future of regulated crypto finance. With stablecoin adoption growing and a compliance-first model, Circle could become a key pillar of tomorrow’s payment system. For $CRCL holders, the challenge will be navigating the gradual shift from "easy" rate-driven gains to a more demanding reliance on product-driven revenue. Whether Circle can evolve in time is the question the IPO asks—and the market will soon answer.

Tuesday, 03 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading U.S. investment company BlackRock Inc. is ramping up plans to offer more of its private-market products to individuals outside the United States as the Wall Street giant increasingly tries to muscle in on one of the hottest areas in global finance, reported Bloomberg News on Monday. "The world's largest asset manager is targeting a hiring drive and tie-ups with digital investment platforms in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region to boost individual investors' access to its private-markets products," BlackRock executive Fabio Osta was quoted as saying. "We'll continue expanding," said Osta, head of BlackRock's alternative-specialists team for its EMEA wealth unit, declining to specify recruiting targets. "We want more people in private markets." "BlackRock, a pioneer in providing low-cost stock and bond funds, is betting it can conquer a more opaque and exclusive part of finance by homing in on private markets, where longtime leveraged-buyout titans such as Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. traditionally dominate," the report noted.

President Trump is going to remain focused on structural changes to the global economic system of trade, manufacturing and USA commerce despite all of the grandiose efforts of the multinationals and their Lawfare foot soldiers.As Lutnick again repeats, there are a variety of legal mechanisms that can be used to enforce the tariff program triggered by President Trump. Adhering to them is not optional for trade partners who wish to have access to the USA market. If the exporting nation wants to play games, try and delay or delay tactics, the end result will be even more against their interests. There is no alternative other than to acquiesce.

Circle eyes $896 million from updated IPO as institutional giants like BlackRock join the fray. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has revised its IPO filing to reflect stronger-than-expected investor demand, according to a June 2 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The updated filing shows Circle now plans to issue 32 million Class A shares, up from the previously announced 24 million. It also raised its proposed price range to between $27 and $28 per share, compared to the initial $24 to $26 range. If the final pricing lands at the top end, Circle could raise up to $896 million, which is roughly 44% more than the original estimate of $624 million. This adjustment would also push the company’s valuation to approximately $7.2 billion on a fully diluted basis, up from the earlier $6 billion target. The offering marks a key milestone for the company as it looks to strengthen its standing in the digital finance landscape. USDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, is the second-largest dollar-pegged token globally, with a market cap exceeding $61 billion. Circle’s decision to expand the IPO comes amid rising institutional interest in stablecoins and growing regulatory clarity. Market analysts say the stablecoin sector, long considered a niche industry, is entering a new phase of mainstream relevance due to its rising adoption and trust beyond the crypto-native crowd. As a result, legacy financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and others are warming up to stablecoins by exploring a jointly issued dollar-backed asset. Another substantial evidence of institutional interest in stablecoins is that BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is one of the largest potential buyers of Circle’s stock. Sources familiar with the matter say BlackRock intends to purchase roughly 10% of the IPO shares. If that plan materializes, it would further deepen the relationship between the two firms. BlackRock already plays a key role in managing Circle’s USDC reserves through the Circle Reserve Fund, which holds about 90% of the stablecoin’s backing assets. However, a stake in Circle would expose the asset manager to the broader stablecoin market and expand its interest in the crypto scene beyond ETFs. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: How to uplift Canadian game makers? We asked them

Over a year ago, I wrote a column titled “The Canadian video game industry deserves more recognition.” Despite being a relatively small country, Canada has a multi-billion-dollar gaming sector that’s among the biggest in the entire world, responsible for such globally beloved giants as Mass Effect, Dead by Daylight and Warframe, and indie darlings like Cuphead, Balatro and 1000xResist. And yet, few people seem to know about any of that. Much in the same way that Toronto’s Matt Johnson, the co-writer and director of 2023’s fantastic BlackBerry film, has talked about Canada getting little credit “on the world stage” for effectively inventing the smartphone, our national game creators don’t get much recognition for their significant contributions to pop culture. This was the impetus for my January 2024 column, although I wasn’t expecting it to strike such a chord. Before long, I had received hundreds of likes, comments and messages across social media, especially LinkedIn, with many Canadian game makers echoing my sentiment. Clearly, there was more to explore here. And explore that I did. Over the course of the past year and change, I’ve asked dozens of Canadian developers, actors, lobbyists and the like about how we can address this lack of recognition for our massive gaming industry. Some, admittedly, didn’t really have an answer, and that’s completely understandable. Others, meanwhile, presented all kinds of solutions, offering a great starting point for deeper conversations. And throughout all of this, U.S. government started launching vile and unwarranted attacks against Canadian sovereignty, which has only made these conversations about better supporting each other all the more important. In other words, how can we help Canada’s massive gaming industry get the recognition and support it deserves? Jayson Hilchie (former president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association of Canada): We need people to understand how big the video game industry is in Canada that have nothing to do with the video game industry. When you live in a town and you have General Motors, or you have Ford and someone works there — when you say, “I work at Ford,” everybody knows what that means. But even to this day, with [about 34,000 people contributing $5.1 billion] to the Canadian economy, when you tell someone you work in the video game industry, they always still go, “Oh, really? That’s interesting.” But they don’t know what that means. For me, at least, how do we get working in the video game industry to be almost normalized and respected in a way where people are either not surprised or curious? It’d be great if we got to a spot where you could say, “Yeah, I work at Ubisoft, I work on Assassin’s Creed.” And people go, “Cool! And they know what that is.” But we’re not there. And it is still surprising to me, given how many people work in the industry, and also how ubiquitous video games have become, that we still have those types of responses. And I really think that until we get to that point [of] the average person understanding the impact of the industry that we’re going to have a depreciated level of respect across the country. Paul Fogolin (current president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association of Canada): I’ve worked really hard over the last five or six years to help promote [the industry] to government officials [as the ESAC’s former vice president of policy and government affairs], but there’s just more work to do. It’s not just the MPs in Ottawa, it’s MPPs and MLAs across the country. It’s even councillors and mayors. The City of Toronto actually formed an esports working group, and we were invited to be a part of it, and I’d like to see more of those sorts of things. Interactive Ontario was there. We were there. The tourism people, the esports [people], academics [were there]. So we could do more to speak to player audiences and more to decision makers. The more that we get out there and we tell our story, the more people will start to realize. Remy Siu (founder of Vancouver’s Sunset Visitor, creative director of 1000xResist): I think maybe it’s time for the broader public and media in Canada to realize that Canadian indie games are one of the biggest cultural exports in the country, in the sense of new IP. People around the world may not know Canadian TV shows, for example, but I’m pretty sure they’ve played a Canadian indie game before. Have they played Celeste? Inscryption? Balatro? There’s always talk of how it’s a struggle (and it is) to get Canadian content made and distributed, but indie games are making Canadian content and being distributed to a wide global audience, and also being celebrated on the international stage for their work. Perhaps it’s time to look at these Canadian-made homegrown indie games, with the same sense of some beloved Canadian literature and content, and find a way to catalogue and celebrate them into the future. Vancouver-based Sunset Visitor’s 1000xResist won numerous awards last year, including a prestigious Peabody. (Image credit: Sunset Visitor) Navid Khavari (Ubisoft Toronto narrative director, Star Wars Outlaws): We have a wonderful team — a lot of the [Outlaws] story team is based in Ubisoft Toronto, and we’ve been developing this with our partners at [lead developer] Massive [Entertainment] in Sweden for years. We have a lot of great animators as well within [Toronto] studio, and folks from Ubisoft Montreal that have been contributing. All of the cinematics that we’ve shot have been in studios within Ubisoft Toronto and Ubisoft Montreal. So there’s absolutely just a huge wellspring of talent from Canada that’s been contributing to the game and giving some of that Canadian spirit and flavour, I think, to it. And it’s a beautiful thing with Ubisoft as well that we’re able to do that — that we’re able to work together across an entire ocean and it still feels cohesive. And I think it’s to the studio’s credit, to the talent we have across Canada, to be honest, that I think we’re able to hit the quality of bringing a Star Wars open-world game to life. Marc-Alexis Côté (Ubisoft’s vice president and executive producer of the Assassin’s Creed franchise): I think we should be proud of what we can accomplish in Canada. It’s one of the things I was telling the team recently. We have a talent to be able to build those games that’s very rare in the world — to be able to work together in such a way. There’s over 500 people in Quebec City who worked on [Assassin’s Creed Shadows]. We’ve got people in Montreal. We’ve got a few people in Toronto as well. But it’s like one big family coming together to be able to build those games. And I think it’s exciting. And I think it’s something we should promote more: our craft. Because we are very creative people, and I think we should be proud of that as a country and not hesitate to show it to the world. I think we should promote video games as art more globally — not just within Canada, but like globally. And be proud of it. When you look at the games that we build now, the investment, the talent, the passion that it requires, I can only hope that one day, video games are recognized with the same exposure as movies or music. But I think with the younger generations, for them, gaming is an extension of their life, so I think it’s going to take more and more players, and we just need to keep showing to the world the beautiful games that we can create. And I think our games need to speak for themselves more than us speak about our games in a way. So the more fun they will be, the more people they will draw in, and the more naturally people will look at us to see what the next big thing is. Carl-Edwin Michel (creator of the Canadian Game Awards): This community needs to be celebrated. It’s just an unfortunate situation. [Canada is] the third largest creator of video games in the world, and we don’t have our own celebration. That doesn’t make sense. The UK has one with the BAFTAs. Obviously, [there’s] The Game Awards [in the U.S.]. There’s so many different ones — D.I.C.E. [in Las Vegas], etc. There’s so many game awards, but there’s no real celebration of our industry […] The video game industry is covered in tech publications or in finance publications when it comes to, “This studio has millions of dollars of investment,” or “This studio is closing or they have layoffs.” That’s usually how the video game industry is covered […] I’m watching Breakfast Television in the morning and they have an entertainment segment and they talk about movies, they talk about TVs, they talk about music. Why don’t they talk about video games? It’s an entertainment medium that’s bigger than the movie and TV business combined. So why don’t we cover this industry as art, as a medium that’s consumed by millions and millions of people? Ubisoft Quebec’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. (Image credit: Ubisoft) Jennifer Hale (Canadian-American actress in Mass Effect, Metal Gear, The Long Dark and more): That’s a piece of the Canadian culture: you don’t brag on yourself. You just don’t. A little [more] celebration might be in order! Leslie Quinton (Ubisoft’s vice president of communications, North America): We kind of punch above our weight, Canada, if you think about our population, in terms of our involvement in those kinds of high-level entertainment things. So the idea is that we definitely have this capacity in Canada. Maybe we’re too “Canadian modest.” We’re too humble! Prakash Amarasooriya (founder and CEO of Toronto-based pop-culture concert company Kashamara Productions): I think a lot of times, Canada hasn’t been seen as globally for its identity in the arts, which is really unfortunate, because we have actually quite a lot of talent. I think it’s just a reputation of being so close to the [U.S.] that we’re so often overlooked. A lot of our biggest stars are in the States, just because of the bigger market. And a lot of times, the Canadian identity also follows suit. And so we don’t get to hone that here. And I’ll be honest, I think Canada can do a lot better job of highlighting a lot of what we have to offer and showcase, “This is what the Canadian identity is about.” I think there’s a lot of opportunity here because of the fact that our Canadian identity is so diverse. And that’s why you have a South Asian man running a company that puts on Japanese projects, as well as other international projects, in a space that’s predominantly European. And I think that just speaks to what Canada is all about — that that can make sense here and also can be successful here. Scott Christian (Toronto’s Hilltop Studios co-founder, creative director, writer and composer on Lil’ Guardsman): I think the issue is how much does a game being made in Canada matter to gamers? There’s obviously a massive push right now to support Canadian-made, but the challenge for developers and publishers is how small relative to the American and international markets the Canadian market is. That being said, the work done by our small but mighty Canadian games media has an impact. I think there’s an opportunity for publishers of Canadian games to create sales, bundles, and events that take advantage of this moment for Canadian creators. But like I said, it’s a tough business case with our relatively small population. […] It would be wonderful to see a Canadian politician give the kind of recognition that France’s president recently lavished on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s developers in the wake of its success. [Editor’s note: the last time we saw something on this scale was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting about Cuphead‘s The Game Awards wins in 2017.] BioWare Edmonton’s Mass Effect series is one of the most beloved in the entire medium. (Image credit: BioWare) Lucie Lalumière (president and CEO of Interactive Ontario): We’ve seen growing awareness of Canada’s world-class video game industry, thanks in large part to journalists and influencers like you, as well as to a wave of grassroots, institutional, and business-led initiatives across the country. A standout example is that in 2025, the City of Toronto declared June as Video Game Month, the first time a Canadian city has made such a bold and public commitment to celebrate our sector. With over 30 events (and counting) planned across June and July, including Toronto Games Week and Giant Video Games, the public will experience the depth and diversity of our video game ecosystem. Funké Joseph (co-founder of Toronto-based Play Underground Games, winner of the Ubisoft Indie Series 2024): A lot of the [local] devs are super welcoming to us […] It clicked for me that Ontario is the spot — Toronto feels so good for making games. And I used to feel like we were so removed from the whole process with things being so L.A.-based and American or just global events. I was like, “It’s not even happening close to home.” But to see how warm and welcoming everyone is? It’s great […] It’s helpful to talk to people and just see all the people, especially at Ubisoft, that went through that experience with us. Jayson Hilchie: Back in 2019, we humanized the people who make video games and interviewed them in their studios [for a video series]. And they talked to us about what they did, where they were from, and how they got into the industry. I’ve been speaking about this since — how do we humanize the people who make games? And any way that we can, we can do that, whether it’s through videos, or whether it’s through interviews, or whether it’s through documentaries — all those things are going to help […] [But] we’re not hitting the average person with those videos. I doubt that they’re getting hit with [documentaries], either. [Electric Playground creator] Victor Lucas has said this numerous times — we’re just not getting the respect on TV. There’s no video game shows on TV. There’s video game shows on YouTube, the video game shows on the web, but there’s no video game shows on TV anymore. When you come home after school, you’re not seeing a show about video games. That used to be normal. And the video game industry has kind of inversely outpaced the TV focus on our industry. Like, we got a lot of focus in the ’90s when we weren’t that big. And now, we’re massive, and there’s nothing. So how do we increase mainstream media exposure of our industry when we’re massive, but there’s just no interest? I agree with Vic on that, it’s a little perplexing. Vancouver-based The Coalition’s Gears 5. (Image credit: Xbox) Rod Fergusson (Blizzard Entertainment’s general manager of Diablo, former longtime producer on Gears of War): I think it’s just trying to represent [Canadian developers] more. I tried to do that when I was in Vancouver at The Coalition. That’s my relationship with Victor [Lucas], and why [I was at Fan Expo] — the notion of being able to try to support the Canadian industry and try to have a little bit more representation. But we never really talked about [how] Gears 4 and Gears 5 were Canadian-made games. But you’re right. When you look at Vancouver and the BioWare stuff and all of the Ubisoft stuff in Montreal, there’s a lot of games here, but we don’t really trumpet it out that “There’s our Canadian games.” So I think it’s more about how we build recognition. But again, it goes down to people. Because I am Canadian, and I tended to be the face of Gears, I tried to be a little bit more out there. But when you think about the two founders of BioWare who retired, the doctors [Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, who co-founded the studio alongside Augustine Yip]… There isn’t really a face of Ubisoft in Montreal. Who’s the personality? And so I think that’s something that’s missing — we don’t have the “movie director face” in the Canadian industry. Who’s the “Vancouver person?” Now that I’m not there, who’s the face of The Coalition right now? They don’t really have one. Who’s the face of all the other stuff? There’s a very great thriving industry in Vancouver, but there aren’t a lot of faces. So I think if we could get more personalities to pop, then we can bring more attention to it. Megan Everett (director of community and live ops at London, Ontario’s Digital Extremes, Warframe): I didn’t even know DE existed and I’ve lived [in London] my entire life. I had no idea it existed. And for obvious reasons, we keep it a little more secret for safety reasons. But we’ve been trying more and more to kind of go that “Canadian grassroots” route [in DE’s popular community videos.] [Creative director] Rebb [Ford] has recently been saying a lot that we’re very “Wayne’s World” in our approach to how we appear and goof off and do that with our players. So I think we’re trying to leverage the more “Canadian-isms” that we have. Leslie Quinton: We had an event [in 2022] where we brought fans in and it was amazing. They were taking pictures of computers that were turned off saying, ‘This is where Rainbow Six is made!” And they were so excited. So we want to show that openness, because there’s not at all a hidden agenda. And also, we need more people in tech. There are simply not enough people — not just in video games, but technology in general. So showing people all the interesting sides to it is obviously in our interest and the interest of the industry. So part of it is making sure we continue to be very visible — these university competitions we do [like the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition] have great visibility and are extremely appealing. Matthieu Dupont (Gameloft Montreal studio head, Disney Dreamlight Valley): I feel putting forward the people who are making the game, so not only the studio heads and the execs, but also the Canadian developers, the Quebecois developers, the Ontarian developers that are working on the game, doing the code, the graphics, the design, [letting] them speak at events, gather them into cross-studio industry events… And hopefully, people start to notice. We have a lot of success, but if you ask players, they don’t necessarily know where the game has been made. Sometimes they don’t care as well; they just want to enjoy the game. But even industry-wise, I think we can do better of giving the mic to developers and let them speak for themselves. Jennifer Hale: One of the things I want to do is reach out to indie devs in Canada, especially. I want to work with Canadian indie devs. I want to support them. It’s not even about me having a role in the game. What I want to focus on is, “How can I support you? How can we all connect?” I have witnessed — quite directly, unfortunately — a disconnect between the Canadian actors union in B.C. and indie developers. I experienced some quite antagonistic stuff that shocked me, honestly, and made me want to reach very directly out to devs to see what I can do to support them. Humberly González giving a rare performance-capture demonstration at Ubisoft Toronto for Star Wars Outlaws. Humberly González (Venezuelan-Canadian actress, Star Wars Outlaws, Ginny & Georgia): I really believe in Canadian talent — there are incredible artists there that maybe sometimes get overlooked because we’re on the other side of the border. But the reality is that they come to us and they cast locally because there is talent. Sometimes the odd one makes it out and they go, “Oh, my goodness,” or when I meet fans and I tell them that I’m based out of Toronto and that we shot the show here, or the movie here, or the game here, and they go, “Really?” And I go, “Yeah! A lot of our cast is actually Canadian.” There are a lot of opportunities [in Canada]. There’s people who are such creators, especially in Toronto — there’s a very creative indie scene, and there’s people who go to school there and stay there and live there. And I think it is such a melting pot of so many different cultures and languages and food. I love Toronto, I love living [here]. Amanda Farough (Canadian game writer, producer, consultant and analyst, Strange Scaffold): We need to be loud, we need to be proud, and we need to keep moving that mission forward — that Canadian games are some of the best games in the world. 1000xResist wouldn’t exist if not for government funding, and, quite frankly, other Canadians taking a chance on a brand-new studio […] We need more of that: more Canadian stories, more stories that celebrate the mosaic of our culture, not the homogeny of our culture, because it’s not homogenous. That is the thing that makes Canada so strong and so beautiful: we are telling distinctly Canadian stories through places like through stories like Venba. That is a distinctly Canadian story, but you wouldn’t know that unless you’re Canadian, unless you, too, grew up in your own diaspora, or you, too, grew up alongside a diaspora. I’m just a white girl from Kamloops, but my friends growing up, a good chunk of them [and] their families, were from all over the globe, and I grew up eating foods that other white kids weren’t eating, and it was such a beautiful education for the kind of life I wanted to live and the kind of life I wanted for my future children. And I love the mosaic of our culture, and we need more stories, more studios, more funding, and louder people to advocate for how amazing the Canadian mosaic is. And it doesn’t have to be stereotypical. Our stories are quiet. That’s what makes our stories so impactful, is that they’re quiet. They’re unassuming. But as Canadians and as Canadian developers, we have to be a lot louder! Venba from Toronto-based Visai Games was one of 2023’s most acclaimed games, winning praise for its strong narrative about an Indo-Canadian family. (Image credit: Visai Games) Jeff Mundee (University of New Brunswick professor, co-founder of Fredericton’s Reframe Games, Noxia Somnia): The thing in New Brunswick is that there’s a lot of communities spread out, and so it’s hard to get people to group and do something more. There’s a lot of hidden game development talent and a lot of game development projects that are hiding out. And I believe that we are stronger together. I want to really push for bringing the groups together and making a go of New Brunswick of being more than just a supplier of talents [and] making more games here. Remy Siu: I think it’s important [to talk about funding] because I really do like thinking about logistics, constraints, and context, and how all those things may affect an artwork. In my previous artistic life, I would watch documentaries about big-name visual artists, working at huge scales, intersecting huge sites, and it would always be awe inspiring, but sometimes I wish they showed how the whole thing was funded — the mundane side of it — how was it produced? I want to see artists in meetings talking to stakeholders and institutions. How did they convince people to do it? To fund it? Maybe that might seem boring to the general watching audience, but I’m sometimes worried that the general populace may think an artist has an idea and then just kind of waves their hand and makes it happen. Whereas, in my experience, most artists are working within tight constraints, and how they deal with those constraints have as much to do with the art as anything. Manda Farough: There are so many studios out there that are dying because there is no money, and the money that is out there is from really questionable places sometimes. I’m not saying universally, but in the United States, which is where I live now, there’s no grants. There’s no funding down here. We don’t have the Canada Media Fund down here. We don’t have Ontario Creates. We don’t have B.C. arts funds. Sasha Boersma (co-founder of Toronto’s Sticky Brain Studios, Rooster): [Our point-and-click Chinese culture and community game Rooster] is heavy on art and animation and wanting it to look right and feel right, so it’s all that finessing. We’ve made 12 minigames with very, very, very simple mechanics. But it’s the magic around it. That’s really what’s taxing on the dev team, and so we just put our decisions in a different place. And we can do that thanks to the Canada Media Fund and Ontario Creates — we’re not beholden to what a publisher says we can give. We can try something different, which is why CMF calls it “envelope innovation.” We’re innovating in a way that no publisher would ever give us funding to be able to try. Funké Joseph: If you’re from Canada, there’s a lot of opportunities to get funding — to prototype, to make something bigger that you want to get commercial — in so many different places in our country. Because not many other places have those opportunities. So I think especially if you’re in Canada, look into those different grants and funding options, and apply. Sometimes, people are like, “I don’t know if I should apply.” Apply! They want people to apply to these things because otherwise, they’re not going to be giving out money. They just want creative projects, a lot of these funders. So if you have that fire, there’s people that can help fund you for “X amount of time” to make that into whatever you want with that idea. So I just want people to know what’s possible and look it up. Lil’ Guardsman is the debut title from Toronto’s Hilltop Studios and has garnered significant acclaim. (Image credit: Hilltop Studios) Lucie Lalumière: Canada has the techno-creative talent. We have the entrepreneurial drive. But we’re not yet seizing the full market opportunity in front of us. The global video game industry now generates more revenue than the film and music industries combined, a clear signal of its cultural influence and economic weight. Take Ontario as an example. While it produces globally successful games across all genres and platforms; develops top-tier techno-creative talent; and represents roughly 40 per cent of Canada’s population; it holds only about 20 per cent of the country’s video game jobs. To bridge that gap and truly compete on a global scale, we need to: cut red tape around existing business incentives; remove barriers to interprovincial collaboration, take bold action to attract and encourage investment and support inbound and outbound international business development. Scott Christian: In so many ways, gaming is borderless. I would love a robust domestic publishing scene, but I don’t think that would have as much impact as increased investment and support for CMF and Ontario Creates grant funding. I think this is what would seed more Canadian and Ontario teams and projects and would have the biggest positive impact. Lil’ Guardsman was supported by a traditional publisher model, which is less and less the norm these days it seems. With Hilltop’s latest project, we applied for these grants, and were successful with one. It’s a lifeline for Canadian developers, and coupled with the OIDMTC (Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit), these programs make it possible for small teams like ours to thrive. These programs work to guarantee that games jobs aren’t leaving the country (or the province with Ontario Creates), which I think is important. Lucie Lalumière: Ontario’s video game ecosystem stands out for its highly skilled and innovative techno-creative talent, diverse and globally minded workforce, entrepreneurial spirit, and economic development incentives, including the new Ontario Creates IP Development Fund and the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit. However, many studios are currently experiencing significant delays in the processing of the tax credit. These delays slow investment in talent and IP development, undermining the credit’s effectiveness and limiting Ontario’s ability to fully capitalize on growing global opportunities. At a time when the video game sector can meaningfully contribute to Ontario’s economy and innovation agenda, this bottleneck is especially concerning. The Ontario government has acknowledged the issue and pledged to address it. The industry is hopeful that a timely solution will help restore this key incentive’s full effectiveness in supporting the growth of Ontario’s video game ecosystem. Mathieu Côté (Montreal’s Behaviour Interactive — game director and head of partnerships on Dead by Daylight): Most of those big companies [in Canada] are not Canadian. Ubisoft is right next door here — they’re French, for the most part. You have Warner Bros., that’s set up not very far away, but they’re American. You’ve got Electronic Arts that has an office, Amazon Games is literally across the street. We have NetEase right there. There’s more and more of those gigantic studios from around the world, which is amazing because it yields a lot of really cool talent, and it makes people grow and it gives people jobs here. But it’s really, really cool to be part of one of the rare Canadian Quebec companies that is still, to this day, very much a Canadian company. Behaviour Interactive, the developer of the massively popular Dead by Daylight, is one of the few major Canadian-owned developers. (Image credit: Behaviour Interactive) Miriam Verburg (CEO and executive producer, Toronto’s Bloom Digital Media, Disney Villains Cursed Cafe): I’ve long supported the idea of developing a publishing fund in Canada […] We could access support for publishing by banding together to create cooperatives to publish together — creating marketing resources that we can share so that we can go out to the wider world with a little bit more ease. And localized games. There is no way to get support for game localization in Canada — like nothing — unless you get a publisher. So if you have a game that’s in English and you want to localize it, you’re just footing the bill yourself and taking that out of revenue, unless you get a publisher, and there are no Canadian publishers. So then if you want to localize your game, you’re going to a publisher in a different country to get your game localized, to get it published, and then that publisher is taking between 50 to 70 per cent of your launch day profits. How can we grow the industry, then? How could we get attention to Canadian games, if we are unwilling to fund anything to do with their sale of marketing? If all we do is go, ‘Okay, let’s, let’s fund production, let’s figure out how to get things made, and then it’s up to the game producers.’ Manda Farough: Let’s be real. What is our publishing landscape at home? It doesn’t really exist [And] what generally tends to go into the back half of putting a game together is you need things like release management — publishing services can do that. You need help with PR, help with marketing, help with working with influencers, localization, quality assurance, localization quality assurance. So I feel like putting together shared resources among developers that have already learned these lessons gives everybody access to knowledge, even if they don’t have access to the services themselves […] Because I think that for the most part, publishing is going to continue to be sparse. There aren’t a ton of independent developers left in the major cities in Canada — all over the place, we’re not even just looking at Ontario or even Quebec. In my home province [B.C.], there were a lot of independent studios once upon a time. It’s too expensive. It’s too expensive to be a developer in Canada a lot of the time, and to scale that, you need equity and you need investment. And that’s also another thing that’s really difficult, private investment, and that’s very difficult to come by in Canada […] Being able to pool those resources is a way to make sure that we’re elevating Canadian developers, and not necessarily putting them at risk, which is nice. Remy Siu: I think we have to figure out a way for banks to bridge-fund indie games at reasonable interest rates, especially based on the milestone systems that most of these funding bodies work on. Both in film and in indie games, the funding bodies expect some level of bridge funding and that can be difficult to get, or expensive […] I’m also not sure why there aren’t more publishers in Canada. I wonder if the digital media tax credits can be extended to those types of entities, for their labour spend (if they don’t already). I will say in Canada, I think we have a lot of self-publishing indie stars! Venba, Slay the Princess, Celeste, and more. Perhaps the culture and environment here does foster the self-publishing indie spirit. Lucie Laumière: Even if more Canadian publishers were to emerge, independent video game studios would still choose partners based not on geography, but on fit. Does the publisher understand the genre? Do they have the right platform relationships? Can they effectively reach the players and influencers in their target markets? Publishing is a global business, and most publishers, Canadian or otherwise, select games based on their market potential, not national origin, unless incentivized to do otherwise. The greater challenge for indie studios isn’t the absence of large-scale Canadian publishers, but the need for more robust support for IP development and commercialization. Today, most publishers expect some level of market validation before committing to a title. That means indie studios must invest early in iterative, market-tested prototyping, marketing and community building to demonstrate a game’s potential. So why not self-publish? Many studios now assume they will, knowing that strong market traction can help attract publishers or investors down the line, and give them greater leverage to negotiate favourable terms if they choose to pursue those partnerships. To keep pace with these industry dynamics, Canada must strengthen its strategic investment in programs like those offered by the Canada Media Fund, particularly to expand support for video game prototyping, marketing and community building. These investments play a critical role in helping Canadian studios bring original IP to market, scale their businesses, and compete in a fast-moving global industry. Carl-Edwin Michel: I actually had that discussion with one of the studios that is coming on board [the CGAs] and they were saying to me that [business-to-business], for them, was the most important thing. Because that’s where they get investors and the support to get their game created. And they were really like, ‘Yeah, the consumer is always going to be there. People are going to buy games. We have the community, it’s fine. And also, we’re a smaller country when you compare us to the U.S. So a PAX or some of those big events, they go to where they think there’ll be a lot of people coming in, and also that they can generate a lot of revenue. I wasn’t in the books of [EGLX], but it was the last big consumer event that we had right in the country. We don’t have to go crazy. We can do something that is decent size and go from there. For me, the Eh! Game Expo [a free public exhibition of demos in Toronto] is a start, and I have a plan to make this thing grow. But I want to grow it organically, and I’m not going to fake it and put investment money to it, and just go to [Scotiabank Arena] or whatever and do something crazy. Strand is the first game from the small new Montreal developer Exnilo Studio. (Image credit: Exnilo) Allie Wilde (PR and marketing lead at Montreal’s Studio Exnilo, Strand): Events like the Eh! Expo are huge for indie devs, especially in Canada, where we don’t have many consumer-facing opportunities like this. Conferences can be really expensive, and like other indie teams, we can’t just dig up loot buried in our backyard to fund every event. So when something like the Eh! Expo comes along, giving us a chance to showcase our game to real players without breaking the bank, it’s massively valuable. Getting direct access to our community and sharing the game hands-on is one of the most important assets we have. As a small team working from home, that can be tough. Seeing players experience Strand in person, watching their reactions, and hearing real-time feedback is crazy valuable. It helps us refine the experience and makes all the difference in shaping the game into something truly special. Beyond just our game, though, there is so much Canadian talent out there. So many emerging studios, all creating amazing work, and we’re all incredibly keen to lift each other up. More events like this wouldn’t just help individual studios, they’d strengthen the entire Canadian gaming scene. We believe “more is more” when it comes to these kinds of opportunities, and we’d love to see even more public-facing gaming events in Canada in the future. Scott Christian: The return of the Canadian Game Awards this year had an impact, and I dream (and scheme) about a “Canadian Indie Games festival” and awards event with a specific focus on Canada’s robust indie game scene. Lucie Lalumière: We’re beginning to see a welcome resurgence of [business to consumer] video game expos in Canada, most notably Game Con Canada in Alberta and the newly announced Video Game Live Expo (VGLX) in Ontario. There are also an increasing number of opportunities for players to engage with games in development, such as The G.R.I.D., a new playtesting-focused event in Toronto […] The province also showcases unique initiatives such as Level Up Showcase, the largest exhibition of student-made games in Canada [and Digital Extremes’] TennoCon, the country’s largest fan event organized by a studio, drawing thousands from around the world to London each year [for Warframe]… On the [business to business] front, Interactive Ontario and our peers at the Canadian Interactive Alliance/l’Alliance Interactive Canadienne (CIAIC) are actively working with XP Gaming Inc. and the Government of Canada to bring international publishers to Canada. Our goal is to create cost-effective, high-impact business opportunities for developers at flagship events like XP Game Summit. Programs like Ontario Creates’ Global Market Development are also essential in supporting international business development, and would benefit from enhanced investment to meet growing demand. That said, the way games are promoted and discovered is evolving. Large-scale in-person/online hybrid showcases like Summer Game Fest; fully digital showcases like Wholesome Games; and global digital storefront campaigns, such as a potential Canada-focused Steam Sale, are becoming vital tools for reaching players, influencers, and industry partners worldwide. That’s why we’re also excited to see new hybrid initiatives emerging in Canada, such as Pixel Power Play in Toronto, which blends public-facing engagement with digital amplification, connecting fans, creators, and influencers, while showcasing Canada’s creative excellence to the world. Thousands of TennoCon attendees wait for a live presentation about the future of Warframe at TennoCon 2024. Megan Everett: Having [our Warframe fan event TennoCon] in London does feel special, because this is where DE has always been. And it gives back to the community, a little bit. It boosts London for hotels, and travel, and people just learn about London. And we try, as we’re doing TennoCon, to let people know best restaurants to go to, bars to go to, libraries to go to. So we’re trying to give back to London as they’ve kind of given us this space. So it’s special to us. And it also is really nice for the employees here being able to bring their family and their friends to it, because most of us are local. So we’re able to have like one big celebration, and you just can’t beat being at home. It’s very comfortable. And logistically, it just makes sense. Dan Vader (game director at Toronto’s Capybara Games, Battle Vision Network): What I love about [something like] Day of the Devs [a non-profit promoting indies] is it puts faces to who makes your games — it shows you the real human beings that are making these things that you love, where they’re from, and I think that’s a great way to demystify the process of making games. It’s just a bunch of people who are inspired to make cool things. There are so many Canadian developers making so many games big and small, and I often get surprised when I find out that this game I’m playing is actually not just from a Canadian dev, but a Toronto dev. I even get surprised by that, and I’m in the industry. And I think if more Canadians, especially young Canadians, knew how big it was, how many opportunities there might be, it might steer the course of their lives. Because when I grew up, I didn’t think video games were made in Canada, I thought they were made somewhere very far off — it was not possible to get into them. And the truth is that there are multitudes of games being made in Canada. These responses have been slightly edited for clarity and length.

Title: How Corporate Events Are Changing To Fit Business Needs

Time Published: 2025-06-02T16:16:00Z
Full Content:
ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. In this uncertain time for business, a recent PwC survey found that more executives now have confidence in the effectiveness of their boards. That’s good news—until you look at the percentage. Only 35% rate their boards’ overall effectiveness as excellent or good, up from 30% in last year’s study. And that’s actually still more of an improvement: 29% gave that rating in 2021 and 2022. In its survey, PwC spoke with 500 executives in different positions, ranging from CEO to chief legal officer and COO. CEOs had the best view of their boards, with 94% saying they were excellent or good. CFOs also viewed them favorably, with 72% ranking them in good esteem. PwC said this may reflect boards getting better in some ways—with members chosen to provide oversight and financial guidance. And the executives that interact the most with boards do tend to rank them the highest. Board members still may be missing some critical expertise, however. Nearly four in five CIOs ranked their boards as fair or poor, which may reflect a lack of knowledge about technology, cybersecurity and AI among members. About 43% of executives said they wanted AI expertise added to their boards this year, but only 10% of board members expected that to happen. Executives and board members both felt that AI is a top priority for boards in the next 12 months. Regardless, the majority of executives believe their boards can come through when needed. Seven in 10 said they believe their board can guide the company through a crisis, while 88% feel their boards can effectively engage with shareholders. And when changes are needed, six in 10 execs are confident that boards can assess their own performance and make needed shifts. Whether that faith in the boards is merited remains to be seen. As the year progresses into the unknown, the strengths of these boards—and executives’ confidence in them—are likely to be put to the test. Even though the shutdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic era are in the rearview mirror, corporate events and trade shows are becoming increasingly important to businesses. I spoke with Janet Dell, CEO of events company Freeman, about how events are changing to reflect today’s workforce—both in attendees and goals. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order imposing tariffs on imported goods at the “Liberation Day” press conference. The majority of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs were struck down in two federal court cases last week, although it’s certainly not the end of the issue. A three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade ruled that the so-called reciprocal tariffs announced as part of Trump’s “Liberation Day” press conference should be “set aside.” The panel ruled that Trump did not have the authority to impose unlimited tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives presidents the power to impose sanctions during national emergencies. In a second lawsuit brought by a group of companies, Washington, D.C. District Judge Rudolph Contreras also found the tariffs to be illegal. But for now, the tariffs—or threat thereof—are still on. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused the order halting the tariffs while those judges rule on an appeal. In the meantime, there is still action with new tariffs and existing negotiations. Trump announced a 50% tariff on imported steel and aluminum last week, which goes into effect this week, at an event at U.S. Steel. And negotiations continued last week with China, although progress remains unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Thursday that talks have stalled. Friday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social that China “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.” Monday morning, Chinese authorities shot back, accusing the U.S. of breaching the agreement that both countries came to last month, saying the U.S. introduced “discriminatory restrictive measures against China” after the talks, including expanded export controls on AI chips and other chip-building technologies. Regardless of the broader tariff fight, companies are now starting to reflect the impacts—or projected impacts—in their earnings reports. Forbes senior contributor Shelley E. Kohan analyzed how the nation’s five largest retailers—Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger and Home Depot—are handling tariffs. Companies with significant non-grocery sales have pulled forward inventory purchases before tariffs took effect, trying to stay ahead of the impacts on price. Home Depot executives said they can maintain competitive prices and don’t expect broad increases, while Walmart executives indicated that they will not be able to completely mitigate tariff-related increases. Costco, Kroger and Walmart are all trying to keep their food prices down, especially since consumers have been paying more over the last several years—though popular products, including bananas, coffee, avocados and flowers, are almost always imported. Meanwhile, many of the companies are changing their supply strategies, not relying on any one country for goods or manufacturing. Many businesses continued to lower their outlooks for the rest of the year, given tariff uncertainty. Last week, Best Buy, Macy’s and Abercrombie & Fitch all reduced their sales and earnings projections for the year. President Donald Trump walks with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in 2017. Last week was another bumpy ride for the stock market, with ups and downs related to tariffs, government financial reports and Big Tech. April’s inflation figures remained relatively mild, not yet showing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1% above April 2024, the lowest PCE inflation rate since last September, and getting close to the Federal Reserve’s sweet spot of 2% inflation. However, economists at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs both forecast a jump in tariff-related inflation to 3.6% by December—though they say it is not expected to be as sharp of a jolt in price as the post-pandemic inflation of 2021 and 2022. The lower inflation rate, however, doesn’t mean that interest rate cuts are set to happen anytime soon. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee’s early May meeting were released last week, and they indicated that the Fed is planning to continue to watch the impacts of Trump’s planned policies—which to date have been sudden, jarring and unpredictable—before making any moves, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes it’s unlikely there will be any changes to interest rates before the end of the year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with Trump last week, and Powell reaffirmed that the Fed would continue to make policy decisions “based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Regardless of the indicators last week, small businesses are feeling decidedly less optimistic, writes Forbes’ Brandon Kochkodin. The April Small Business Optimism Index, published monthly by the National Federation of Independent Business, showed optimism down to 95.8, below the 51-year average of 98, and down 1.6% from March. Retail business owners had the lowest scores, with optimism of 93.7. More than three-quarters said supply chain issues were impacting their business, and 14% said their inventories were too low. But negative feelings are running high across all sectors; the most confident sector in April was construction, and that was down nearly 4 points from January. getty As federal government attitudes on diversity, equity and inclusion push the issue to the back of corporate priorities, companies are talking about it a whole lot less. According to an analysis by Gravity Research, references to DEI and associated terminology in Fortune 100 company reports dropped 72% between 2024 and 2025. The acronym DEI saw the largest drop in mentions—down 98%—while more neutral terms about diversifying, such as “inclusion” and “belonging” were down by more than a third. The only place where mentions of DEI increased was on earnings calls, where the term came up 390% more often—but usually because of more shareholder questions about it. Gravity Research Vice President of Thought Leadership Joanna Piacenza said the report “speaks volumes to the current political environment,” which has made diversity initiatives a polarizing issue—as well as a legal one. Freeman CEO Janet Dell. Events have retained their popularity through the pandemic, but are changing based on attendees and preferences. I talked to Janet Dell, CEO of global event company Freeman, about why events are still so successful and vital for business. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. During the pandemic and soon afterwards, many Baby Boomers retired, and the workforce now has many more Millennials and Gen Zers. How have events changed to reflect the age of the attendees? Dell: Each of the demographics has a different preference in general. The younger demographics—Gens Z and Alpha and Millennials—want that face-to-face engagement. They’re looking for ways to get more professional development opportunities, connect with buyers, learn about what’s cutting edge in their industry in particular, because there’s a lot more hybrid working arrangements. Events are turning into “bleisure” events, where you’re going out for the event and staying a few days after. People are looking at ways to make it easier because talking about the digital native versus a digital hybrid. We’re helping support the events, partnering with someone with AI tools that can help you match-make. Or it can help you understand dwell times and engagement when you go through a booth. So our exhibitors know: Is this impactful content? Am I optimally set up? [We also make] sure there’s more time in the events for people to talk to one another. I would say one of the bigger changes pre- and post- pandemic is not overscheduling, and trying to give people more time to engage and immerse, and not just going back-to-back-to-back on things, straight into a happy hour, then a dinner, et cetera. There’s more of a consumer slant versus B2B, where they’re really thinking about the customized individual experience versus a blanket use-the-same-formulas-as-they-did-before. We’ve got a lot of new, fresh ideas, married with a lot of long-tenured people that have been in events, experience and exhibits for a long time. Looking at some of the recent research Freeman has done, people place a huge amount of trust in what they see, learn and experience at events. Has it always been that way? It’s always been the most powerful medium for building trust is face-to-face. You can’t beat bringing someone together, having a conversation, reading the verbal and the nonverbal cues, and then interacting live. That’s what people missed in the pandemic, and why there was this incredible pent up demand. We saw virtual events be adopted. They have a place, and it’s much more inclusive. But then when people came back,[there was] just incredible demand, and it held up. Ninety-four percent say this is the biggest trust-building medium. It allows you to grow your interpersonal skills. You can gain professional confidence, and you stay on cutting edge in the industry. It also helps close business, in terms of commerce and retain clients because you’re showing them all the benefits of what you’re doing. Once you leave that event, 87% of the people that have attended are more likely to go to your website. You’ve got that 365-day connection, which is what you want to see with your clients to make sure that they stay loyal to your brand. What do executives need to know about events? They need to be clear on what their objective is. We do thousands of events a year and we bring in 400,000 to 500,000 exhibitors. They have to be clear on what their objective is for the event. Why would you be attending? You can get matched up with the right event to be able to take advantage of that. If you can do that, then you can start planning out how you're going to take advantage of it, whether it’s through sessions, keynote speakers, the trade show floor, experiences or one-to-one special events like hosted-buyer-type scenarios. All those things can have a more personalized experience and therefore a better return on it.

June 02, 2025 12:07 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc.

[Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

It is all go in comics distribution news today. We looked at where some employees at Diamond Comic Distributors had found new jobs recently, but just hit the motherlode. With seven senior Diamond Comics staffers now at Alliance Entertainment or AENT. Alliance Entertainment is, of course, the company that successful won the auction to buy Diamond Comic Distributors as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, saw Diamond reject that deal, only for the bankruptcy courts to reinstate it, and then for AENT to pull out again, alleging fraud over the way the Wizard Of The Coasts contracts were presented. And is now suing Diamond over these allegations. So, yes, Alliance Entertainment, AENT, the company that is suing Diamond for millions after having tried very hard to acquire the distributor, has just hired five of Diamond's longest-standing staff members, and given them senior positions within the company. AENT boss Bruce Ogilvie is looking smarter by the day. Just as long as he doesn't go on any podcasts to talk about it all. You can use these Diamond, Ad Populum, Penguin Random House, AENT and bankruptcy tags to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool. Here's a timeline if you want to catch up… Enjoyed this?

Title: Circle Eyes $7.2B Valuation in Upsized U.S. IPO Amid Strong Investor Demand

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming for a fully diluted valuation of up to $7.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company now plans to offer up to 32 million shares priced between $27 and $28 each, up from 24 million shares at $24 to $26 when it first filed in May. The move suggests investor interest in Circle’s business is growing, and possibly heating up faster than expected. That interest appears to be coming from some of the world’s most influential investors. In May, it was reported that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is considering purchasing up to 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, according to people familiar with the matter. Ark Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, has also signaled intent to buy $150 million worth of stock. Circle’s IPO comes as stablecoins are having a moment in the broader crypto market. Once considered niche instruments mostly used for crypto trading, they are now widely integrated into decentralized finance (DeFi), remittances and even traditional finance rails. The total market cap of all stablecoins now stands at $248 billion, with Tether’s USDT making up 62% of the market at $154 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $60 billion, according to DeFiLlama.

Title: Meta is going all-in on AI advertising

Meta (META) believes that the source of 97% of its revenue can be fully automated by AI: its ads. By the end of 2026, Mark Zuckerberg’s company will employ AI to work with brands to create their own advertising — imagery, video and text — and then target them to specific users on Meta platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. The ads could even be made specific to geolocation and time, reflecting local scenery or weather conditions in the imagery. Along with potentially making design departments obsolete, it could disrupt video production as well. Major advertising companies such as Omnicom Group saw their stock prices drop following the news. On an earnings call for Meta’s Q1 2025 report in April, Zuckerberg said, “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in [businesses’] products. I think that this is really redefining what advertising is — into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale.” Meta’s first-quarter revenue was up 16% year-over-year, to $42.31 billion. Ad impressions were up 5%; the average ad price increased 10% year-over-year. Use of AI tools in creating ads increased by 30% that quarter. “If we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,” Zuckerberg said then. The company is putting its money where Zuckerberg’s mouth is, investing $65 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Last month, Zuckerberg was touting the idea of AI friends and chatbot therapists as a solution to the loneliness epidemic.

Title: ELV STOCK: Suffer Losses on Elevance Health, Inc.? BFA Law Notifies Investors of Imminent July 11 Securities Class Action Deadline (NYSE:ELV)

June 02, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Your best bet for finding a new job could be looking at your old one

Welcome back! The start of another week could mean a scramble to figure out what you're eating every night. A registered dietitian suggests these 15 items at Costco that can be healthy, quick dinners and satisfying snacks. In today's big story, the best bet for job seekers might be returning to a familiar place. What's on deck Markets: The top hangout spots for Wall Street's incoming interns. (You decide whether you want to visit or avoid them.) Tech: New data shows how quickly chatbots are scooping up human jobs. Business: Some franchisees for Floyd Mayweather's fitness business are taking legal action against the legendary boxer and the company. But first, what's old is new again. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The future of the job market might be about looking in the past. Job seekers and their former companies are finding comfort in reconnecting as both sides navigate a challenging job market, writes BI's Madison Hoff. ADP payroll data for March indicated that the share of boomerang hires increased since the same time last year. It's no surprise that workers and their old bosses are teaming back up. The economic uncertainty has everyone on edge, and dealing in known quantities offers some relief. For job seekers, returning to a previous employer could mean stability and security that you might not typically find at a new job. Meanwhile, employers are being cautious about making new hires. They want to be certain about the ones they do bring on. A former worker whose capabilities are already known could ease those concerns. Not everyone will be welcomed back to their old stomping grounds. When workers held all the power in 2021, some made rash decisions as they headed for the exits, which could come back to bite them. They "rage quit," or used a red-hot job market to create bidding wars for themselves. The ones who stuck around sometimes took it easy, avoiding the #hustleharder culture for a new trend: quiet quitting. Even if you think you're in good standing with your old bosses, you might be wrong. BI previously reported how tech companies like Meta and Microsoft have "block" lists of ex-employees they won't rehire. Things could also be a lot different than what you remember. At one point, companies were happy to hand out flashy titles and quick promotions to keep workers happy. Efficiency and frugality are now all the rage, and the status an ex-employee once held might not remain. Like an eldest child returning from college only to find their younger sibling has taken over their room, the times have changed. 1. Oasis Management founder's jet-setting month. Seth Fischer spoke at three different Sohn conferences across the globe in May. He's passionate about the Sohn Foundation, which focuses on childhood cancer research and prevention, and is named after his former colleague, who died from the disease at age 29. 2. Wall Street's "uber-bear" warns about potential stock declines. Albert Edwards, who shot to fame for predicting the dot-com bust in the late 1990s, told BI that stocks are still vulnerable. In his opinion, the top risk the market should be wary of is rising Japanese interest rates. 3. Where Wall Street's summer interns hang out. Hundreds of college students will soon descend upon New York City as they start their summer programs on Wall Street. Industry insiders spoke with BI about the top spots interns frequent when they're not pulling all-nighters. 1. AI is already taking human jobs. Companies are hiring fewer people in roles that AI can do, according to data from Revelio Labs. Not all jobs are disappearing at the same rate — those with more AI-doable tasks are vanishing faster, which is bad news for people in tech. 2. Southeast Asia's tech startups are chasing the American dream. Traditionally, startups from the region focused on local markets, but AI is piquing their interest in building for the US. Plus, having American customers is good for fundraising. 3. How the robots get made. Amazon is spending big on robots and automation for its fulfillment centers. BI got an inside look at how the robots are made and trained in facilities outside Boston. It's a glimpse into the new US manufacturing. 1. A legendary boxer's fitness business is struggling, and everyone is pointing fingers. At its peak in 2023, Floyd Mayweather's Mayweather Boxing and Fitness had 70 locations. Dozens have closed. The boxer's attorney pointed to wider industry challenges, like a slowdown among boutique gyms. Some franchisees say Mayweather could have done more to support the business. 2. Bride or die. Bachelorette parties aren't just about ibuprofen and bikinis. Nowadays, women book dayslong vacations that include merch and decor to prove their love to the bride. These trips are often just as anticipated — and can even be as expensive — as the big day, bolstering a whole new subset of the economy. 3. Don't blame DOGE. Elon Musk said DOGE was treated unfairly by its critics, and became the "whipping boy for everything," in an interview with CBS that aired on Sunday. Though he's leaving his role as a government employee, Musk said he'll continue to work on DOGE, albeit on a part-time basis. Campbell's reports earnings.

Title: Luxury Brands Sweat Consumer Discounting After Price Hikes

Brands that cater to the uber wealthy saw a dip in sales for the first quarter of 2025, continuing a slowdown that started last year. Crystal Kim Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Everything is not so “gucci” in the world of luxury goods. Brands that cater to the uber-wealthy, including LVMH’s Christian Dior, Kering’s Gucci, and Chanel, saw a dip in sales for the first quarter of 2025, continuing a slowdown that started last year. While CEOs of luxury goods retailers are chalking up the challenging environment to macroeconomic turbulence, market analysis suggests the industry’s excesses of the past few years could be contributing to weakness. While luxury goods companies have largely been immune to the state of economies, the decline that started last year could accelerate into 2025, Morgan Stanley analysts Eduoard Aubin and Arunima Sinha said last week during a state-of-the-market discussion at the firm’s luxury conference in Paris. Chinese nationals and Americans, the two cohorts expected to drive more than 50% of total spending in the next three to five years, are traveling less. Fewer Americans are heading to Europe, and fewer Chinese people are flying to Japan, which could translate to weaker sales in the second quarter than in the first, according to the analysts. Waning business optimism about China and weakness in US consumer spending also do not bode well for the industry. Chanel, which usually raises prices a couple of times a year, is in wait-and-see mode on potential hikes, global CFO Philippe Blondiaux said in a recent interview with Vogue Business. Some luxury retailers are chugging along, with Hermès and Cartier parent Richemont reporting sales growth in the first quarter of 2025 from the year prior. The price of the smallest Birkin bag rose to $12,700 in May, per Sotheby’s. Luxury brand companies’ best years coincided with the largest increases in US households’ net worth. Profits nearly tripled between 2019 and 2024, with the four biggest luxury companies — LVMH, Hermès, Richemont, and Kering — taking the lion’s share, per a McKinsey report published in January. Price hikes, some of which were as high as 100% on certain goods, accounted for approximately 80% of industry growth during that period, the report stated. Demand for leather handbags, branded jewelry, and watches reached a fever pitch as US households’ net worth rose by $51 trillion between 2020 and 2024. Much of that went to the top 20%, or households earning more than $160,000, which were supported by a rise in financial wealth (Read: stock markets going up): Yes for Less: Recruiting might be difficult. Value-conscious shoppers’ behavior lately shows regular folks are prioritizing function over fashion. James Conroy, chief of Ross Stores, said in an earnings call in May: “In terms of customer behavior, perhaps you could say there’s a little bit of a shift towards more functional items versus discretionary items.” The surprising news comes just ahead of an all-important jobs report from the Labor Department due out Friday. As China tightens its grip on rare earths exports, one of its most crucial bargaining chips, the global supply chain is showing cracks. Snacks now make up around half of the historic soup company’s sales, up from less than a third a decade ago. 2025 is projected to be an unusually terrible year for the US travel industry — and only the US travel industry. At less than three years old and with just ten products, Rhode is a rocket ship with $212 million in net sales last year. The Fed was already walking a tightrope over a bottomless pit of stagflation before waves of tariffs came to rattle the line. You can’t bounce back without first getting low. And, in April, consumer confidence according to the Conference Board got real low. While the company didn’t mention the threat of tariffs, Nike is heavily exposed in China, home to roughly 24% of its suppliers. After the auction, the yield on the 20-year note rose to 5.125%, the highest level since back in November 2023. Soft US inflation numbers released last week and a de-escalation of global trade tensions are likely contributing to bitcoin’s rebound. CATL — blacklisted by the US Department of Defense in January for alleged ties to the Chinese military — pulled off the best IPO of the year. Klarna’s 100 million-user win sounds nice, but its users are increasingly struggling with the “pay later” part of the arrangement. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: ‘Freedom Cities’ and Our Tech Overlords’ Visions for the Future
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/06/freedom-cities-and-our-tech-overlords-visions-for-the-future.html
Time Published: 2025-06-02T10:00:38Z
Full Content:
Hierarchical tech weasels made a splash in early May with their vision for Guantanamo Bay. The Charter Cities Institute (CCI), a front group for billionaire Silicon Valley interests, wants to turn the home of US torture chambers into a high-tech charter city, which will double as a “proving ground” for migrants seeking to enter the US. Those lucky enough to make it to the imperial heartland might find themselves in Guantanamos anyways. That’s because so-called “freedom cities” might be coming to the 50 states as well. What Are the “Freedom” Cities? Elon Musk recently got his company town in Starbase, Texas, which could be viewed as a first step toward a US where these billionaires create laws in their own jurisdictions that fit their personal needs. To bring about Starbase, in December 2024, more than 70 county residents (believed to be SpaceX employees) petitioned for an election to make Starbase its own municipality. In May it passed overwhelmingly. Starbase can now raise funds through taxes, acquire property through eminent domain—which it is already doing— and create its own zoning rules. It has its own mayor and two commissioners—all SpaceX employees. “Because this is a project that is closely affiliated with SpaceX, you can imagine that the goals for the municipality are probably in pretty close alignment with the needs of SpaceX,” Alan Bojorquez, an attorney who specializes in city governance, told Texas Tribune. Indeed, one of the biggest benefits for SpaceX of the incorporation may be the ability to avoid environmental red tape. In July 2024, conservation groups filed a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration, alleging that it rushed SpaceX’s Starship permitting process without adequate environmental review or mitigation requirements. SpaceX is also facing fines of almost $150,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency for allegedly illegally dumping pollutants into a Texas waterway without a permit. Starbase will almost certainly pass its own more permissive rules, and the Texas government is already voting to give Starbase more authority over the closure of a popular beach on weekdays for launches. Along with Starbase, other tech giants are planning their own build outs in cities where they already run the show, dominating real estate and local government. Google is planning a massive neighbourhood around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Meta is doing the same thing with “Zucktown” in Menlo Park, and Musk wants a Tesla town, too. Many write-ups on Starbase and the freedom cities compare them to the company towns of old where one business owned and controlled everything, surveilled the population, paid workers in“scrip”, and led to startling rates of suicide and addiction among citizens. That very well may be the future for some— if not most — of these freedom cities, but there’s another darker layer to this current push, which makes these new-age company towns more problematic. While some of the freedom cities may be partially or wholly devoted to quasi-slave labor and human lab rat tests there also exists the possibility of population engineering to them, as well as to the rest of the country they would be leaving behind. From Urban Geography: Freedom Cities are thus, not merely land development schemes; Freedom Cities are where deserving elements of the population are promised perks and subsidies that favor family formation and will build out the favored community as a replay of a mythologized past… As a political maneuver, the Freedom Cities plan’s core purpose is precisely to conjure new cities in a distinctly fascist mold and generate a shared desire across the Trumpian movement not just to carry out a clean break with present-day cities but to turn their backs on the latter. In the imagined new city of his movement, prosperity and safety abound, while elements that have been cast as undesirable, abject, and anti-American are forcibly kept out through intensive policing and state protection. The Charter Cities Institute (CCI) and others are lobbying the Trump administration for more than just the creation of company towns theoretically under the jurisdiction of the state. They essentially want their own statelets within the US. The argument is that exemption from some federal laws replaced by oversight by a tech baron would drive innovation and prosperity. Here’s more from The New Republic: More controversially, CCI proposes to do something very akin to what the Emiratis are best known for doing—erecting a labor economy that more readily resembles modern-day slavery. The big selling point for its GITMO haven suggests that the hypothetical city could house migrants who wish to move to the U.S., keeping them under surveillance for a “probationary period” while “evaluating their contributions to the local economy and society.” “High performers become prime candidates for U.S. residence, while those who disrupt public order can be repatriated quickly—no labyrinthine state courts involved,” the authors write. Frontier Foundation, a 501c4 organization, as well as the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for American Innovation, are also on board. In April, the groups issued a joint letter to the Trump administration that begins: We, the undersigned founders, investors, builders, and scholars write to express our strong support for Homesteading 2.0, consisting of the Home Sweet Home and Freedom Cities initiatives designed to add 3 million new homes and drive American economic and technological dynamism. It goes on to argue that the Bureau of Land Management should sell of 600 square miles of land for Freedom Cities. The Frontier Foundation has its eye specifically on BLM outside cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon. The details of how the cities will actually function and who will own and run them are sketchy but appear similar to Starbase with perhaps even more “freedom.” Here is more from the letter (caution: high levels of dynamism incoming): The newly established urban districts, with streamlined governance and targeted regulatory relief, hold tremendous promise for accelerating American innovation, strengthening our industrial base, and addressing the most pressing economic and technological challenges facing the United States. Paired with new urban development, Freedom Cities can offer a dynamic regulatory framework for re-shoring critical industries, expanding housing affordability, and facilitating rapid progress in emerging fields such as biotechnology, aeronautics, and energy. By removing red tape, Freedom Cities can create jobs, improve global competitiveness, and push the technological frontier. Much of their argument includes the promise that these freedom zones will have affordable housing. And in case it wasn’t clear from the letter, the Frontier Foundation’s policy memo also includes the following: Regulatory Opt-Out Mechanisms: Grant the Secretary-level heads of agencies, such as the Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Transportation Secretary (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules, discretion to waive or expedite certain regulations within Freedom Cities. Streamlined Environmental and Building Approval: Mandate expedited National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews and simplified building codes, ensuring that infrastructure, housing, and industrial projects can break ground within months rather than years. Who Is Behind the Freedom City Push? Much of the money flowing into the likes of the Frontier Foundation, CCI and the Foundation for American Innovation are shrouded in secrecy due to their status as 501c3 non-profit organizations that have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS. But the Foundation for American Innovation, as an example, identifies numerous billionaire laundering services as “major supporters” including the Miles Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Beth and Ravenel Curry Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and the Searle Freedom Trust. Two major players behind the movement, which is being driven by the likes of Marc Andreesen and Peter Thiel who back the venture capital firm Pronomos Capital, which has funded a charter city in Roatán, Honduras and several city projects in Africa, including one in Nigeria called Itana. [1] Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, tells WIRED that he and other Próspera representatives working under an advocacy group called the Freedom Cities Coalition have been meeting with the Trump administration, which is unsurprisingly receptive. During his 2024 campaign Trump came out in full support of the freedom cities: Reportedly the administration is so enthusiastic that the plan has grown in scope from creating ten such cities to as many “as the market can handle.” Why Do Tech Overlords Want Them? The official line is a collection of all the usual BS out of Silicon Valley. We can look to the rantings of Marc Andreesen for evidence. Andreessen, the billionaire who co-founded the venture capital firm a16z and, before that, played a role in the invention of the modern web browser. He is also one of the major backers of the freedom cities, as well as a major player in the Trump administration and a driving force behind the Signal groups that began during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which fueled the new alliance of tech and the US right. Andreessen is considered some sort of wise sage by the hierarchical tech crowd. Take the word of Minicircle cofounder Mac Davis who is also working with the Frontier Foundation. Minicircle is a longevity biotech company focused on developing gene therapies to extend human lifespans. It’s backed by Thiel and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and it currently has offices in both Austin, Texas, and Próspera. According to WIRED, Davis says that Minicircle’s gene therapy clinical trial on the protein follistatin—which he claims increases muscle mass without side effects, and also has life-extending benefits in mice—was only possible in Próspera, but noted he’d like to see that change. And it will, he believes, when freedom cities bring “American Dynamism” a reference to writings from Andreesen screeds, which argue that tech companies under the leadership of their wise billionaire leaders will save us from our failing government institutions and the pratfalls of democracy. Let’s take a brief look. Here’s Andreesen’s “The Techno-Optimist Manifesto” going beat poet on us with his societal visions: There are only three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology. Developed societies are depopulating all over the world, across cultures – the total human population may already be shrinking. Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political. And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology… Productivity growth, powered by technology, is the main driver of economic growth, wage growth, and the creation of new industries and new jobs, as people and capital are continuously freed to do more important, valuable things than in the past… We believe this is why our descendents will live in the stars. We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology… We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. We believe free markets are the most effective way to organize a technological economy. …Profits are the incentive for producing supply that fulfills demand…. We believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder… We believe there is no inherent conflict between the techno-capital machine and the natural environment… We believe we should place intelligence and energy in a positive feedback loop, and drive them both to infinity. We believe we should use the feedback loop of intelligence and energy to make everything we want and need abundant. We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life. Note Andreesen’s emphasis on abundance, which Democrats are now embracing to slash the red tape and let the vultures feast in an effort to get back in the good graces of money men like Andreesen. And notably, Jeffrey Mason, the head of policy at the Charter Cities Institute, tells WIRED the freedom cities lobbying groups are also having conversations with Democratic members of Congress. So this reimagining of the US as a federation of billionaire-run emirates will have staying power beyond Trump. But back to Andreesen and the ideology he represents. His whole spiel is that anyone or anything standing in their way is preventing the creation of this utopia: A world in which human wages crash from AI — logically, necessarily — is a world in which productivity growth goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero. Consumer cornucopia. Everything you need and want for pennies. — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 25, 2025 It is of course all complete nonsense. What Andreesen and his like are after is more money and power of which company towns or freedom cities are a major part. Here’s Brian Merchant summing up their true motivations at Blood in the Machine: These notions—AI can replace workers, the government should function like a startup—are not meant to describe reality; they are meant to create a permission structure for those in power to obtain more of it. Here, AI will either allow Trump and Musk to install more loyalists, hollow out the administrative state, or degrade the quality of services once provided; all outcomes that favor Trumpism, and, I guess, Muskism. The startup mentality, meanwhile, seeks to give license to break laws, in the name of progress, of disruption, of building the future. Same as it ever was: Way back in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, early factory owners deployed automation to deskill workers, to justify employing precarious and child laborers, and as a means of circumventing long-held laws—all to produce more products at lower quality, and to concentrate profits, and power, in fewer hands. That helps explain why despite Andreesen’s promises that earthly paradise is nigh, he and his fellow weasels spend so much time and money worrying about building a police state. Andreeseen is focused on his primary home of Las Vegas while other tech billionaires have their own pet projects. That makes sense if you subscribe to the teachings of monarchist pundit Curtis Yarvin who was reportedly lionized in the Andreessen-led Signal chats. Here’s Quinn Slobodian on Yarvin’s vision for the future—much of which is playing out in real time: Right-wing accelerationists imagine existing sovereignty shattering into what Yarvin, writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, calls a “patchwork” of private entities, ideally governed by what one might call technomonarchies. Existing autocratic polities like Dubai serve as rough prototypes for how nations could be dismantled into “a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions.” These would be decentralized archipelagoes: fortified nodes in a circuitry still linked by finance, trade, and communication. Think of the year 1000 in Middle Europe but with vertical take-off and landing taxis and Starlink internet. Yarvin expressed the essence of the worldview recently when he enthused over Trump’s proposal to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip and rebuild it as a US-backed colony securitized as an asset and sold to investors—as he called it, “the first charter city backed by US legitimacy: Gaza, Inc. Stock symbol: GAZA.” One wonders what type of Gaza they have in mind for their American freedom cities. This? Or this: Or perhaps the first is a freedom city and the latter is one of the left-behind zones? How Soon Could We Find Out? Here are the options under consideration to breathe life into stateside freedom cities according to WIRED: According to Goff, Freedom Cities Coalition has briefed White House officials on three options for creating freedom cities. One is through “interstate compacts.” In this scenario, two or more states could set aside territories with shared tax and regulation policies, with some state-specific carve-outs. Under existing law, these compacts can’t be revoked, though they can be dissolved under certain circumstances. If an interstate compact is approved by Congress, it becomes valid under federal law. Goff says the coalition is considering Congressional legislation that would give “advanced consent” to any freedom city compacts. That way, Congress wouldn’t need to approve each individual city. Two other options are creating federal enclaves with special economic and jurisdictional zones, or having Trump issue executive orders to create each new freedom city. The freedom city lobbying groups are urging that sites would ideally be announced by July 4, 2026. So mark your calendar! One concern with such cities is that they would hollow out the rest of country since they would be free from regulation from the likes of Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (A bunch of nuclear reactors in freedom zones powering AI data centers free of any oversight from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission—what could go wrong?) That “freedom” from oversight would draw investment and jobs away from the rest of the country choking on its last morsels of democracy. But perhaps DOGE and other Trump administration destruction of the state are an attempt to do the hollowing out before the building of the “freedom” cities. By starving all but the Pentagon and and Homeland Security of funds and intentionally blowing up the ability of the state to function, the administration helps make the case for freedom cities. Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor argue in The Guardian that we are in the midst of “end times fascism”, which they claim is even worse than the mid-20th century version. While that might be a bit hyperbolic, perhaps we’ll get there at this rate. Regardless there’s no doubt that the Silicon Valley illuminati have designs to take us to—or leave us behind in— a dystopia of their making, and they have a government ready to accommodate them: Inspired by a warped reading of the political philosopher Albert Hirschman, figures including Goff, Thiel and the investor and writer Balaji Srinivasan have been championing what they call “exit” – the principle that those with means have the right to walk away from the obligations of citizenship, especially taxes and burdensome regulation. Retooling and rebranding the old ambitions and privileges of empires, they dream of splintering governments and carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries, serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies. Personally, I’d be inclined to let ‘em have at it—if those living in their little fiefdoms are there of their own volition, the creation of their statelets didn’t involve the destruction of ours, and their actions weren’t destroying our shared earthly habitat. It doesn’t appear any of those three conditions will be met, however, which leaves me with just one question: What’s the progress report on Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars? That sounds like an ideal solution for all—except the red planet. Musk, Andreesen, Thiel, and friends could bring all their AI, crypto, and court jesters there and be completely free there to pursue their utopia. Notes 1. The Honduran Congress passed a law in 2022 repealing the allowance of SEZs. Próspera then sued the Honduran government. The lawsuit is ongoing and, as of now, Prospera remains operational. Another example of a “Freedom City” is Disney World, where Florida cut a deal to give the corporation exclusive rights to develop the land as they saw fit, and a carve out from any state or local law enforcement. When Disney went “woke”, the governor tried to rescind some of the legislation but I don’t think it was eliminated. Disney also did this with an experimental city they built called “Celebration”, which actually exists. And people flock to see the Mouse by the millions. Been a while since I’ve seen the Matrix (while Keanu Reeves is a stand up human being from what I can tell, he is a terrible actor! – can’t stomach his movies), but if I recall correctly, a generation ago the movie wondered whether given the choice, people would prefer physical reality or a computer generated fantasy world, all watched over by machines of loving grace. A quarter century later, with people moving about staring into their phones immersed in tiktok videos and AI-generated crapola, I think we have our answer. The problem with the current iteration of Freedom Cities is that the machines watching over us are neither loving nor graceful. to paraphrase great art critic Robert Hughes re. cities/urbanity and the 5000-year, quixotic quest for the perfect city: “it seems that much like plants, we need the $h…it of others to survive…” from his “Shock of the New” book/tv series re. urban planning….a TV series I sorely hope that AI will be able to clean/upscale to 4K in the near future even bill gates-backed city is in the desert. hey, I hate winter too…but the Arizona desert in July? (when there are practically infinite large tracts of “Sim City”-like land near the Great Plains interstates or just look at all the vacant lots of detroit/buffalo…Tech bros really hate snow, lol Catherine Austin Fitts on the Danny Jones show. Musk and the creation of the control grid. utube, 8+ minutes. Trump’s “Control Grid”: 3 Steps He’s Using to Enslave Americans | Catherine Fitts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqayjnlBjk Or perhaps the first is a freedom city and the latter is one of the left-behind zones? It goes deeper. Andresson’s “sources of growth” leaves out another possibility. Growth by stealing resources from other people. The “left-behind” zones are not left out or apart from the supertech system. They are the fundamental resource being extracted to pay for the high tech cities. The misery is the point. No matter how hard those in deprived zones work, no matter how much value they create, their surplus value will simply be siphoned off to pay for the lifestyle of others. The only limiting factor to this system is the additional resources which must be allocated to pay for the oppression and subjugation of such territories or social classes. As the inequality deepens, only massive investments in oppression technology will be able to make the project scale. But simultaneously the availability of technology enables more effective dissent and resistance among oppressed populations. The likes of Andresson will see a lot of money to be made in this dynamic. Sucked out from the downwardly mobile middle class mostly. Just a reminder that the Solano County based “California Forever” project wasn’t gone away and the most recent pivots include proposing a ship building project and annexation by two cash strapped local cities to get around county regulation. A slow grind by investors with deep pockets and a huge land bank. https://californiaforever.com/ https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/california-forever-tech-boats https://www.thereporter.com/2025/05/12/suisun-city-gives-california-forever-update/ Not sure the opposition is up to the task https://www.solanotogether.org/about “Personally, I’d be inclined to let ‘em have at it—if those living in their little fiefdoms are there of their own volition, the creation of their statelets didn’t involve the destruction of ours, and their actions weren’t destroying our shared earthly habitat.” Remember: it’s a heist. And they are like the ultimate culture vultures. Not creators. Any competition has to be destroyed to keep people in those dystopias…not out. If those freedoms are responsible for their own security and enforcement of laws, go for it. When they are subject to assault by other entities I w8sh them well. Unless there is no alternative (TINA), they can’t sustain their dystopia. Bet there is a part 2 that hasn’t been revealed for their “freedom cities” that shows plans for “Greater Freedom Cities”. “When they are subject to assault by other entities I w8sh them well.” The global spread of something like neo-liberal economic ideology should be looked at as the “hegemony”. Bringing it back down to earth: rich influencers flock together like birds of a feather. Is there a material difference between freedom cities and abundance cities? From my perspective there isn’t any. no. two sides of the same 5,000 year-old technocrats’ dream: (healthy) cities are chaotic, choked w/ traffic, inefficient, full of micro-triggers; but I, Raymond Cocteau, can solve all the problems and bring more joy if only everything was made per my diktats Personally I welcome the incoming oligarchic paradigm these cities represent if only because it’s so delightfully cyberpunk. I dream of pacing down a rainy dystopia-city street, smacking myself beside the head to mute the google adsense brainchip feeding me information about cosmetic products on my way to my 17 hour shift in the anthro-ambulatory energy center (definitely not a series of giant hamster wheels for humans). Top 10% generators each month get an extra box of reduced-plastic content nutripellets! One person’s cautionary tale is another person’s operations manual. This whole thing is coming off like a real-life version of OCP in the original Robocop movie. Unfortunately, a lot of Robocop’s predictions are coming true, right down to the idiotic ads in everything. It’s time to dust off Snowcrash, Bioshock, and all the other fiction which addressed the ludicrous contradictions of isolationism and power in planned capitalist enclaves. Heck, take a trip to Tuscany, where the great towers of the great families were seized and torn down by competing fiefdoms. Any broligarch archipelago willing to bro Galt against civilization as a concept via “networked” freedom cities —a broligarchipelago?— will discover in short order there shall be no network, instead thousands of cities laying violent siege to one another. Meet the new medieval, same as the old medieval. Additionally, there are other 80s sci-fi threads weaving through society. Watched Running Man lately? (Appropriately based on a story from Stephen King – which puts this mess squarely in the HORROR sci-fi genre where it belongs). Looks like gated communities are not enough and now they want to go for gated cities. And those sea-based communities have never gotten started. I can make a few predictions though based on past performance. Any of these cities will demand billions of dollars from the Federal government for infrastructure but will also demand that the Federal government have no say in how their cities are run. Each city will have a poverty-stricken town nearby from where workers will be bused in daily to perform the menial work that needs to be done in that city. Going in the opposite direction will be garbage and waste materiel to that town for “processing”. Each city will tap any underground water and proceed to suck it dry as it leads to less water to farmlands near that city. Each city will demand goods, services from the State government or else they will move that city away. Unsurprisingly, State governments will believe them. The inhabitants will be monitored and surveilled to a massive degree and they may even have to tolerate a camera up the wazoo. All the collected data will then be monetized and sold on. Finally, these cities will on the whole be not really safe for women who will have no recourse through the private police. Those sort of boats will not be allowed to be rocked. Not in a libertarian tech-bro culture it won’t. Also, seat belts and motor-cycle helmets will be illegal. This will only work when the menial tasks are automated, so robotic cleaners and gardeners. But who grows stuff and who repairs and installs stuff? The elite tend not to have practical skills beyond one narrow discipline. These cities aren’t arcologies, and are completely dependent on the outside for resources just like Masada. The Gulf States seem to have no problem with this proto-neofeudalism. In all Gulf States subcontinent Indians = big minority; in a couple,a majority of the population. all fine when there is plenty of money….when times are lean (and those workers can’tor won’tgo home)? Perhaps the denizens of the nearby poverty towns will have the mordant humor to rename them ” Poortowns”. And then start referring to the Freedom Cities as “Freedom Johannesburgs” and the Poortowns as ” Freedom Sowetos”. And then figure out how to move disease germs into the Freedom Johannesburgs. Perhaps the Freedom Soweto Resistance will figure out how to create time-delay binary poisons. And then figure out how to dose every Freedom Citizen of the Freedom Cities with one of the two binary poison ingredients, cumulative, non-removable from the body. But entirely innocuous until the second ingredient is added to find the first ingredient in every Freedom Body and combine with it to produce the lethal poison with lethal effect . . . when the Zero Hour Time comes. Fordlandia; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordl%C3%A2ndia Wonderful piece. A reminder that the internet made a bunch of incel gamers billionaires. This is all just End Times rationing and hoarding. It’s ironic that they can’t see that just like Gaza (and Mars), their land is available because it doesn’t have reliable water or decent conditions for raising crops or livestock. They will never be self-sufficient. They’re think that they can turn their backs on us, but we can and will turn the tables on them. “Careful what you say. The assassin drones have ears.” You have to assume the Freedom Cities will try every highest techest method to detect or anticipate, and then exterminate, every such attempt at turning the tables. The would-be table turners will have to work out ways to survive all of that in order to live long enough to get those tables turned. “Freedom Cities” or any of the charter city startups have yet to demonstrate successful implementation of even a small housing development. I’m not sure if Starbase qualifies. It’s a small number of employees living at the launch site. It’s hardly a “Freedom City” or “Charter City” as envisioned by the libertarian utopians. For a more dramatic description of what might come, one could read Margaret Attwood’s MaddAdam trilogy. Didn’t think it was possible I could loathe Yarvin more than I already did but then I read his opinions about Gaza and had to step away from the computer for several minutes to bring my blood pressure down. This post and Conor’s book review post today reminds me strongly of a book I read a couple of years ago about the Southwest Desert here in the US, The Water Knife. A science fiction book about a potential near future… with lots of science backing it up. Nice little Freedom City you got here. Be a shame if a semi full of attack drones had to pull over somewhere nearby, amiright? This threw me for a loop. Apparently, for some Americans, the idea of freedom is to seek permission from the relevant governmental authorities to start a municipality, so as to create by-laws, rules and regulations, and so as to start taxing the residents. As opposed to finding an unincorporated area, keeping it unincorporated so there are no rules, bylaws and regulations, no local taxes, and you can do whatever you please. Anybody remember Jack London’s The Iron Heel? The Iron Heel, novel by Jack London, published in 1908, describing the fall of the United States to the cruel fascist dictatorship of the Iron Heel, a group of monopoly capitalists. Fearing the popularity of socialism, the plutocrats of the Iron Heel conspire to eliminate democracy and, with their secret police and military, terrorize the citizenry. They instigate a German attack on Hawaii on … BTW, there are two remaining Defendants being sued for price fixing by the Forever California crowd. And so the 2nd and 3rd generation looks around at the “less free” cities and towns and says “bull pippy” and starts a revolution in these freedom cities. Oh, but that’s right, the tech monarchists always knows best and will “correct” the revolutionaries. 40 years ago there was Rajneeshpuram in Oregon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneeshpuram what goes around comes around. Thanks for this excellent article Conor. I’ll add a couple of details. Pronomos Capital which you mention as a leader in the emergence of “freedom cities” is the baby of Neo-Reactionary poster boy Patri Friedman. Formerly, Friedman ran the (Thiel-funded) Sea-Stedding Institute. Thiel and Friedman were the two main writers in the legendary/infamous 2009 Cato Unbound issue which one could argue marks the beginning of 1. nRx thought 2. Post-democratic libertarianism. Friedman’s article Thiel’s article If one can wade through the sophomoric logic, both articles are illuminating regarding the current libertarian onslaught. Also I see other posters referencing Snow Crash and I’ll point out that it gets cited regularly in Thielverse circles and apparently changed (Thiel sidekick/LinkedIn founder) Reid Hoffman’s life Finally I’ll repeat the recommendation to read Max Chavkin’s biography of Thiel “The Contrarian” which covers a lot of this ground. It has just occurred to me that this movement among the tech overlords is just another version of a deep but rather thin American impulse to an ideal communal existence. The Mormons are an outgrowth of such impulse. The Shakers and hippie communes ultimately failed. New Age spiritual communes basically failed although there are remnants. There are countless cults ongoing at any one time. Attempts at ashrams on the Indian model come and go. Most involve charismatic leaders, big donors and a desire to escape from whatever by the followers. This just seems the cyberpunk version. The same old problem still exists….how do all these brilliant, high IQ, hyperindividual lights get along? Same as it everywhere was. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Fear Martin Marietta At $550?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. UKRAINE - 2021/05/24: In this photo illustration, Martin Marietta logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone and pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Martin Marietta Materials Inc (NYSE: MLM) stock fell 27% from its all-time high of approximately $620 in November 2024, decreasing to $453 in April 2025. It then rebounded by about 22% to current levels around $550. Thus, the stock is down roughly 11% since November, despite the company reporting an operating margin exceeding 42% in 2024. In comparison, Meta reported operating margins of 42% in 2024 and has still seen an increase of 9% from early November to now! However, there’s an important point to consider: Martin Marietta trades at 32 times earnings. Reversing that gives a meager 3% earnings yield. For reference, Meta—which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs—trades at a significantly lower earnings multiple of 23 times and is growing revenue almost twice as quickly. Meta's revenue has grown by 13% over the last three years, while MLM experienced revenue growth of 6.7% during the same period. So yes, Martin Marietta benefits from consistent infrastructure demand which ensures stable cash flows and strong returns. But at $550 per share, this represents a premium valuation pursuing a growth narrative that simply isn't keeping up. And what happens when the growth fails to meet expectations? That’s when reality sets in. See Buy or Sell MLM stock? MLM is frequently regarded as a long-term asset that will gain from sustained urbanization, infrastructure enhancements, and population growth, but history paints a different picture. During the 2008 global financial crisis, its shares plummeted nearly 64%. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020, they dropped by 49%. Moreover, in 2022, amidst rising inflation and consumer pressure, Martin Marietta faced another setback with a 33% decrease. Not exactly resilient—yet currently, the stock trades at a premium valuation. MLM benefits from stable demand propelled by infrastructure expenditures, particularly owing to government initiatives like the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Projects involving highways, bridges, and public works necessitate substantial volumes of aggregates — MLM's core product. Furthermore, MLM stands as one of the largest providers of construction aggregates in the U.S., which affords it pricing power and economies of scale. Its size and vertical integration enhance operational efficiency. MLM consistently showcases strong earnings, significant free cash flow, and high returns on invested capital. Yet the broader context is less exciting. As of the first quarter of 2025, Martin Marietta has encountered a notable rise in its debt levels, mainly due to strategic acquisitions and capital investments aimed at expanding its operations. Debt was reported at $5.41 billion as of March 31, 2025, marking a significant increase from $3.95 billion at the conclusion of 2024. The company disclosed a debt to EBITDA of 4.06 for the quarter ending March 2025, which surpasses the industry median. The company reported solid performance for the first quarter of 2025. Revenues totaled $1.35 billion, reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase. In FY26, the company has projected revenues between $6.83 billion and $7.23 billion, indicating a growth of 5 to 10%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to increase by around 9%. That’s hardly significant growth for a company valued like a hyper-growth tech stock. Adding to the difficulties are weather-related risks. Operations can be disrupted by hurricanes, storms, or other extreme weather events, which have historically caused production delays and impacted revenue. Despite valuation pressures and macroeconomic risks, MLM's scale provides it with considerable advantages. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the IIJA, which allocates $1.2 trillion for infrastructure projects over five years. As of early 2025, roughly 66% of highway and bridge funding is yet to be utilized, suggesting a substantial pipeline of projects extending through 2026 and beyond. In Q1 2025, Martin Marietta reported a 6.8% increase in the average selling price of aggregates to $23.77 per ton, driven by organic price/cost improvements and margin-accretive acquisitions. This pricing momentum is likely to persist, bolstering revenue growth. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, exhibiting less volatility as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: What does WPP Media’s course change actually mean for advertisers?

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → GroupM’s rechristening as WPP Media last week was intended to answer questions posed by clients, staffers and industry critics about the future of what was once the industry’s largest media investment house. But beyond the sizzle reel, question marks remain over what’s actually changed — and whether this is the end of WPP’s long-running quest to turn the ship around, or just the latest chapter. In particular, there are queries around the company’s AI ambitions; how close they are to becoming reality; what that reality means for its own employees; and how they help it put clear blue water between itself and rival heavyweight media holdcos Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (soon to include IPG). GroupM is gone, and WPP Media has been set up in its place. Going forward under its new captain Brian Lesser (who is also its old captain), the network will operate with a single P&L model in each country, while the global CEO positions of its constituent agencies have been abolished. Former Wavemaker CEO Toby Jenner has been instead named global chief business officer, while Mindshare’s Adam Gerhart has taken on a brief as chief client officer, for example. “Advertisers don’t like disruption. They don’t like not knowing what’s going to happen with their team. They don’t like when they start spending more time thinking about their own business than their clients,” said Tom Denford, CEO and co-founder of media consultancy ID Comms. This isn’t just about tidying up the org chart, but a significant shakeup in the engine room of WPP. Execs are keen to push the benefits of the bespoke cross-disciplinary teams it’s built for clients like Amazon, Unilever and Coca-Cola. In each case, the custom units combine media, creative and data capabilities, and are built with WPP’s data businesses Choreograph and Infosum (acquired just two months ago) as connective tissue. Lauren Wetzel, CEO of InfoSum, referred to this approach as “showing up as one company.” WPP Media’s leaders believe more clients want the white glove treatment – and a simplified organization structure makes those teams easier to assemble and easier to run. “Clients want us to come together and have an integrated offering,” said Wetzel. Behind the scenes, the changes have already led to significant job cuts at the network, though a WPP spokesperson declined to say exactly how many of its 40,000 staffers were made redundant. Layoffs will continue until at least June, per Ad Age. Incumbent clients, however, are keen to be reassured their own account teams remain in place. They want both continuity of service, and to be reassured they won’t be forgotten when WPP Media goes hunting for new custom in its fresh costume. Perhaps that explains why, despite retiring the 20-year old GroupM moniker (originally intended to manage WPP’s sprawling media agency domains, rather than a market vehicle in its own right) the Mindshare, Wavemaker, and EssenceMediacom agency brands remain intact. Digiday understands that the agency brands will aid WPP Media in navigating potential client conflicts, while also pitching for new work in their own right. According to Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, the remaining firewalls, combined with the addition of Infosum, will also help reassure clients that other advertisers won’t have access to their data. The new structure will “wall off their clients’ first-party data from any losses in data fidelity, or security or privacy concerns,” said Pattisall. WPP Media’s leadership aren’t using the “a” word to describe the new entity. Not that one, anyway. No longer a network of media agencies, WPP Media will instead function as an “AI-driven media company”, per the spiel of a B2B ad campaign it’s launched to float the rebrand. In plain English, that refers to the way its teams use WPP Open, the company’s AI operating system, as well as other AI tools and automation. According to Evan Hanlon, global CEO at WPP data business Choreograph, every team within the business is already using Open to plan and invest media on behalf of clients. This will supposedly free them from the “drudgery” of manual media planning and enable them to pursue more creative solutions. “It’s something that our people are not only in every day, but that our clients are seeing and experiencing and having work delivered for them,” said Hanlon. Even if clients choose only to work with EssenceMediacom or Wavemaker, rather than the cross-border packages WPP Media is prioritizing, they’ll still be customers of teams using Open. “Every client that we onboard now is being onboarded into that end-to-end, AI-powered ecosystem,” said Hanlon. “Through the end of the year, we’re looking to bring 100% of WPP Media onto that workflow as well.” Teams aren’t limited to using WPP’s proprietary toolbox, but can integrate tech that clients have built in-house as well. “We are not putting our clients in a position in which they have to lock into a fixed, inflexible, closed system,” he said. WPP Media isn’t the only media network to have switched to a single P&L, or to remodel its interior around a data business. And it’s far from the only way advertisers can access AI tech. However, Hanlon said WPP Media’s approach to audience data would be the element that helps it stand out from the crowd. Rather than sell access to audience datasets it owns – and compete directly with Meta or Google – WPP Media aims, through InfoSum’s clean room tech, to help clients leverage the first part data they do have, and provide probabilistic audience targeting. It’s a solution clients can’t easily build in-house or get from the tech giants, and one that should keep advertisers above the water line on privacy compliance. “Every one of our competitors is pursuing a strategy that is focused around owning large-scale audience datasets as the focal point for how they extract more value from the marketplace,” said Hanlon. Deterministic approaches, he said, are just “one of many” ways to target media. “We think that is one place that we are fundamentally different to our competitors.” If its leaders can articulate that offer in the pitch room, it could be compelling for clients, according to Sam Tomlinson, chief client officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “WPP Media will need to work through this integration quickly so they can then focus on a clear articulation of the benefits of their data strategy, building on InfoSum and explaining how it is different to their competitors,” he said. Ultimately, Forrester’s Pattisall believes WPP Media as described has a strong chance to improve its fortunes, regardless of whether it keeps any clients that might be in play (such as Mars, which is currently in review and which WPP CEO Mark Read acknowledged is in play back at the end of April). “They’ve made massive acquisitions, they’ve consolidated their operations and they’re providing end-to-end services rather than point solutions,” said Pattisall. “It’s certainly working for Publicis Media, it’s working for Omnicom Media Group … I think it would work for WPP Media as well.” — Michael Bürgi contributed to this report. As influencers and creators capture more attention (and ad dollars) from marketers and agencies looking to break through with prospective customers, Advertiser Perceptions looked into how they’re being used and evaluated, as well as how dollars are being allocated. Some highlights from the study, which surveyed 305 marketing and agency folk: “I would not at all be surprised that sooner than later, influencer [as a] channel will be much bigger than television. I don’t know if it will be in three years or five years, but that’s something which is going to happen.” Agencies and SSPs are pairing up for partnership deals, driven by demand for premium inventory and greater transparency. Will Doherty, svp of inventory development, teases launch at IAB Tech Lab Summit, claiming 90% of Deal IDs are ‘effectively failed’. The move was likely a cost-savings effort, which would mean that Publicis most likely offered to secure lower rates for the entertainment company’s marketing efforts.

Title: “Something wicked this way comes,” Ray Bradbury (1962)

Time Published: 2025-06-01T21:37:58Z
Full Content:
It was a great and horrifying story about two young boys and the arrival of the Cooger and Dark Carnival in Green Town, Illinois. If you entered the carnival grounds late at night, you might be drawn to its iconic ride, Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show. It’s a story about the ways in which evil can be a powerful temptation to even the best of people. Some of the lines are maddeningly good. A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know. Others half-haunt me. Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? How men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives, who know they will live forever. Bradbury declared it his most “delicious” story. The title is also an homage to the witches of Macbeth (Act 4, Scene 1, following “boil and trouble”): 2nd Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking] Open locks, Whoever knocks! [Enter Macbeth] I admit to having been thinking of dark circuses and evil clowns rather a lot lately. They make it hard to pick up the newspaper most mornings. Chief Justice Warren got it, too: “I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records man’s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man’s failures” (Sports Illustrated, July 22, 1968). For readers of the Mutual Fund Observer, two coming circuses will be particularly pressing. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and leveraged single-stock ETFs are relatively new and complex investment products that have garnered significant attention from both investors and researchers. I was struck by the utter flood of new fund registrations in the first weeks of May, which might signal a July or August. Launch. In the middle of 2024, there were about 100 such funds globally. The first in the US seems to have been AXS Tesla and AXS NVIDIA, both launched in 2022. Trading volume and AUM data are scant. Morningstar did report a doubling in the pool’s AUM in the first quarter of 2024. What do they do? In general, they do not own the single stock in question. They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually. According to current market data, there are literally millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation (really, you could make your own this afternoon since there are no regulations and no barriers to entry). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 18.6% in Q1 2025 to close at $2.8 trillion, after briefly touching $3.8 trillion in January. This dramatic swing within a single quarter exemplifies the type of volatility that could devastate retirement portfolios, particularly for investors nearing or in retirement who have limited time to recover from significant losses. Consider, for example, the drawdown periods for the oldest and most liquid coin, Bitcoin. Source: LazyPortfolioETF, using Highcharts graphing. Remember, this is just the downside. There are lunatic price spikes the rest of the time. The point here is to help you get a big picture of how deep the knife plunges (the red drawdowns) and how long the wound lasts (the gray “ramps” shows months to recovery). Below are the five-year risk-return metrics for the two largest cryptocurrencies, which we assume are the two most likely to infiltrate a retirement plan. Sources: Lazy Portfolio ETF (for Bitcoin), Portfolio Labs ETH-USD, and S&P Ethereum Index The data reveals several alarming characteristics that underscore the inappropriateness of these investments for retirement accounts. Bitcoin, despite being the most established cryptocurrency, has experienced maximum drawdowns exceeding 70%, meaning investors could lose more than 70% of their investment. The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak. For retirement investors, such sustained periods of substantial losses could prove financially catastrophic, particularly for those requiring portfolio withdrawals during retirement. The smaller cryptocurrencies are worse. Retirement investors require stable, predictable growth that preserves capital while generating reasonable returns over long time horizons. The documented maximum drawdowns approaching 95-96% for major cryptocurrencies represent existential threats to the retirement security of elderly investors. The extreme volatility documented in this analysis represents not an investment opportunity but rather a fundamental threat to retirement system stability and individual financial security. These decisions, government and corporate, continue to move the markets in the direction of a casino. Investors’ conviction that “patience is for losers” just makes them losers. Buy quality stocks from experienced managers. Diversify away from assets that depend on Washington acting like adults. Find managers who manage volatility thoughtfully. We list them! What’s an investor to do? Learn from the experience of others. When you suspect something wicked is around, do not go alone into the basement with a flickering light. When you suspect something wicked this way comes, do not wander off on your own – away from the security of friends – “to see what made that noise.” “Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.” ― Ray Bradbury, Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962) David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts).

It was a great and horrifying story about two young boys and the arrival of the Cooger and Dark Carnival in Green Town, Illinois. If you entered the carnival grounds late at night, you might be drawn to its iconic ride, Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show. It’s a story about the ways in which evil can be a powerful temptation to even the best of people. Some of the lines are maddeningly good. A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know. Others half-haunt me. Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? How men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives, who know they will live forever. Bradbury declared it his most “delicious” story. The title is also an homage to the witches of Macbeth (Act 4, Scene 1, following “boil and trouble”): 2nd Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking] Open locks, Whoever knocks! [Enter Macbeth] I admit to having been thinking of dark circuses and evil clowns rather a lot lately. They make it hard to pick up the newspaper most mornings. Chief Justice Warren got it, too: “I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records man’s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man’s failures” (Sports Illustrated, July 22, 1968). For readers of the Mutual Fund Observer, two coming circuses will be particularly pressing. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and leveraged single-stock ETFs are relatively new and complex investment products that have garnered significant attention from both investors and researchers. I was struck by the utter flood of new fund registrations in the first weeks of May, which might signal a July or August. Launch. In the middle of 2024, there were about 100 such funds globally. The first in the US seems to have been AXS Tesla and AXS NVIDIA, both launched in 2022. Trading volume and AUM data are scant. Morningstar did report a doubling in the pool’s AUM in the first quarter of 2024. What do they do? In general, they do not own the single stock in question. They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually. According to current market data, there are literally millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation (really, you could make your own this afternoon since there are no regulations and no barriers to entry). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 18.6% in Q1 2025 to close at $2.8 trillion, after briefly touching $3.8 trillion in January. This dramatic swing within a single quarter exemplifies the type of volatility that could devastate retirement portfolios, particularly for investors nearing or in retirement who have limited time to recover from significant losses. Consider, for example, the drawdown periods for the oldest and most liquid coin, Bitcoin. Source: LazyPortfolioETF, using Highcharts graphing. Remember, this is just the downside. There are lunatic price spikes the rest of the time. The point here is to help you get a big picture of how deep the knife plunges (the red drawdowns) and how long the wound lasts (the gray “ramps” shows months to recovery). Below are the five-year risk-return metrics for the two largest cryptocurrencies, which we assume are the two most likely to infiltrate a retirement plan. Sources: Lazy Portfolio ETF (for Bitcoin), Portfolio Labs ETH-USD, and S&P Ethereum Index The data reveals several alarming characteristics that underscore the inappropriateness of these investments for retirement accounts. Bitcoin, despite being the most established cryptocurrency, has experienced maximum drawdowns exceeding 70%, meaning investors could lose more than 70% of their investment. The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak. For retirement investors, such sustained periods of substantial losses could prove financially catastrophic, particularly for those requiring portfolio withdrawals during retirement. The smaller cryptocurrencies are worse. Retirement investors require stable, predictable growth that preserves capital while generating reasonable returns over long time horizons. The documented maximum drawdowns approaching 95-96% for major cryptocurrencies represent existential threats to the retirement security of elderly investors. The extreme volatility documented in this analysis represents not an investment opportunity but rather a fundamental threat to retirement system stability and individual financial security. These decisions, government and corporate, continue to move the markets in the direction of a casino. Investors’ conviction that “patience is for losers” just makes them losers. Buy quality stocks from experienced managers. Diversify away from assets that depend on Washington acting like adults. Find managers who manage volatility thoughtfully. We list them! What’s an investor to do? Learn from the experience of others. When you suspect something wicked is around, do not go alone into the basement with a flickering light. When you suspect something wicked this way comes, do not wander off on your own – away from the security of friends – “to see what made that noise.” “Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.” ― Ray Bradbury, Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962) David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer. David is a Professor of Communication Studies at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois, a nationally-recognized college of the liberal arts and sciences, founded in 1860. For a quarter century, David competed in academic debate and coached college debate teams to over 1500 individual victories and 50 tournament championships. When he retired from that research-intensive endeavor, his interest turned to researching fund investing and fund communication strategies. He served as the closing moderator of Brill’s Mutual Funds Interactive (a Forbes “Best of the Web” site), was the Senior Fund Analyst at FundAlarm and author of over 120 fund profiles. David lives in Davenport, Iowa, and spends an amazing amount of time ferrying his son, Will, to baseball tryouts, baseball lessons, baseball practices, baseball games … and social gatherings with young ladies who seem unnervingly interested in him.

They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually. According to current market data, there are literally millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation (really, you could make your own this afternoon since there are no regulations and no barriers to entry). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 18.6% in Q1 2025 to close at $2.8 trillion, after briefly touching $3.8 trillion in January. This dramatic swing within a single quarter exemplifies the type of volatility that could devastate retirement portfolios, particularly for investors nearing or in retirement who have limited time to recover from significant losses. Consider, for example, the drawdown periods for the oldest and most liquid coin, Bitcoin. Source: LazyPortfolioETF, using Highcharts graphing. Remember, this is just the downside. There are lunatic price spikes the rest of the time. The point here is to help you get a big picture of how deep the knife plunges (the red drawdowns) and how long the wound lasts (the gray “ramps” shows months to recovery). Below are the five-year risk-return metrics for the two largest cryptocurrencies, which we assume are the two most likely to infiltrate a retirement plan. Sources: Lazy Portfolio ETF (for Bitcoin), Portfolio Labs ETH-USD, and S&P Ethereum Index The data reveals several alarming characteristics that underscore the inappropriateness of these investments for retirement accounts. Bitcoin, despite being the most established cryptocurrency, has experienced maximum drawdowns exceeding 70%, meaning investors could lose more than 70% of their investment. The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak. For retirement investors, such sustained periods of substantial losses could prove financially catastrophic, particularly for those requiring portfolio withdrawals during retirement. The smaller cryptocurrencies are worse. Retirement investors require stable, predictable growth that preserves capital while generating reasonable returns over long time horizons. The documented maximum drawdowns approaching 95-96% for major cryptocurrencies represent existential threats to the retirement security of elderly investors. The extreme volatility documented in this analysis represents not an investment opportunity but rather a fundamental threat to retirement system stability and individual financial security. These decisions, government and corporate, continue to move the markets in the direction of a casino. Investors’ conviction that “patience is for losers” just makes them losers. Buy quality stocks from experienced managers. Diversify away from assets that depend on Washington acting like adults. Find managers who manage volatility thoughtfully. We list them!

(NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify as well as certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

Title: Book Review: Stephen Witt’s Take On Nvidia, ‘The Thinking Machine’

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The world becomes more amazing by the day. The surest evidence of the previous assertion is that wealth inequality continues to soar. Yes, you read that right. Inequality is a wonderful thing opposite the apologetic tone about it taken by left and right. Members of the left plainly disdain it, while members of the right claim it doesn’t exist in the way the left imagines, that thanks to transfer payments (yes, wealth redistribution by government) inequality isn’t that “bad.” Except that it’s not bad. It’s great. How could remarkable achievements that power wealth creation be bad? If someone comes up with a cure for paralysis, will readers demand that the cure never reach the marketplace lest the creator grow rich? The beautiful, freedom-infused meaning of wealth inequality came to mind while reading Stephen Witt’s new book, The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World’s Most Coveted Microchip. Nvidia co-founder Huang was already billionaire bracket rich when Nvidia was largely a company popular with gamers, but it’s been Nvidia’s central role in the rise of AI that will increasingly do and think for us in ways that will propel billions into amazing work they can’t not do, that has resulted in Huang achieving centi-billionaire status. Thank goodness for inequality. It signals stupendous, life-enhancing improvement. Huang was already a relentless worker, but it was in 2014 when employee Bryan Catanzaro truly opened Huang’s eyes to the possibilities of AI, and Nvidia’s potential to lead it. After that, and in the words of Witt, “there was only work” for Huang. “There was only AI.” As Huang saw it, AI was “O.I.A.L.O.,” a once in a lifetime opportunity. Huang had the best talent, and he would use it to usher in a future where machines yet again think in addition to doing. Per Witt, the new software “can speak like a human, write a college essay, solve a tricky math problem, provide an expert medical diagnosis, and cohost a podcast.” And that’s just the early stuff. To read Witt is to find out that the known with AI has pedestrian qualities relative to what remains unknown, and even better, what’s not yet been discovered. Markets are a look into the future, equity prices in particular, and Witt quotes Nvidia employee Bas Aarts as saying about what’s known only to those in the proverbial arena, that it’s of the “Wow, I cannot believe this is possible in this age” variety, that “people are oblivious about what is already going on. People have no clue” about the amazing leaps on the way. There’s your inequality. It’s once again born of making the world so much better. The bet here is that AI will unearth human achievement that will render the poorest parts of Africa prosperous, all the while unearthing human flourishing globally that will make the abundant, incredibly prosperous, and – yes – beautifully unequal present appear Bangladesh poor and relatively wealth equal by comparison. Which requires a pause. Just as everyone reads a different book, everyone reviews the same book differently. The review you’re about to read is being written by someone who hasn’t a faint clue about how to “back up” a computer, “upload” a medical form, or even connect a laptop to a printer. This is a way of saying in advance that while Witt’s book is heavy on technical jargon of the CPU, GPU, and CUDA variety, this review will largely focus on the presumed meaning of Nvidia’s ascent to one of the world’s most valuable and most important corporations. Some will ask what’s the point of reading a review of a book about the man and corporation behind a remarkable technological leap since the writer is a technical dolt. It’s a fair point, but one that arguably misses the point. That’s because it doesn’t take someone technologically proficient to grasp the brilliance of work divided across as many hands, machines, and mechanical minds as possible. Even better, it’s not unreasonable to suggest that the mechanized technological genius that’s here and that’s on the way will render the technological illiterates of today the technologists of tomorrow exactly because so much formerly done by humans will be handled by machines. Time will tell. For now, it’s best to start with gratitude for the opposite thinkers. Huang is clearly one of them. Witt writes in the book’s introduction that he’s setting out to tell “the story of a stubborn entrepreneur who pushed his radical vision for computing for thirty years.” As is frequently stated here, there’s no “majoring” in entrepreneurialism simply because no one chooses to be an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurialism is a state of mind, it’s a path certain individuals can’t not take. It’s not planned because it’s not obvious. Furthermore, if it were obvious it wouldn’t be entrepreneurial, and it wouldn’t be entrepreneurial simply because what’s obvious is already being done. To show how outlandish Nvidia’s path was, just look at its valuation along with Huang’s net worth. Oh wow did they ever discover something amazing. Wealth inequality is the measure of this happy truth. Huang as most know is of Taiwanese descent, though his parents (his father was a chemical engineer) sent him and a brother to a boarding school in Kentucky until they arrived. Not a fancy school (though it’s fancier now thanks to Huang), it’s believed Huang’s parents didn’t really know. They perhaps just guessed it was a school full of somebodys instead of one full of misfits. Which on its own is a story. What’s important is that where Huang went to school wasn’t going to matter, nor did it. To his parents, and ultimately him, the U.S. was the goal. Good athletes in the capable sense just need to get here. That's the hard part, while the rest is elevation. When he went off to college, it was Oregon State, not Stanford. In Huang’s words, “I just followed my best friend.” Really, what could school teach him? Genius can’t be taught, which is no insight. Genius was Huang’s parents getting his talents to the United States. The rest was his own invention. How to major in AI since AI wasn’t a thing, or at the very least wasn’t an operable thing when Huang was making his way up. Gaming was primitive. No need. Entrepreneurs create. They invent. Huang and the remarkable talent he cultivated would invent the future, not be told how to do it by some academic. The individual in Bryan Catanzaro whose passion helped spark Huang’s own passion for AI was a humanities major. Hopefully conservatives convinced colleges and universities should pay the federal government back when their graduates don’t thrive read Witt’s book. One’s major is immaterial, particularly in an economy as dynamic as ours. Work that can be taught is, by definition, old news. Out of Oregon State in 1984 Huang secured a job with Advanced Micro Devices. The pay was $28,700/year. Following AMD, Huang went to work for LSI Logic. He rose quickly, and was running a $250 million division when he, along with Sun Microsystems employees Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, decided to pursue what became Nvidia. Even though they were told that the market for PC video gaming hardware was “crowded,” entrepreneurs have evangelical qualities about what they’re doing. Huang clearly did. The bullet-riddled Denny’s where they started making plans for Nvidia is open to this day, and is located at 2484 Berryessa Road in San Jose. Apparently Huang still goes there, and tips in the thousands after ordering all manner of menu items (including chicken fried steak – good taste!) that he eats part of. Huang had even once worked at a Denny’s. Anecdote sucks, but Huang plainly had the immigrant desire to assimilate himself. Of course he did. Conservatives who should know better claim “we” can’t properly assimilate immigrants, but there would never be a need even if there were a real “we” beyond the rhetorical one. Implied in immigration is a desire to assimilate simply because immigration is an expression of a rich-person desire within some of the world’s poorest to increase the value of their labor. Sequoia Ventures, arguably the world’s greatest VC, was along with Sutter Hill the early source of Nvidia’s funds. No less than Don Valentine (Cisco Systems, among others) told Huang after his subpar pitch that “Wilf Corrigan says I have to fund you, so you’re in business.” Corrigan was the head of LSI. He saw up close that Huang was going places. Notable about Nvidia is that it started strong. It’s NV1 chip for video gamers sold in the 100,000 range, and as sales grew so did Nvidia. The problem was that the chips soon enough stopped selling, and their prices were lowered. In Huang’s words about Nvidia’s beginnings, “Every single decision we made was wrong.” Which is an economics lesson on its own. Nvidia’s “recession” was the recovery, or would-be recovery from an NV1 error seen as “catastrophic.” When governments fight recessions they dampen the recovery. That’s the truth about the Great Depression that still eludes 99.99999% of economists. So bad were things from 1993-96 at Nvidia that Valley graphics expert David Kirk made his contract employment there contingent on receiving a paper check every week. Stock options were not an option. Amid all this, including another failed chip, the sign went up at headquarters about how “our company is thirty days from going out of business.” Recessions signal recovery since recessions are when errors are fixed. Huang and Nvidia’s troubled times of old are useful as a way of exposing some of the many fallacies that inform “economics.” For one, there’s a view that won’t die among economics types that the Fed funds rate is the cost of credit. Oh please. There wasn’t a number high enough in the mid-1990s to properly compensate a lender to Nvidia. Except that it wasn’t just that the loan market was shut to Nvidia. Equity finance was a non-starter too as evidenced by Kirk’s demand for actual paper checks over stock options. It all asks readers to contemplate again why Huang is so rich today. It’s so easy to say that he’s that way because he’s a co-founder of Nvidia, but that’s the point. It’s too easy. The better explanation is that few initially wanted Nvidia’s shares. There’s quite simply no such thing as “easy money,” but since there isn’t, Huang almost certainly has more shares than he otherwise would. But that only tells part of the story. In January of 1999 Nvidia went public, but consider the year: 1999. When did you, the reader, first hear of Nvidia? If you own shares, when did you buy them? It’s worth asking mainly because of those who owned Nvidia shares in 1999, it’s no wild speculation that most don’t own those same shares today. It would have been too gut-wrenching for the average bear. Witt reports between the summer of 2001 and the fall of 2002, Nvidia shares lost 90 percent of their value. While Nvidia became part of the S&P 500 after replacing Enron in 2001, and while Huang was briefly a billionaire that same year, Witt notes that Nvidia’s shares didn’t just decline 90%, but that “It would fourteen years before he [Huang] saw that much money again.” To have kept faith in Nvidia on the way to enjoying enormous upside, the typical shareholder would have held on through some rough times, including 2006 when Nvidia’s shares dropped 90 percent once again. Witt quotes one tech pundit as writing amid the 2006 collapse that “For a long time, we have wondered when Nvidia’s abject stupidity would have a price.” Stop and think about that. Or re-read it while thinking more about why Huang is so rich. He believed deeply when few did. It's a reminder that with extraordinary wealth that spurs so much inequality handwringing, it’s perhaps better to think about the unseen. This is particularly useful with Nvidia since Huang, though known to have a “terrifying” temper, was also loathe to fire employees. He yelled them into line with his “cathartic” rants that he was very public about. Ok, but how many left after a tirade, or another dip in Nvidia shares, or because a “better” company like Intel offered them a job. How many individuals walked away from billion-dollar fortunes? One long-time Nvidia employee, Dwight Dierks, sold some shares right after the float in 1999 to buy his father a car. When he describes it as a “billion-dollar-Cadillac” in joking fashion, there’s serious reality underlying the joke. Since going public in 1999, Nvidia shares are up 300,000%. Which is the point, but perhaps not the expected point. It’s so easy to say how foolish it was for early Nvidia employees to leave, or for co-founder Curtis Priem to sell all of his founders shares for hundreds of millions from 2004-2006 when they would be worth $100 billion+ today, but as evidenced by how much departed employees and founders like Priem could have made, Huang pulled off the miracle of miracles. There’s no other way to explain the would have, could have been fortunes. Naturally individuals sold, quit, left, came back, left again, and all sorts of actions unrelated to amassing shares that, by virtue of their miraculous climb, were never supposed to climb this high. In Huang’s case, and amid the occasional costly stumble rooted in his relentless investment “in speculative technologies that would either revolutionize computing or flop,” the future was far from certain. Exactly because any successful chip was immediately a target for imitation, Huang had to keep seeing ahead. In his own words, “If we don’t reinvent computer graphics, if we don’t reinvent ourselves, and we don’t open the canvas for the things we can do,” we “will be commoditized out of business.” Imagine the pressure of having to constantly see around the proverbial corner, while knowing full well the brutal market reaction that awaits after the inevitable mistake. It all speaks to the entrepreneurial mind. And this includes people like Elizabeth Holmes who tragically sit in jail for believing so deeply in her vision. Never asked by Holmes’s myriad critics is why, assuming she knew she was committing fraud, she never sold any of her shares. There was a huge and very liquid market for private shares, yet Holmes held on to hers. It’s that state of mind thing again. It’s why the unequal are unequal. Huang held on, and did so through incredibly difficult stretches that included him fighting to keep his job. The unequal believe in themselves, and they don’t lose faith as others are expressing their lack of faith through share sales. Again, much more interesting than the billionaires minted by Nvidia would be those that weren’t because they sold, exited, or both too soon. Which was once again logical. Witt is clear that earnings represented to Huang the chance to try something new. Rather than pivot toward the obvious, Huang was routinely searching for the “zero-billion-dollar market,” as in the market that’s not yet there. Is it any wonder that truly entrepreneurial visions are rejected by nearly everyone, and most notably the existing commercial successes? Writing about Huang, Witt indicates that he seemed to find comfort in markets “that only he would participate in – one that only he would even see.” Huang indicates to this day that Intel isn’t nor was it ever a competitor. Nvidia was yet again in search of the "zero-billion-dollar” markets that Intel wasn’t interested in, but that Huang was. And is. He saw things and sees things. Very interesting in consideration of Nvidia’s wild ride was the talent that Huang lured into the fold. Keep in mind that this is Silicon Valley, which means the most ferocious battle of all is the ongoing one for talent. Yet despite Nvidia’s scary ups and downs on the way to arguably the world’s most important company, “Nvidia employees were unabashedly elitist.” It was a known that Nvidia was full of talent, which says so much about Huang. With sharks all around him trying to poach the most crucial capital of all, Huang managed to maintain a very deep bench. Terrifying as he could be, Witt notes that almost all of existing and former Nvidia employees interviewed by him “had a tender story about Huang to relate.” What fun it would be to follow him around for a day, or days. And not just Huang. A company this dynamic is logically dense with characters. There’s Bill Dally, who dropped out of high school given an aversion to sitting through history class, became an auto mechanic, but ultimately got a BA at Virginia Tech, a Masters from Stanford, and a PhD from MIT. Dally had options, including Intel, and was told he was “crazy” for not taking an Intel job that surely more than a few Nvidians (?) did. There was John Nickolls who always yelled instead of talking. Witt notes that Nickolls “had no interest in video games at all,” but was passionate about proving Moore’s Law wrong. He did. Nvidia did. Cancer ultimately took Nickolls way too early, but to read about him was to want to ask him (or others in the Nvidia orbit) if he felt the mechanization of knowledge and thought might eventually save him from the cancer that existing medicine couldn’t. Alex Krizhevsky didn’t work for Nvidia, but he trained neural nets to see and think. By his actions, this soft-spoken Ukrainian immigrant conveyed to all manner of academics that (per Witt) “they had so far wasted their careers” on beliefs that Krizhevsky discredited with a week’s worth of “training,” and enormous amounts of electricity used in the training. Krizshevsky oversaw a giant leap, one indicating that “if you could teach computers to see, you could teach them everything.” Of course, in writing what was just written it’s almost certain that all sorts of things were mangled in the telling. But that’s surely the point. And it’s why the AI advances elicit so much optimism in your reviewer. AI isn’t a threat to humanity, rather it will elevate humankind in ways too grand to describe. Is there a way to say how it will reveal its genius? Certainly not. If there was a way to know what’s ahead, then those who know would be billionaires for knowing. All we know, or should know, is that it will be brilliant. Think of the pin factory Adam Smith entered in the 18th century. One man working alone could maybe produce one pin per day, but several men working together could produce tens of thousands. Multiply the latter hundreds of thousands of times over with AI as technology thinks and does as though thousands and millions of brilliantly skilled individuals are at work. Oh, to be born today. Or fifty years from now. Surprisingly, Witt expresses fear throughout the book that AI could have evil qualities, but in the words of Huang, “In order to be a creature, you have to be conscious.” AI will lift humans to the best versions of themselves precisely because it will enable specialization that will have more and more of us working all the time not because we have to, but because we want to. In a very real sense, the AI that has been authored by the remarkable chips created by Nvidia will turn the world’s workers into Nvidia’s workers. Which will be a beautiful sight to see. Impossibly rich as Nvidia employees are, they’re still coming to work. They can’t not. They work all the time because they love what they’re doing, and they’re in love with discovery. It cannot be stressed enough that progress in life is defined not by what we’re doing and learning, but by what we no longer need to do and learn. That’s why Huang is so right that AI “can only lead to good.” It’s so true. About halfway through The Thinking Machine, Witt quotes AI visionary (and oddly enough, skeptic) Geoffrey Hinton talking about “the uncontainable thrill of sneak previewing embargoed AI technology that would shock the world once unveiled.” Yes! Once again, to be young. There’s no limit to human advance, particularly as production is spread across a soaring number of hands, machines, and thought that’s mechanized. Read Stephen Witt’s book to get a sense of what’s ahead as wealth inequality soars thanks to human flourishing going skyward, but almost as fun, sit back and watch. We haven’t seen this movie before, but it will make all that we’ve seen before seem incredibly bland by comparison.

This blog is a monster 25 pages. Hence the executive summary Transformation seldom starts at the core of an existing market or business, but rather starts in edge use cases of unmet needs and price performance (ie, Innovators Dilemma). Edge UCs may be the biggest economic opportunity for Agentic, organizing hyperlocal, DTC and the food chain to create a new kind of market. If these edge UCs can be addressed in the US, it also greatly expands the global market opportunity as small regional needs resemble the edge. The consumer benefit of this approach is an awareness of the very different “purpose” of agentic platforms vs Amazon or Walmart. Imagine identifying which businesses and service providers could address your needs locally. 1. Strategic Focus on Edge Markets: The primary economic opportunity for Agentic Commerce lies in “edge” use cases (Direct-to-Consumer, hyperlocal, custom goods, circular economy) rather than direct competition with retail giants. These peripheral markets have significant unmet needs and fewer incumbent barriers. 2. Innovator’s Dilemma Application: This approach aligns with the Innovator’s Dilemma, where transformative technologies often incubate in niche areas before disrupting core markets. 3. Core Economic Activity is Market Creation: In these initial stages, the fundamental role of agentic AI is to enable new types of transactions and organize currently inefficient or fragmented markets, effectively creating new economic ecosystems. 4. Key US Edge Segments Identified: 5. Critical Challenges for Platform Operators: 6. Greater Need, Greater Opportunity: Unstructured edge markets have a more profound need for AI-driven orchestration. The significant effort required to build these markets creates substantial and defensible value for successful platform operators. 7. Global Blueprint Potential: Success in organizing US hyperlocal markets can provide a model for expansion into emerging economies (e.g., Africa, LATAM), which often feature similar fragmentation and mobile-first environments. 8. Conclusion: Agentic commerce’s path to scale involves solving complex problems in underserved markets. The “hard work” of market creation in these areas will lead to significant, defensible economic opportunities and a foundation for global impact. Clayton Christensen’s seminal work, “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” provides a compelling framework for understanding existing businesses optimize for serving their existing customer base. They often overlook or dismiss disruptive technologies in niche markets or cater to overlooked customer segments. Competitors attack from below here, addressing unmet needs where current solutions are inadequate, overly complex, or prohibitively expensive. The “unmet need” in these peripheral markets frequently extends beyond the mere provision of a product; it often includes discovery, service, and trust within fragmented and inefficient markets. For instance, the challenge in hyperlocal supply chains is not necessarily a lack of local produce, but the absence of an efficient system to connect producers with consumers at scale (ie farmers’ markets don’t scale). Agentic AI’s capability to orchestrate is not just task execution but comprehensive market orchestration. The “price performance” advantage offered by agentic AI in these scenarios may initially develop not as better price, but rather in lower overall transaction costs (such as search, negotiation, and coordination efforts) across markets with little structure (ie complex, customized, or difficult-to-source goods and services). This price-performance dimension can also be realized through hyper-personalization at scale, a superior value proposition that incumbent players cannot easily replicate. This form of “performance” is redefined as “fit-for-purpose,” where agentic AI excels. New technological innovations are frequently first adopted by established market players to bolster their competitive positions within existing market frameworks. Consequently, Perplexity or other agentic aggregators aggregating demand will encounter substantial resistance. Current stakeholders, including retailers and distributors, actively work to protect their established market shares and customer relationships. As I outlined previously, CMOs today express apprehension regarding the emergence of “another Google”. By initiating operations in edge markets agentic commerce platforms can minimize direct confrontation with entrenched players. This strategy allows the new platform to cultivate its own network effects and refine its value proposition before potentially challenging more fortified market positions. This story illustrates how deeply ingrained relationships, brand value, and expectations shape incumbent behavior and their perception of value. We all know Fortune 500 firms suffer from “organizational inertia,” and fined it difficult to pivot when new technologies emerge that threaten their core business models. Edge markets, by their nature, possess fewer entrenched systems and practices. In these peripheral markets, agentic platforms can strategically reframe their role. Instead of being perceived as disintermediators of strong, existing players, they can position themselves as enablers for underserved small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and individual producers. This strategy should fosters collaboration rather than immediate conflict. For a local artisan, a custom furniture maker, or a hyperlocal farmer struggling with market access and visibility, an agentic platform can offer an invaluable route to market that is currently unavailable. The platform thus becomes an ally, empowering these smaller entities to reach new customers or compete more effectively, rather than posing a direct threat to an established intermediary. This dynamic fundamentally alters the challenge of network building from one of confrontation to one of mutual benefit. IMHO the initial opportunity for agentic commerce lies in the vast, often unorganized, “everything else” economy. These are markets characterized by fragmentation, specificity, and unmet needs that fall outside the purview of mass-market retail. AI-driven agents are uniquely positioned to bring structure, efficiency, and new value to these segments. Today, where do you search for hyperlocal or DTC? The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) model represents one of the most rapidly expanding segments in the retail landscape, with brands connecting with their end customers. This “milk man” approach has found significant traction in e-commerce (ex Warby Parker and Dollar Shave Club), and holds potential in hyperlocal contexts, including fresh produce, bakery items, dairy products, and the inventory of local stores. Projections indicate DTC e-commerce sales in the US were expected to reach $161.22 billion by 2024, underscoring a persistent shift towards direct selling. Further growth is anticipated, with social commerce, a key enabler for DTC, projected to generate over $100 billion in revenue in 2025, a 22% increase from 2024. Agentic commerce can provide structure for DTC by automating and optimizing numerous the DTC journey. This includes highly personalized product discovery and demand generation (distinct from traditional advertising), streamlined order management, and responsive customer service. Such capabilities can significantly lower the barrier to entry for brands to adopt and scale DTC more effectively. Today the challenge often extends beyond merely selling directly; it encompasses managing the entire customer lifecycle and the operational complexities that retailers traditionally handle. Agentic AI can function as an “outsourced operational backbone,” assisting with tasks like autonomous product catalog management, where agents monitor supplier feeds and sales data to keep offerings fresh, and delivering hyper-personalized shopping experiences. This support can empower a new wave of “micro-DTC” brands, particularly for niche and artisanal producers who currently lack the scale, technical expertise, or operational capacity to manage direct selling operations effectively. By radically simplifying the creation and management of these operations, agentic platforms can unlock a vast, currently inaccessible supply from the long tail of producers. Hyperlocal supply chains, particularly for perishable goods such as locally sourced grains, fresh produce, and meats, are frequently characterized by disorganization and inefficiency. Traditional models like farmers’ markets, while valuable for community engagement, lack the scalability and structured to meet broader demand. The global online food delivery market, a significant component of hyperlocal commerce, was projected to see revenues grow from $156.75 billion in 2024 to $173.57 billion in 2025.10 The US food subscription market alone was valued at $150.3 billion in 2024, with a forecasted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% from 2025 to 2032.1 The broader gig economy, which encompasses a wide array of local services, was valued globally at $455 billion in 2025, with the US market segment estimated at $556.7 billion in 2024 and projected to grow to $646.77 billion in 2025, exhibiting a CAGR of 16.18%. These figures underscore the opportunity. A platform capable of aggregating local supply or real-time inventory could focus on enabling consumers to buy locally and orchestrate both the purchase process and the logistics of local delivery. This unmet need extends beyond tangible goods to encompass local services from home maintenance to personal wellness. The hyperlocal market opportunity lies in significantly reducing spoilage and waste, particularly for perishable items, and increasing asset utilization for small service providers. This is achieved through demand forecasting, efficient inventory management, and optimized logistical coordination, all powered by AI. For small local businesses, unsold inventory or unbooked service appointments represent direct losses. AI’s capacity to aggregate demand, predict consumer needs, and streamline fulfillment directly addresses these inefficiencies, converting potential waste into revenue. A hyperlocal agentic platform could catalyze the formation of new “micro-economies.” or at least Micro Markets. By lowering the barriers to entry for supplying goods or services at a local level. This impact transcends mere efficiency gains for existing businesses; it fosters an expansion of the participatory base in local commerce, potentially enhancing local employment and the global economy (see Payments and Expanding the Global Economy). The demand for custom-made products, such as a specialized racing go-kart or a minivan modified for accessibility, and curated experiences frequently involves intricate processes of requirement gathering, iterative design, and the coordination of multiple suppliers or services. The global personalized gifts market serves as a strong proxy for this demand, projected to grow from $31.05 billion in 2025 to $43.5 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 8.8%.20 Another estimate suggests a $10.76 billion expansion in this market between 2025 and 2029, at a CAGR of 6.7%.21 North America is a significant driver, accounting for 29% of this market and anticipated to be the fastest-growing region.20 Agentic AI can function as a sophisticated project manager or an intelligent personal shopper in this domain. These AI agents can understand nuanced user needs expressed in natural language, source appropriate components or services, facilitate complex design processes, and manage the end-to-end creation and delivery of bespoke products. This includes AI-driven personalization at scale for items that require substantial user input or co-creation, effectively translating vague consumer desires into concrete product specifications and managing multi-step production or assembly workflows. Platforms like “Daydream” allow users to ‘chat to shop’ for fashion using natural language prompts, receiving tailored suggestions rather than infinite options. The role of the agent in the custom goods sector extends beyond simple matching to active co-creation and intricate problem-solving. This is particularly true for items that are not COTS and require a deep understanding design trade-offs, specialized components or modifications. AI stylists, for example, can curate entire outfits rather than just suggesting single items, and AI can facilitate hyper-personalized designs based on user descriptions. In this vein, customization can transition from a luxury niche to a more mainstream offering. A shift that could unlock significant latent demand from consumers who desire personalized products but are currently deterred by the cost or complexity of the customization process. The market for used goods is experiencing rapid expansion, fueled by a combination of economic pressures compelling consumers to seek value and a growing societal emphasis on sustainability. The global resale market was valued at approximately $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to potentially double to $400 billion by 2027. Another analysis indicates the global second-hand products market stood at $186 billion in 2024 and is forecasted to surge to $1.044 trillion by 2035, reflecting a robust CAGR of 17.2% between 2025 and 2035. North America holds 40% share. Agentic AI can significantly enhance marketplaces by improving the listing process through AI-generated descriptions and pricing suggestions derived from minimal inputs like a single photograph, facilitating more efficient discovery of specific items, aiding in the verification of authenticity or condition, and managing the intricacies of transactions or loan agreements. These functions directly address the inherent fragmentation, information asymmetry, and trust deficits prevalent in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-to-consumer (B2C) used goods markets. Many consumers retain items they no longer need and refrain from selling due to the hassle of listing, pricing, shipping, or managing the exchange. By dramatically lowering the friction for suppliers platforms could bring millions of new items into circulation. This represents an expansion of the total addressable market of tradable used goods. Platforms that cover this market also creates a distinction from Amazon, as they engage for a purpose. If the purpose is local, or used its ebay, craigslist or the AI platform. Table 1: Key US Edge Market Segments for Agentic Commerce Market Segment Estimated US Market Size/Growth (or Global Proxy) Core Unmet Need Key Agentic AI Opportunity Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) US DTC eCom: $161.22B by 2024.6 Social Commerce (global): >$100B in 2025 (+22% YoY).7 Brands seek direct customer relationships & control; consumers want authentic brand experiences.

AI-automated listing/appraisal, enhanced discovery, condition verification, management of loan agreements, unlocking “dormant” inventory. 22 While edge opportunities are substantial, realizing them requires agentic platform operators to undertake significant operational and strategic work. For instance, aggregating and structuring a highly fragmented supply side, orchestrating a seamless and trustworthy end-to-end customer experience, and defining the governance (ex. return policy). A primary hurdle for agentic commerce platforms aiming to serve edge markets is the effective aggregation and organization of supply from a vast, diverse, and often technologically unsophisticated base of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and individual providers. To construct a functional marketplace, a structured and comprehensive catalog detailing what these myriad small businesses can offer, encompassing products, services, and real-time inventory availability. This necessitates the creation of robust schemas and data structures capable. Edge SMBs often lack people, and standardized for their own business. Or other specialist agents that can go through SMB purchase lists or online product listings. The task of onboarding and continuously updating data from millions of disparate SMBs is formidable and represents a usability and incentive challenge for The solution may lie in AI-driven data ingestion and structuring that minimizes the burden on the SMB, perhaps using Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert unstructured text into structured data attributes, or employing computer vision to extract product features from images. Incentives, such as immediate access to aggregated demand or premium visibility, will be crucial to encourage SMB participation and data sharing. Such a dataset would itself be a competitive barrier. My analogy is Alipay and Taobao as every small business is present in a single giant consumer market. For many critical edge use cases, such as hyperlocal food delivery, local retail inventory access, and the exchange of used goods, real-time inventory data is key for customer experience and fulfillment. Given that SMBs lack sophisticated inventory management systems, Agentic platforms must furnish simple, intuitive tools or seamless integrations that empower SMBs to publish and update their inventory status with minimal effort. In a previous blog, I outlined how all small businesses publish their real time store inventory to Google. Why? Because when you search on outdoor furniture Google local shows “in stock at Crate and Barrell” with measurement to show conversions. Data sharing equals sales, this is the model that Agentic platforms must create. The challenge is not just publishing inventory data; it involves maintaining its accuracy with minimal ongoing effort. Agentic AI systems could address this by learning sales velocities for specific items and proactively prompting updates (e.g., “It appears you may be running low on Product X. Do you still have 5 units in stock?”). Or perhaps integration with Block’s POS to automatically update inventory upon a sale. If accomplished, and aggregator’s visibility across a distributed network of local SMBs could also unlock novel and highly efficient fulfillment models. For instance, an AI agent could orchestrate “hyperlocal Clicks-to-Bricks” fulfillment, where it locates an item at the nearest small store with confirmed availability and arranges for immediate customer pickup or rapid local delivery. Transforming isolated SMBs into a market of interconnected nodes within a dynamic, responsive local supply network, orchestrated by the agentic platform. Beyond supply-side aggregation, agentic platforms face the equally daunting task of managing the entire customer journey, from initial discovery through to fulfillment and post-purchase support. This is particularly complex in decentralized markets populated by numerous small, independent suppliers. Agentic platforms must be capable of guiding users from engagement through the discovery of unique or highly specific items and services, to the delivery and navigate post-purchase scenarios such as returns, exchanges, or complaints. This end-to-end orchestration is challenging within a single domain and even more so in decentralized market with no governance. AI agents will need to coordinate complex logistics, potentially integrating with third-party delivery providers, manage customer expectations regarding timelines and quality, and ensure consistent service levels across a diverse supplier base. AI must also articulate the risk. Who owns it? Can I return my goods? The “orchestration” challenge implies the necessity for AI agents to collaborate with other specialized AI agents or automated systems, such as logistics APIs, payment gateways, customer service chatbots, and inventory management modules. Multi-agent system architectures enable agent specialization within a segment and geography. While product discovery can be approximated by advanced search engines and payment processing is a relatively commoditized function, coordination represents a significantly harder problem to solve at scale. Mastering this orchestration for the “everything else” economy would create unique value, defensible not merely through network effects but through profound operational and AI-driven sophistication. Ensuring consistent product quality, reliable service delivery, and the effective management of exceptions like returns or disputes presents a major hurdle. Unlike integrated retailers such as Walmart, which explicitly stand behind every purchase and manage the associated risks, a decentralized agentic marketplace requires robust mechanisms to build and maintain trust when the platform operator neither owns the inventory nor directly controls the service provision. AI-driven solutions for supplier vetting, ongoing performance monitoring, dynamic reputation systems, secure escrow services, and transparent, integrated dispute resolution processes. Consumer trust in AI agents and the platforms they operate on will depend heavily on the existence of such assurance frameworks and clear recourse mechanisms. Replicating the “Walmart trust factor” in a decentralized market requires platforms to evolve their governance into a trusted guarantor or mediator, even if it does not directly supply the goods or services. For example, AI can analyze supplier reviews, disputes, or historical performance data. As I related, Visa and Mastercard are best placed to define the governance structure of agentic operation across all platforms (a significant 5yr VAS opportunity). The Platform (or V/MA) becomes an enforcer of quality standards and a cornerstone of market trust. The data generated from managing quality, resolving disputes, and tracking supplier performance across a vast network of edge transactions can, in turn, be used to create highly accurate, dynamic “trust scores” for suppliers. These scores, far more nuanced than simple star ratings, become a valuable asset for the platform, a reliable signal for consumers, and a powerful incentive for suppliers to maintain high standards of conduct and service quality. Agentic platforms must not only connect buyers and sellers but also establish the fundamental rules and mechanisms that govern their interactions, particularly concerning pricing, risk allocation, and the overall framework of trust. For the non-commodity goods and services pricing is often not a fixed affair. It can involve dynamic mechanisms such as auctions, formal Request for Proposal (RFP) processes, or bespoke, bilateral negotiations. The Michelin-Ford tire example, where an RFP that failed to specify “brand” led to an initial supply of unbranded tires, underscores the complexity of value assessment beyond simple price points in such transactions. Agentic AI platforms must be architected to support these complex pricing mechanisms. This could involve AI agents capable of participating in, or even autonomously conducting, negotiations on behalf of buyers or sellers as agents take into account factors beyond price: product quality, delivery timelines, supplier reputation, warranty terms, and other non-monetary aspects of a deal. Platforms like Keelvar demonstrate agentic AI autonomously designing and managing sourcing events, while Pactum shows AI agents engaging in autonomous supplier dialogue and agreement finalization. Dynamic, multi-attribute negotiations at scale is an upmarket that could be made available and usable by SMBs. This could lead to more efficient market clearing for unique items and services, where value is assessed holistically rather than on price alone. Sophisticated AI negotiating agents also raises the prospect of new forms of complex market dynamics, including the potential for “algorithmic collusion,” where AI agents, even without explicit programming to do so, learn pricing strategies that lead to supra-competitive outcomes. Such developments would necessitate new regulatory frameworks and oversight mechanisms to ensure market fairness, particularly in markets for unique or essential custom goods and services. As highlighted previously, established retailers like Walmart cultivate consumer trust by explicitly backing every purchase and providing clear avenues for recourse. In a decentralized agentic marketplace, defining who bears responsibility for fulfillment, ensuring product or service quality, and impartially handling disputes is a critical and complex challenge. To compete, platforms must establish market rules leverage AI for comprehensive risk assessment of transactions and suppliers, advanced fraud detection, this is also an area where V/MA can lead as well as facilitation of an efficient dispute resolution processes Examples includ implementing platform-backed guarantees, secure escrow services managed via smart contracts, or specialized insurance mechanisms tailored for agent-mediated commerce. The development of “Agent Passports” or similar identity verification systems for AI agents can also contribute to building trust and accountability within these ecosystems. For end to end assurance a qualification of every participating agent and entity is necessary. This is the “market”.

While the initial investment in terms of effort and resources to establish these markets is more substantial, the potential upside for a successful market maker aligns to their market valuations. Edge markets offer what is effectively a “greenfield” opportunity. Here, new entrants can define the rules of engagement, build powerful network effects from the ground up, and capture significant economic value by bringing order and efficiency to previously chaotic or underserved segments of economic activity. In such contexts, the role of AI transcends incremental improvement, as might be seen in core retail applications, to become one of fundamental enablement and market creation. The “greater need for AI orchestration” within these unstructured markets signifies that AI itself becomes a core, indispensable component of market creation, customer experience and the overall value proposition, not merely an ancillary optimization tool. Platforms that undertake the “hard work” to organize this supply and demand capture a proportionally larger share of the value created in each transaction. This is not a “new kind of search” that competes with Google and Amazon. It is not even eCommerce in the traditional sense. This is enabling a new market and way to coordinate it that only AI can deliver. By handling complex discovery, nuanced negotiation, intricate customization processes, and multi-party logistics coordination, the AI’s contribution to the final transaction value is substantially higher. This justifies a more significant revenue share for the platform that provides this essential orchestration layer. The process of successfully organizing one complex edge market using agentic AI can lead to the development of a reusable “playbook.” This playbook, comprising refined AI models, standardized data schemas, proven trust mechanisms, and effective orchestration logic, can significantly accelerate entry into other, similarly unstructured markets. The “hard operational work” undertaken to structure supply, build robust trust frameworks, and orchestrate fulfillment for, say, custom artisan goods, involves creating specific AI capabilities and market rules. This framework can be reused. Reuse creates powerful economies of scale and scope in the process of market-making itself, allowing the platform to achieve compounding competitive advantages as it expands its footprint across the “everything else” economy. Assuming an agentic US success in hyperlocal, the resultant models, technologies, and operational learnings can serve as a valuable blueprint for expansion into smaller, often mobile-first, markets in emerging economies, such as those found in Africa and Latin America. These markets frequently exhibit highly fragmented local economies, a significant presence of informal sector activities, and a greater dependency on mobile platforms for commerce and communication. These characteristics make them potentially fertile ground for agentic commerce solutions tailored to organize local supply chains—for example, in agriculture, local retail, or the production of artisan goods—and connect them efficiently to existing and new sources of demand.19 This approach would mirror the successes in US hyperlocal markets but would be carefully adapted to the unique socio-economic, cultural, and technological contexts of these regions. The global agentic commerce market, including solutions across retail, payments, and customer service, was estimated between $5-6.7 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $10.41 billion by the end of 2025, with forecasts suggesting it could touch $41-200 billion between 2030 and 2040, indicating substantial global growth potential.76 The potential for “leapfrogging” is particularly pronounced in many emerging markets. Analogous to how mobile telephony bypassed the extensive rollout of landline infrastructure in many developing nations, agentic commerce platforms—optimized for mobile-first interaction and adept at navigating the nuances of fragmented and informal economies—could circumvent the need for the development of traditional, Western-style retail infrastructure. Many emerging markets lack the highly organized retail chains, sophisticated logistics networks, and formalized business structures prevalent in the US.43 If agentic AI can effectively organize informal sellers, smallholder farmers, and local producers—who form the backbone of many economies in Africa and Latin America—and connect them to buyers primarily via mobile interfaces, it can catalyze a new paradigm of commerce that does not depend on massive prior investment in physical infrastructure.72 The deployment of agentic commerce in these emerging markets could also yield significant socio-economic benefits. By empowering small-scale entrepreneurs, local artisans, and agricultural producers with direct access to larger markets, transparent price discovery, efficient operational tools, and potentially integrated financial services (such as micro-payments or escrow facilities accessible via mobile), these platforms can substantially uplift local economies.75 This has the potential to foster more inclusive growth, improve livelihoods, and enhance the resilience of local communities. The trajectory for agentic commerce to achieve significant economic impact and widespread adoption does not lie in pursuing incremental improvements within already optimized, mature markets. Instead, its most profound potential resides in the ambitious endeavor of structuring, organizing, and efficiently serving the vast, underserved “everything else” economy. By strategically focusing on edge use cases characterized by clear unmet needs agentic platforms can sidestep direct confrontation with entrenched incumbents. This approach allows them to concurrently build valuable, defensible networks and cultivate sophisticated AI-driven orchestration capabilities. The sophisticated AI systems honed in these challenging environments, trained on diverse, real-world edge case data and refined through continuous interaction, will establish insurmountable competitive barriers. The established supplier relationships, the nuanced pricing and risk algorithms, and the innovative trust mechanisms will collectively constitute a powerful strategic asset. Ultimately, the economic opportunity extends beyond immediate transactional revenues; it encompasses the creation and ownership of new market infrastructures. The robust capabilities forged in addressing the complexities of US-based edge markets will provide a solid and adaptable foundation for strategic expansion into emerging economies, where the need for such organizational and efficiency-enhancing technologies is often even more acute. By making the long tail of supply accessible, manageable, and efficient, agentic commerce is poised to reshape the contours of commerce on a global scale, unlocking new avenues of value creation for businesses and consumers alike. “ decentralized agentic marketplace requires robust mechanisms to build and maintain trust” You are so right about this Tom. The shift to Agentic is a shift toward the reputation economy. There is no doubt in my mind that new cryptographic techniques – many of them developed for the cryptocurrency world – mean that this now viable without centralised gatekeepers.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Young businessman working on laptop at home. Most mainstream financial websites are not “smart enough” to include special dividends. The yields they display reflect plain ol’ quarterly or monthly payouts. For most stocks this does not matter. But for a select few “special payers” this is a costly oversight. One that we can capitalize on as thoughtful contrarians. In a moment we’ll discuss five special dividends. The vanilla screens say they pay as little as 3.2% but in reality they dish up to 13.8%! What exactly is a special dividend payment? It is a one-time cash payout, often the result of a massive cash influx from, say, selling off part of the company or having an unusually profitable year. Usually it is a one-shot deal. But it can be a regular thing. Let’s consider chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC), which recently paid a $6.30 per share special dividend. This is a tremendous 12.7% yield. That’s amazing for people who held PPC at the time, but given the company’s dividend history, it’s likely this is it: PPC Dividend PPC is a classic example of a one-time payer. We are looking for exceptions—the one-time payment that happens every year! These are “regular” special dividends, sometimes called “supplemental dividends,” that the company pairs with a regular dividend they know they can afford. Example: ABC Inc. pays 25 cents per share quarterly, but at the end of the year, it pays out 50% of its free cash flow as a supplemental dividend. That dividend still might vary—say, $1 in 2023, $1.50 in 2024, and $1.25 in 2025—but it’s extra yield on top of what it can afford to pay on the regular. In some cases, these special dividend payers can be quite generous. Let’s take these 3.2%-11.3% yielders that actually pay out 9.0%-13.8% once we include their special distributions: Buckle (BKE)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.2%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.0% Buckle (BKE) is a mid- to high-end fashion retailer that’s primarily known for its jeans, but it also sells all sorts of apparel, activewear, swimwear and accessories. Fashion stocks have always been fickle, but post-COVID, they’ve been downright counterintuitive. Numerous “mall retail” stocks found themselves slowly declining in the years preceding the pandemic, only to find new life despite COVID broadly knocking brick-and-mortar retail on its tail. That includes the Buckle, whose top and bottom lines have dipped from their post-COVID highs but are still far better than what the store delivered for years prior to the pandemic. Looking at its regular dividend over the past decade or so, the difference is hard to notice—a couple of small raises in 2021, but that’s it. However, that’s because Buckle’s dividend has long been unlike its fashion retail brethren. The company prefers to pay a modest regular quarterly dividend, then top it up each year with sometimes spectacular special dividends that boost BKE’s yield by double, triple, sometimes even more. Naturally, the rub is that, by virtue of offering massive special dividends, the amount of income we collect from Buckle has the potential to shift enormously from one year to the next—even if the specials have been fairly consistent of late, and even if operational results are largely expected to remain steady over the next couple of years. Even the potential for income volatility isn’t great for retirement planners, but for more adventurous investors, it’s a secret store of upside that most people will typically overlook. Amerisafe (AMSF)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.7% Amerisafe (AMSF) is a relatively unusual insurer that deals in workers’ compensation. The company operates in 27 states and deals in “high-hazard” industries such as construction, trucking and agriculture. Anyone who wants to invest in an industry with consistent profits should sprint away from the insurance space. AMSF is actually relatively stable compared to, say, P&C insurance, where even good operators may occasionally suffer annual losses. But even then, Amerisafe’s bottom line is a moving target. Which makes a regular-and-specials program an extremely responsible way to manage the dividend. AMSF pays a modest (but growing!) quarterly dividend that typically yields around 3%. Then every year, usually in December, it will pay a special dividend with whatever profits it can spare. Like with Buckle, this payout usually doubles or triples the amount of income its shareholders collect in a given year. Again, retirees can’t plan their budgets around dividends like Amerisafe’s. But consider this: AMSF’s 2024 special dividend was the company’s lowest in roughly a decade, and it still boosted the stock’s total yield to nearly 10%. With that level of dividend, we don’t need much positive price action to have a great annual return. I’d keep an eye on that bottom line, though. AMSF’s profits, which have already slid for a couple years now, are projected to thin this year and next, too. One area of the market that’s rife with “regular” special dividends is the business development company (BDC) community. These companies share a lot in common with real estate investment trusts (REITs): they were both created by Congress, they both exist to allow regular investors to invest in an otherwise difficult-to-reach asset, and they both are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends. But BDCs invest in dozens if not hundreds of small businesses: not exactly a hotbed of stability and reliability. So in the BDC space, we’ll frequently see fairly generous regular dividends complemented with specials that take already good yields and make them downright great. Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN)Stated Dividend Yield: 6.4%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 14.3% Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN) is part of my favorite Wall Street family: the Gladstones! This group of businesses also includes another publicly traded BDC, Gladstone Capital Corp. (GLAD), as well as a pair of publicly traded REITs: Gladstone Land Corp. (LAND) and Gladstone Commercial Corp. (GOOD). GAIN’s target portfolio company will generate $4 million to $15 million in annual EBITDA, have a proven business model, stable cash flows and minimal market or technology risk. As far as BDCs go, GAIN has a narrower portfolio than most, at just 25 companies—mostly manufacturing, business services and consumer services firms, but a few consumer product specialists, too. What sticks out most about Gladstone Investment Corp., however, is its willingness to deal in equity. Most BDCs will typically only have 5% to 10% exposure to equity, but GAIN’s target mix is 25% equity/75% debt. This is essential to GAIN’s “buyout” strategy. Gladstone Investment typically provides most (if not all) of the debt capital along with a majority of the equity capital. Its debt investments allow it to pay out a still-high regular dividend, but then it also pays out (extremely variable) supplemental payouts when they realize gains on equity investments. To wit, GAIN’s regular monthly dividend accounts for 6% worth of yield, but a 54-cent special dividend to be paid in June and a 70-cent distribution last October work out to an additional 8.3% in yield! That said, Gladstone’s specials are all over the place. The company paid three in 2022 and five in 2023, but just one in 2024 and (so far) just one in 2025. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 13.8% Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL) is among a handful of other BDCs, such as Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) and Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD), that’s connected from a big-name asset manager with a sterling reputation. In this case, NCDL is tied to both fund manager Nuveen, as well as its parent TIAA. The fund’s external manager—Churchill, a Nuveen affiliate—invests the BDC in senior secured loans to private equity-owned middle market companies in the U.S. The $2.1 billion portfolio is 210 companies strong right now. The vast majority of holdings (91%) are first lien loans, though Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending also deals in second lien debt, subordinated loans and equity co-investment. This is a relatively young BDC that has only been in existence since 2018, and it just went public in 2024. I wrote plenty about the company in a September column, but here, I want to focus on the payout. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending has come out of the gate with a regular-and-specials format. The regular quarterly dividend has been set at 45 cents per share, and it has so far paid an additional 10-cent special in every quarter since its IPO. That’s a strong double-digit yield base with, at least for now, a meaningful 2.5 percentage points in special sweeteners. The special distributions were declared in connection with the IPO, and April’s 10-cent payout was the final dividend in that tranche. Indeed, NCDL’s streak might stop this summer—based on its previous activity, any special dividends to be paid in July likely would have been announced in April. If nothing else, investors should keep their eye on NCDL over the next few quarters to see whether these specials were a one-off event or something the BDC will come back to following strong financial results. Also, NCDL is young, so it’s difficult to tell where its “normal” valuation range will lie, but for now, the BDC is trading at an 11% discount to NAV. Barings BDC (BBDC)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 12.9% Barings BDC (BBDC) is the cheapest of these three BDCs, trading at an 18% discount to NAV right now. The Barings name might not mean much to some readers, but longtime BDC investors will surely remember the name “Triangle Capital.” That’s what the company was known as until August 2018, when the company rebranded following years of writing off bad investments and hacking away at its dividend. But it wasn’t just a rebrand—it was a new lease on life. Global financial services firm Barings became an external advisor and overhauled BBDC’s portfolio. Today, Barings primarily invests in senior secured private debt investments in “well-established” middle-market companies across numerous industries. Target companies for its sponsor-backed investments (issuers owned by private equity firms), the largest part of its business at 75%-85% exposure generally, generate between $15 million and $75 million in EBITDA annually. It also has smaller exposure to non-PE-owned businesses, as well as a pair of middle market first lien loan originators, Eclipse Business Capital and Rocade Capital. Meanwhile, about 70% of its investments are first lien loans, though it also has exposure to second lien, mezzanine, equity, structured, and joint venture investments. We’ve booked gains in BBDC twice through our Dividend Swing Trader service, so I frequently have my eye on this one for short- and long-term opportunities alike. So I was pleased to see when Barings made a splash in Q1. After a few years of dividend growth, the company’s quarterly dividend had been stuck at 26 cents per share since mid-2023. However, in February, Barings announced it would pay 5-cent special dividends across the first three quarters of 2025 “based on these strong results, our confidence in our portfolio, and the momentum we have seen so far in 2025.” While I’d prefer growth in the “stickier” regular dividend, this is a welcome development. The company hasn’t made “top-up” specials since 2014 and 2015. If BBDC makes this a lasting habit, its already stellar dividend will become even tastier. I’ll be keeping a close eye on the stock over the next couple of quarters to see if it extends this line of specials into the end of 2025 and into 2026.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Let’s start in August 2011, when debt-ceiling wrangling in Congress prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade US government debt. At the time, this move was historic: No agency had ever downgraded the US government’s credit, which was considered incredibly safe. What happened next? US long-term Treasuries (in blue below) surged some 20% from the day of the downgrade through the end of 2011. The S&P 500 (in orange) also had a good run, returning nearly 6% over those few months. ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Market Implications Of Tariff Litigation And AI Spending

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Despite what could be a lengthy legal battle, tariffs are unlikely to be removed completely. The ... More sectoral tariffs were not challenged and President Trump added additional steel tariffs on Friday. The tariff dispute does have some crucial implications for future trade deals and the tax bill. US economic data releases, which generally raised estimates of second-quarter economic growth, combined with strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), helped send stocks higher for the week. Additionally, improvement in consumer confidence helped raise optimism that the tariff overhang doesn’t need to sink the economy. A portion of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration was briefly overturned, though it was reinstated pending appeal. After the rally last week, the S&P 500 sits only 3.8% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 5.5% below its mid-December summit despite outperforming last week. Market Performance The betting odds of a recession in 2025 have continued to decline. This improvement aligns with the supportive economic data released last week, which increased the estimates of US second-quarter GDP growth. Furthermore, the Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence rose after plummeting in the wake of President Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day. Betting Odds Of US Recession In 2025 Notably, stocks hit their April low when betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, the S&P 500 index has risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Stocks & Recession Odds Nvidia did not disappoint investors with better-than-expected quarterly earnings and robust guidance for second-quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. Some worries that the spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure had weighed on the mega-cap technology companies, as represented by the Magnificent 7. In early April, the group was 30% below their mid-December peak. Most of this decline has reversed due to lower odds of recession. Additionally, the first-quarter earnings season provided evidence of both continued spending on AI infrastructure and, more importantly, proof that companies were successfully monetizing these AI investments into tangible earnings growth. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Last week, the Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down the majority of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The sectoral tariffs, for example, those on autos and steel, were not impacted by this ruling. The tariffs removed include the 10% universal tariff, the reciprocal tariffs, and the specific tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico. According to Strategas, this would remove about $220 billion in tariffs, leaving just $40 billion of those implemented since the start of the year. Within less than 24 hours after the ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay. Therefore, the tariffs will remain in place, and the US will not yet need to refund the tariff revenue collected to date. This litigation could be a lengthy process, but even if the tariffs are struck down at the end of the litigation, President Trump has the legal authority to reimpose tariffs via alternative methods. However, these methods come with some additional limitations. According to Strategas, Sections 338 and 122 of the Tariff Act of 1930 can be utilized quickly to reinstate many of the tariffs that are currently at risk. Section 338 allows for tariffs of up to 50% that take effect 30 days after announcement, with no time limit on their duration. Section 122 gives the president the authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% with immediate effect, but these tariffs can only remain in place for 150 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the imposition of tariffs following an investigation by the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It is doubtful that tariffs will go away unless President Trump decides that they are, but the utilization of other methods is more laborious, time-consuming, and comes with more limitations. Even though tariffs seem likely to remain a part of the investment landscape, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, there are some crucial implications of the additional uncertainty. On the margin, the possibility that the courts could remove the tariffs leaves the Trump administration with less leverage to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Countries may choose to stall and see what happens with the litigation. The G-7 meeting in June could provide some insight into whether any new deals are forthcoming. The tax bill passed by the US House of Representatives was debt-neutral if the revenue from the tariffs was included in the scoring. The risk to the tariff revenue may further complicate the Senate’s deliberations in passing a version of the bill. Markets will remain on the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and the progress of the legal challenge. Further, retaliation from or trade deals with other countries will be notable. The economic calendar has the critical monthly jobs report on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payroll job growth to slow to 125,000 from 177,000 in April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.2%. These forecasts are consistent with the weekly initial filings for unemployment benefits, which remain low and don’t indicate a collapse in the labor market. Initial Jobless Claims Ongoing claims for unemployment benefits are rising, indicating that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new employment. The labor market is showing signs of bending but not yet breaking. Continuing Claims Regardless of the outcome of the tariff litigation, tariffs are unlikely to be banished completely. To that point, President Trump imposed a 50% steel tariff late last Friday, and these sectoral tariffs are not part of the current legal challenge. Recent hard economic data, along with some soft data, such as consumer confidence, have raised optimism that US economic growth remains resilient. Furthermore, technology spending related to artificial intelligence continues, with the sector producing robust earnings growth. This week’s jobs report will be another key indicator of the US economy’s health.

Title: Walmart, Amazon, Costco, And Home Depot Tackle The Tariff Whiplash

ByShelley E. Kohan ByShelley E. Kohan, Senior Contributor. Coscto is focused on member pricing and plans to try and mitigate as much of the impact from tariffs ... More as it can for its customers. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The five largest retailers in the U.S -- Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot-- have all reported their financial earnings for the first part of 2025. The combined force of these retailers equates to nearly 20% of total retail sales in the United States. The big five retailers all agree that it is difficult to predict the future impact of tariffs, however, each retailer has been working on mitigating the impact of tariffs on pricing and product availability for its consumers. The impact of tariffs on financial reporting so far this year has been minimal because most of the earnings reported are from periods before the April 5th tariffs took effect. Home Depot and Walmart shared financials through the end of April, while Costco data goes through mid-May. Kroger, which operates over 20 store banners including Ralphs and Harris Teeter, reported financials through January. Amazon’s first quarter financials run through March. Walmart, Amazon,Costco and Home Depot have pulled forward their inventory purchases to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Purchasing inventory in advance will help ensure a company has product in stock down the line and can offer the best possible pricing. Amazon encouraged its third-party suppliers to do the same. Costco moved up the delivery for patio products and sporting goods to stay ahead of the tariff pricing impacts. While Walmart says it cannot absorb all the cost pressures from tariffs and may have to raise ... More prices, it wants to keep food prices as low as they can. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Even the U.S.’s largest retailers cannot take the sole burden of the tariffs by absorbing the costs without raising prices. Discount stores, grocery stores, ecommerce players, and warehouse clubs typically run on very thin profit margins. "We’re positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone. But even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," said Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart. The magnitude of the tariffs cannot be offset by lower-margin businesses. Home improvement giant Home Depot plans to maintain its competitive pricing despite tariff impacts through stronger supplier partnerships, supply chain diversification, and focusing on improving its productivity across activities. “We don’t see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward. It’s a great opportunity for us to take share, and it’s a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well,” said Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising at Home Depot. In the grocery sector, where food prices are 2.0% higher on a rolling 12-month basis, consumers are already having to spend more based on inflation. Companies like Walmart are trying to protect against additional costs due to tariffs on food products, considered a non-discretionary expense. “We won’t let tariff-related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices, " said McMillon. Food tariffs on countries in South and Central America are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and flowers. “We’ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible," said McMillon. Costco held pricing on pineapples and bananas despite the cost of these goods rising due to tariffs. However, when it came to flowers, which were also impacted by additional tariffs, the company felt that a price increase was absorbable by the consumer as flower purchases were viewed as a discretionary expense. Kroger, with 100% of its sales in the U.S., is looking at being proactive and diversifying its supplier base to keep prices lower, especially in the fresh produce category. "We expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2.5%, which does not include the effects from tariffs," said Todd Foley earlier in the year, interim CFO at Kroger. Amazon customers are becoming more reliant on the company for everyday essential products which ... More represented one out of every three units sold in the U.S. online at Amazon in the first quarter. Global retailers have been looking at diversifying sourcing options to reduce the cost of goods as tariffs are implemented. Amazon and Walmart have been diversifying their supply chains for many years, with a focus on not being too reliant on one country for imports. Two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the U.S. is made, assembled, or grown domestically. Walmart is further diversifying its revenue by leaning into better profit areas such as selling advertising through its retail media network, expanding its marketplace, and increasing membership income. Costco is rerouting goods to non-U.S. markets and working closely with suppliers to find alternate production locations. The private label brand, Kirkland Signature, which represents one-third of Costco’s sales, continues to be a consumer favorite in quality and value. The company has been sourcing the products into countries where items are sold to keep the pricing down. Costco’s most profitable sector, its membership revenue, is up 5.4%, with membership increasing to 137 million members last year despite a rise in its membership price. Home Depot has diversified its supply chain, with over 50% of purchases already sourced in the U.S. “We anticipate that twelve months from now, no single country outside of the United States will represent more than 10% of our purchases," said Ted Decker, CEO of Home Depot. Amazon is relentlessly focused on back-of-house infrastructure to improve delivery speeds and reduce costs by heavily investing in robotics and automation. The purchasing of everyday essentials continues to grow as a category for the consumer, making them more reliant on the Amazon brand and includes categories such as household goods, personal care items, and pantry staples. "We have an extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs (stock keeping units), which means we’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When you have the broadest selection like we do and 2,000,000 plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere," said Andy Jassy, CEO, Amazon. However, Costco’s narrow merchandise depth and broad assortment allow the company to focus on fewer SKUs, giving it a competitive advantage. "We believe our expertise in buying a limited SKU count model gives us greater agility to navigate the environment and ultimately increase our member values compared to the market," said Gary Millerchip, CFO at Costco. Home Depot will be looking at SKU optimization and possibly editing out some products that are significantly impacted by tariff costs but do not make sense to keep in its current assortment. Other retailers outside the big five have been working on optimizing the product styles that are most relevant to their customer base and eliminating the ones that are too costly or have lower turnover. As we move into the second quarter for most retailers (May through July), pricing may not be as impacted because retail buyers usually procure goods many months in advance of the selling season. However, going into fall and holiday selling, consumers may see price increases just in time for holiday purchasing. With imported items, the tariff is paid at the time it comes through customs, which means those products are most likely not in the U.S. yet. Retailers are unable to predict pricing for later in the year due to the uncertainty of where tariffs will land. There are too many assumptions and factors for retailers to chart a specific path forward during these highly unpredictable times in the retail landscape. The big five retailers continue to model various scenarios to help mitigate price increases or out-of-stocks for their customer base. The advantage with the larger multi-billion dollar retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot is the ability to leverage supplier networks and lean into the amount of resources available to help build out more sophisticated infrastructure to support a diversified supply network. The retailers are working hard to make sure prices stay in line with customer expectations, but it is too early within a volatile tariff landscape to predict the actual impact on pricing for consumers for the remainder of the year.

It’s a new month, and investors are heading into it amid fresh inflation data and rising pessimism that’s dominating headlines. With the Fed’s next meeting now just weeks away, all eyes will be on Friday’s jobs report, which could shape expectations for rate cuts this summer. At the same time, President Trump’s legal battles continue to reverberate throughout the market, just as a whopping 83% of of CEOs say they’re bracing for a downturn. Add in jobs data and earnings from a host of consumer names like Lululemon (LULU), MongoDB (MDB), HP (HPQ), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), and the first week of June looks unlikely to be lacking in storylines. Here’s what to watch: Campbell’s Company – parent of popular shelf staples including Prego and Goldfish – will release earnings before the market opens, with a conference call scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET. Analysts are expecting revenue of approximately $2.43 billion, reflecting 2% growth. On the macro side, at 10:00 a.m. ET, the U.S. Census Bureau will release the April 2025 Construction Spending report. This data provides insights into the health of the construction sector, which can influence economic growth projections and decision-making in closely related industries from real estate to manufacturing. Tuesday brings a greater mix of significant earnings reports and economic data releases that could sway market sentiment. Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) will share Q1 2026 earnings after the market closes. Analysts are closely watching for updates following the company’s recent announcement to cut approximately 5% of its workforce in one more corporate bid for AI-flavored “operational efficiency.” HP and Dollar General (DG) also report. The discount retailer is mid-turnaround, with its stock price recovering around 30% this year but still well off 52-week highs. Looking to the hard-economics side, expect BLS data on job opening and labor turnover at 10:00 a.m., alongside the Census Bureau’s Factory Orders and the OECD’s globe-spanning Economic Outlook. Wednesday brings another dose of retail and tech earnings. Dollar Tree will report before the bell. With roughly 40% of its inventory sourced from China, investors will parse the results for tariffs’ effects on retail. After the close, MongoDB and Five Below (FIVE) release their results, too. MongoDB’s earnings will offer a read on enterprise software spending amid a 40% drop in the company’s stock price since last year. Five Below’s report should reveal whether tween-and-teen discretionary spending on pool noodles, inflatable chairs, and Disney-branded collectibles is still chugging along. Economic data hits early, with the ADP private payrolls report for May landing around 8:15 a.m. ET, an important preview of government jobs numbers due later in the week. At 9:45 a.m., the final read on S&P Global’s U.S. Services PMI offers a snapshot of activity in the economy’s biggest sector, followed at 10:00 by the Census Bureau’s manufacturing shipments and inventory data. Thursday’s earnings lineup features Lululemon and DocuSign, both reporting after the bell. Lululemon’s results will shed light on a very important athleisure-maxi-dress debate (subject of much TikTok controversy), as well as international growth and inventory levels. DocuSign, meanwhile, will be watched for clues on whether demand for e-signatures and contract management is holding up in a tight corporate spending environment. Analysts expect modest growth but remain wary of margin pressures and customer churn. The macro calendar launches at 8:30 a.m. ET with revised productivity and labor cost data for Q1, which gives context regarding wage-inflation trends. Also at 8:30, the Census Bureau’s international trade report for April provides a look at goods and services flows amid the trade wars. Both reports could sway expectations heading into Friday’s closely watched jobs release. Friday is a pivotal day for markets. No major earnings releases are scheduled, but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Employment Situation report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Expect a comprehensive look at job growth, unemployment rates, and the overall health of the job market. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Famed market bear Albert Edwards tells BI stocks are vulnerable — and opens up about his role as Wall Street's 'uber-bear'

Even if the words coming out of Albert Edwards' mouth were gloomy, the famously bearish Société Générale strategist was in his usual good mood on Tuesday. It's something that tends to catch people off guard when they meet him, he said. "I'm quite a happy, upbeat person," Edwards told BI. "As opposed to the miserable bastard I come across in my written work." If you follow the British strategist's research, it's not hard to see why he comes across as a grouch. He is known as a perennial bear on Wall Street (he refuses the moniker of "perma-bear" and prefers "uber-bear"). His weekly client notes regularly question the prevailing market narrative and warn of downside scenarios. His latest report warned that rising Japanese bond yields could lead to a "global financial market Armageddon." His tune during a May 27 interview was no different. Edwards, who shot to fame for correctly calling the eventual dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said that stocks are still vulnerable to a pullback after their 18% rally from April lows. Despite investors starting to discount recession and inflation risks on the heels of President Donald Trump's tariff reductions, valuations remain high and risks abound, he said. One of those risks is the possibility that investors start to question hefty AI spending from the mega-cap tech firms. Another is a potential recession. But, in his opinion, the top risk the market should be aware of is rising Japanese interest rates, which could cause an exodus of capital from the US as investors unwind the yen carry trade and chase more attractive yields. The Bank of Japan, having kept interest rates low for years, pushed flows of money into US stocks and bonds. Now that the trend is reversing, those flows could grind to a halt, he said. Ultimately, however, it's not easy to know what will spark a stock-market decline. What's easier to know is simply that the market is in a precarious spot thanks to "steamy" valuations. One popular measure, the Shiller CAPE ratio, shows stock valuations at some of their highest levels in history. "These are really super high valuations," he said. "And you look at things like the relationship between bonds and equities, with bond yields where they are now and the equity risk premium being so low." "You just think, 'You're a bit vulnerable here to bad news, aren't you?'" he added. "Something comes along, you really are not in a great situation." Edwards is something of an anomaly on Wall Street. Most of the time, top strategists issue fairly bullish forecasts. For example, in January this year, the average 2025 S&P 500 price target saw 11.5% upside. Just two strategists — Stifel's Barry Bannister and BCA Research's Peter Berezin — predicted negative returns this year. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case, but suffice to say, investors were caught off guard by the S&P 500's 20% decline from February to April. It's these rapid declines, though few and far between, that Edwards wants investors to keep in mind as possible outcomes in frothy environments. As a result of pessimistic tendencies, Edwards isn't correct all too often, but that's not necessarily the point — and his readers know that. "A lot of clients who totally disagree with me like to read my stuff. It's a reality check," he said. Earlier this year, financial professionals detailed to BI the pressure that strategists face from both their bosses and clients if they're wrongly bearish for too long. David Rosenberg, who called the housing bubble and recession in the mid-to-late 2000s while working as the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the firm asked him not to use the word "bubble" to describe housing market dynamics at the time because it was scaring clients. Edwards said he doesn't feel that pressure. He writes his notes as Société Générale's "alternative view," separate from their house view. "You have to have good employers," he said. "People have said to me, 'If you worked at an American bank, you'd be fired immediately because of your views.'" Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five undervalued stocks represent quality companies trading at discounts to recent highs while ... More maintaining strong fundamentals and clear growth catalysts. The market's current volatility has created compelling opportunities for discerning investors willing to look beyond short-term noise. While headline indexes remain near historic highs, numerous quality companies are trading at significant discounts to their 52-week peaks, presenting attractive entry points for long-term wealth building. These dislocations often occur when broader market sentiment overshadows individual company fundamentals, creating the exact conditions where patient investors can capitalize. This analysis identifies five fundamentally strong companies currently trading at compelling valuations. Each selection represents a different sector, offering diversification benefits while maintaining focus on established businesses with durable competitive advantages, consistent cash generation and shareholder-friendly management teams that have weathered multiple economic cycles. The selection process prioritized companies trading at least 10% below their 52-week highs while maintaining strong underlying business fundamentals. Key evaluation criteria included consistent profitability, reasonable debt levels, competitive market positions, and management teams with proven track records of capital allocation and effective financial management. Special attention was given to dividend sustainability and growth potential, as these metrics often indicate management confidence in future cash flows. Additionally, each company needed to demonstrate resilience during recent market turbulence while showing clear catalysts for future growth. The focus remained on large-cap, established enterprises rather than speculative plays, ensuring each selection offers both value characteristics and quality business attributes that should appeal to conservative investors seeking both income and appreciation potential. ExxonMobil stands as America's largest publicly traded oil company, operating across the entire energy value chain, from exploration and production to refining and chemicals. The company has transformed its operational focus over recent years, prioritizing high-return, low-cost assets while maintaining one of the industry's strongest balance sheets. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding low-carbon solutions and optimizing its Permian Basin operations, which continue generating substantial free cash flow even at moderate oil prices. The company's integrated business model provides natural hedging between upstream and downstream operations, while its world-class refining network benefits from favorable crack spreads. Management has demonstrated disciplined capital allocation, returning significant cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases while maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities. Exxon's current valuation appears compelling given its strengthened operational efficiency and commitment to shareholder returns. The company trades at a meaningful discount despite generating robust cash flows and maintaining a fortress balance sheet with minimal debt concerns. Recent quarterly results demonstrated the effectiveness of the company's cost reduction initiatives, with strong margins achieved across all business segments. The energy transition presents both challenges and opportunities, but Exxon's low-carbon investments and carbon capture initiatives position it well for evolving market demands. The company's dividend yield of 3.86% appears sustainable based on current cash generation capabilities. In comparison, the stock's 18.7% discount from recent highs creates an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to the energy sector through a financially stable, dividend-paying leader. Fifth Third Bancorp operates as a diversified financial services company serving customers across the Midwest and Southeast through approximately 1,100 locations. The bank has established a reputation for prudent risk management and exceptional customer service, consistently maintaining strong credit quality metrics across various economic cycles. Recent strategic focus areas include digital transformation initiatives, commercial lending growth, and expansion of fee-based services, including wealth management and payment processing. The bank's geographic footprint covers economically diverse markets with steady population and business growth, providing a stable foundation for loan demand and deposit gathering. Management has consistently demonstrated disciplined expense management while investing in technology infrastructure to compete effectively with larger national banks and emerging fintech competitors. Fifth Third presents compelling value at current levels, trading at a significant discount despite maintaining solid operational metrics and capital strength. The bank's conservative approach to credit risk has positioned it well to withstand potential economic uncertainty, while rising interest rates are expected to benefit its net interest margins over time. Recent quarters have shown steady loan growth and improving efficiency ratios, indicating that management's operational execution remains strong. The 3.89% dividend yield appears well-covered by earnings, with management maintaining a conservative payout ratio that provides flexibility during challenging periods. Regional banks like Fifth Third often outperform during economic recovery phases, and the current 22.5% discount from recent highs creates an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to well-managed financial institutions with strong local market positions and proven management teams. Mondelez International operates as a leading global snacking company, owning iconic brands including Oreo, Cadbury, Toblerone, and Trident across the chocolate, biscuits, gum, and candy categories. The company maintains strong market positions in key geographic regions, with particular strength in emerging markets where rising disposable incomes drive consistent demand growth. Recent strategic initiatives focus on expanding premium product offerings and enhancing direct-to-consumer capabilities. The business benefits from recurring revenue characteristics as consumers regularly repurchase favorite snack brands, creating predictable cash flows that support consistent dividend payments and growth investments. Mondelez has demonstrated pricing power during inflationary periods while maintaining market share through effective brand management and innovation programs that resonate with evolving consumer preferences. Mondelez offers attractive defensive characteristics combined with growth potential in emerging markets where the company maintains leading positions. The stock's recent weakness appears overdone given the company's strong brand portfolio and consistent execution on margin improvement initiatives. Management has successfully navigated supply chain challenges while implementing strategic pricing actions that protect profitability. The consumer staples sector provides stability during uncertain economic periods, while Mondelez's global diversification reduces dependence on any single market. The 2.82% dividend yield, combined with the company's history of consistent dividend growth, appeals to income-focused investors. With shares trading 12.2% below recent highs despite posting positive year-to-date returns of 12.38%, the current valuation presents an opportunity to acquire a quality consumer products company at a reasonable price. General Dynamics operates as a premier aerospace and defense contractor, serving government and commercial customers through four main business segments: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems, and Technologies. The company builds Gulfstream business jets, Virginia-class submarines, Abrams tanks, and various mission-critical technologies for defense applications. Recent contract wins and robust order backlogs provide revenue visibility extending several years into the future. The defense contractor benefits from stable, long-term government contracts while the Gulfstream division serves affluent individuals and corporations seeking premium business aviation solutions. This diversification provides balance between government and commercial revenue streams, while the company's reputation for engineering excellence and program execution has earned it preferred contractor status across multiple defense platforms. General Dynamics trades at an attractive valuation, despite holding a strong competitive position in defense markets that are experiencing increased spending globally. Recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted the importance of defense capabilities, while growing international demand for proven American military systems creates additional growth opportunities. The company's submarine construction programs alone provide decades of contracted revenue streams. The Gulfstream business continues recovering from pandemic-related weakness, with order activity showing improvement as corporate travel normalizes and wealthy individuals invest in private aviation. Management maintains a conservative approach to capital allocation while consistently returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The 2.18% dividend yield, combined with the stock's 13.2% discount from recent peaks, creates an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to both defense spending trends and luxury aviation recovery. Honeywell International operates as a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving aerospace, building technologies, performance materials, and safety solutions markets. The company's portfolio encompasses aircraft engines, automation systems, specialty chemicals, and safety equipment utilized across various industrial, commercial, and residential applications. Recent strategic focus emphasizes software-enabled solutions and sustainable technologies that address climate and energy transition challenges. The company benefits from multiple long-term secular trends, including aircraft fleet modernization, the adoption of building automation, and industrial digitization initiatives. Honeywell's engineering capabilities and established customer relationships provide competitive advantages in developing next-generation solutions for evolving market needs. In contrast, its diversified end markets reduce dependence on any single industry cycle. Honeywell represents quality industrial exposure at a reasonable valuation, with shares trading only 7.3% below recent highs despite delivering the strong year-over-year performance of 16.07%. The company's transformation toward higher-margin, software-enabled businesses has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple Honeywell divisions as air travel continues normalizing globally. The building technologies segment positions Honeywell to benefit from increased focus on energy efficiency and innovative building solutions. At the same time, performance materials serve the growing demand for specialty chemicals and advanced materials. Management's consistent execution of operational improvement initiatives, combined with disciplined capital allocation and a 2.01% dividend yield, makes Honeywell an attractive investment for investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation themes at a reasonable entry point. Bottom Line These five undervalued stocks represent quality companies trading at discounts to recent highs while maintaining strong fundamentals and clear growth catalysts. Each selection offers different sector exposure—energy, banking, consumer staples, defense, and diversified industrials—providing portfolio diversification benefits. The combination of attractive dividend yields, proven management teams, and compelling valuations creates opportunities for both income and capital appreciation as market sentiment eventually recognizes their underlying value propositions.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial ... More sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. Market volatility and recent trade developments have created distinct opportunities across multiple sectors, from artificial intelligence powerhouses to healthcare giants navigating regulatory changes. Savvy investors are recognizing that current market dislocations often mask underlying business strength, particularly among companies with proven track records of innovation, market leadership and adaptability to changing economic conditions. This analysis identifies five compelling investment opportunities spanning technology, healthcare, industrials and data analytics sectors. Each selection represents companies well-positioned to benefit from long-term secular trends, trading at levels that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors with suitable time horizons and risk tolerance. The selection process emphasized companies demonstrating strong competitive moats, consistent revenue growth and clear catalysts for future expansion. Priority was given to market leaders within their respective industries, particularly those benefiting from transformative trends such as the adoption of artificial intelligence, healthcare innovation, industrial automation, and data-driven decision-making across enterprise markets. Each company needed to show resilient business models capable of generating sustainable cash flows while investing in growth initiatives. Special consideration was given to management teams with proven execution capabilities, strong balance sheets that provide strategic flexibility and business models positioned to benefit from ongoing technological and demographic shifts reshaping the global economy. Honeywell International stands as a premier diversified technology and manufacturing company, operating across aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and safety solutions. The company has successfully transformed itself into a software-enabled industrial leader, developing connected solutions that address critical challenges in automation, energy efficiency and digital transformation. Recent strategic initiatives focus on sustainable technologies, including renewable fuels, carbon capture solutions and next-generation automation systems. The company's diversified portfolio provides natural hedging against industry-specific downturns while positioning it to benefit from multiple long-term growth drivers. Honeywell's aerospace division serves both commercial and defense markets. At the same time, its building technologies segment capitalizes on increasing demand for innovative building solutions and energy management systems that reduce operational costs and environmental impact. Honeywell represents exceptional value in the industrial technology space, combining steady dividend income with significant growth potential from emerging technologies. The company's transformation toward higher-margin software and services has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Operating margins have expanded to over 20%, with return on invested capital consistently above 15%, reflecting disciplined capital allocation and strong pricing power. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple business segments as commercial aviation continues normalizing and defense spending remains robust globally. Honeywell’s Aerospace division contributed nearly 40% of total revenue in the last fiscal year and is expected to grow further as backlogs normalize and global air travel rebounds. The Building Technologies division positions Honeywell perfectly for the ongoing shift toward smart infrastructure and energy-efficient solutions, particularly as regulatory requirements drive the adoption of automated building management systems. This segment also supports a recurring revenue model through service contracts and software subscriptions, contributing to earnings stability. Management's consistent operational execution, combined with strategic investments in breakthrough technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and quantum computing applications, creates multiple pathways for long-term value creation while maintaining attractive current income through reliable dividend payments. With a payout ratio under 50% and consistent dividend increases, Honeywell remains a compelling choice for income-focused investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation. NVIDIA Corporation has emerged as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence computing, providing the essential hardware and software infrastructure powering the global AI revolution. The company's graphics processing units form the foundation for machine learning, data center acceleration, autonomous vehicle development and scientific computing applications across virtually every industry. Recent strategic partnerships, including collaborations with major technology companies and governments, demonstrate the critical nature of NVIDIA's technology in next-generation computing applications. The company's comprehensive AI platform extends beyond hardware to encompass software frameworks, development tools and cloud services, fostering long-term customer relationships and generating recurring revenue streams. NVIDIA's data center business has become the primary driver of growth. At the same time, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive segments provide diversification and additional expansion opportunities as AI capabilities are integrated across more applications. NVIDIA occupies a virtually unassailable position in one of the most transformative technology trends of this generation, with artificial intelligence adoption still in its early stages across most industries. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Saudi Arabia on AI initiatives, demonstrate the global strategic importance of NVIDIA's technology and provide new revenue opportunities in emerging markets seeking to build AI capabilities. The company's technological moat continues widening as competitors struggle to match NVIDIA's integrated hardware-software approach and extensive developer ecosystem. Gross margins remain strong, above 70%, reflecting the company's ability to command premium pricing in a high-demand market. While the stock trades at premium valuations, the massive addressable market for AI computing, combined with NVIDIA's dominant market share and accelerating adoption rates across enterprise and government sectors, justifies higher multiples. The company's ability to maintain pricing power while scaling production positions it for sustained revenue and margin expansion as AI infrastructure investments accelerate globally. UnitedHealth Group operates as America's largest healthcare company, serving over 50 million members through its UnitedHealthcare insurance business while providing comprehensive health services through its rapidly growing Optum division. The company has built an integrated healthcare ecosystem that combines insurance, pharmacy benefits, medical care delivery and health technology solutions, improving patient outcomes while reducing overall system costs. Despite recent stock volatility related to regulatory concerns, UnitedHealth's fundamental business model remains strong, benefiting from aging demographics, increasing healthcare utilization and the ongoing shift toward value-based care arrangements. The Optum division has become a significant growth driver, providing technology-enabled services that help healthcare providers improve efficiency and patient care quality. UnitedHealth's current valuation appears compelling given its dominant market position and multiple growth drivers across both insurance and services businesses. The recent regulatory-driven volatility, exacerbated by a high-profile fraud lawsuit, has led to a steep selloff, pushing the stock down significantly and compressing its valuation to a forward P/E of just 12. For a company with UnitedHealth’s scale, diversified revenue streams and consistent double-digit earnings growth over the past decade, this represents a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality business at a deep discount. The company's integrated model provides competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate. Healthcare spending continues growing faster than GDP, driven by demographic trends and medical innovation, creating a favorable operating environment. The company's investment in technology and data analytics capabilities positions it well for the ongoing transformation toward personalized medicine and value-based care delivery models. Optum's expansion into new markets and services provides significant revenue diversification beyond traditional insurance operations, while the company's strong balance sheet enables continued strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. The combination of defensive healthcare exposure and growth potential makes UnitedHealth attractive despite near-term legal and regulatory headwinds. Johnson & Johnson stands as one of the world's most diversified healthcare companies, combining leading pharmaceutical research with innovative medical devices and trusted consumer health products. The company's pharmaceutical division develops breakthrough treatments for cancer, immunology, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions, while its medical device business serves the global surgical, orthopedic, and vision care markets. The company has demonstrated remarkable consistency over decades, generating steady cash flows that support continuous research investment and regular dividend increases spanning over 60 years. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding oncology and immunology portfolios through both internal development and strategic acquisitions, while divesting non-core consumer brands to focus on higher-growth healthcare segments with stronger competitive positioning. Johnson & Johnson offers exceptional stability combined with growth potential from its industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and medical device innovations. The company's diversified revenue streams provide resilience during economic uncertainty. At the same time, its strong research capabilities and established regulatory relationships enable the successful development of breakthrough treatments that command premium pricing and market share. The pharmaceutical division's focus on high-value therapeutic areas, such as oncology and immunology, aligns with some of healthcare's fastest-growing segments—meanwhile, the medical device business benefits from aging demographics and increasing demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Management's disciplined capital allocation, combined with the company's AAA credit rating and commitment to dividend growth, makes Johnson & Johnson particularly attractive for conservative investors seeking reliable income growth, capital preservation and upside potential from medical innovation. Palantir Technologies specializes in big data analytics platforms that enable organizations to integrate, analyze and act upon massive datasets for critical decision-making. The company serves both government and commercial clients through its Gotham platform for defense and intelligence applications and Foundry platform for enterprise customers across industries, including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and financial services. The company's software enables customers to uncover hidden patterns in complex data, optimize operations and make data-driven decisions that were previously impossible due to technological limitations. Recent commercial expansion has accelerated as enterprises recognize the competitive advantages provided by advanced analytics capabilities. At the same time, government contracts continue providing a stable revenue foundation and development funding for cutting-edge capabilities. Palantir operates at the intersection of several powerful trends, including the adoption of artificial intelligence, digital transformation and data-driven decision-making across both government and enterprise markets. The stock's strong 2025 performance reflects growing recognition of the company's unique capabilities and expanding market opportunities as organizations prioritize analytics investments to maintain competitive advantages. The company's government relationships provide both revenue stability and access to cutting-edge use cases that drive product development, while commercial market expansion offers significant scalability potential. Palantir's software platforms create high switching costs once implemented, leading to strong customer retention and expanding usage over time. The increasing importance of data analytics across all industries, combined with Palantir's proven ability to handle complex, mission-critical applications, positions the company for sustained growth as digital transformation accelerates across both public and private sectors. Bottom Line These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. From NVIDIA's AI dominance to Johnson & Johnson's healthcare stability, UnitedHealth's integrated model and ultra cheap valuation due to regulatory risks, Honeywell's industrial innovation, and Palantir's data analytics leadership, investors gain exposure to multiple growth drivers while balancing risk across different market segments and business models.

The company has successfully transformed itself into a software-enabled industrial leader, developing connected solutions that address critical challenges in automation, energy efficiency and digital transformation. Recent strategic initiatives focus on sustainable technologies, including renewable fuels, carbon capture solutions and next-generation automation systems. The company's diversified portfolio provides natural hedging against industry-specific downturns while positioning it to benefit from multiple long-term growth drivers. Honeywell's aerospace division serves both commercial and defense markets. At the same time, its building technologies segment capitalizes on increasing demand for innovative building solutions and energy management systems that reduce operational costs and environmental impact. Honeywell represents exceptional value in the industrial technology space, combining steady dividend income with significant growth potential from emerging technologies. The company's transformation toward higher-margin software and services has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Operating margins have expanded to over 20%, with return on invested capital consistently above 15%, reflecting disciplined capital allocation and strong pricing power. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple business segments as commercial aviation continues normalizing and defense spending remains robust globally. Honeywell’s Aerospace division contributed nearly 40% of total revenue in the last fiscal year and is expected to grow further as backlogs normalize and global air travel rebounds. The Building Technologies division positions Honeywell perfectly for the ongoing shift toward smart infrastructure and energy-efficient solutions, particularly as regulatory requirements drive the adoption of automated building management systems. This segment also supports a recurring revenue model through service contracts and software subscriptions, contributing to earnings stability. Management's consistent operational execution, combined with strategic investments in breakthrough technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and quantum computing applications, creates multiple pathways for long-term value creation while maintaining attractive current income through reliable dividend payments. With a payout ratio under 50% and consistent dividend increases, Honeywell remains a compelling choice for income-focused investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation. NVIDIA Corporation has emerged as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence computing, providing the essential hardware and software infrastructure powering the global AI revolution. The company's graphics processing units form the foundation for machine learning, data center acceleration, autonomous vehicle development and scientific computing applications across virtually every industry. Recent strategic partnerships, including collaborations with major technology companies and governments, demonstrate the critical nature of NVIDIA's technology in next-generation computing applications. The company's comprehensive AI platform extends beyond hardware to encompass software frameworks, development tools and cloud services, fostering long-term customer relationships and generating recurring revenue streams. NVIDIA's data center business has become the primary driver of growth. At the same time, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive segments provide diversification and additional expansion opportunities as AI capabilities are integrated across more applications. NVIDIA occupies a virtually unassailable position in one of the most transformative technology trends of this generation, with artificial intelligence adoption still in its early stages across most industries. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Saudi Arabia on AI initiatives, demonstrate the global strategic importance of NVIDIA's technology and provide new revenue opportunities in emerging markets seeking to build AI capabilities. The company's technological moat continues widening as competitors struggle to match NVIDIA's integrated hardware-software approach and extensive developer ecosystem. Gross margins remain strong, above 70%, reflecting the company's ability to command premium pricing in a high-demand market. While the stock trades at premium valuations, the massive addressable market for AI computing, combined with NVIDIA's dominant market share and accelerating adoption rates across enterprise and government sectors, justifies higher multiples. The company's ability to maintain pricing power while scaling production positions it for sustained revenue and margin expansion as AI infrastructure investments accelerate globally. UnitedHealth Group operates as America's largest healthcare company, serving over 50 million members through its UnitedHealthcare insurance business while providing comprehensive health services through its rapidly growing Optum division. The company has built an integrated healthcare ecosystem that combines insurance, pharmacy benefits, medical care delivery and health technology solutions, improving patient outcomes while reducing overall system costs. Despite recent stock volatility related to regulatory concerns, UnitedHealth's fundamental business model remains strong, benefiting from aging demographics, increasing healthcare utilization and the ongoing shift toward value-based care arrangements. The Optum division has become a significant growth driver, providing technology-enabled services that help healthcare providers improve efficiency and patient care quality. UnitedHealth's current valuation appears compelling given its dominant market position and multiple growth drivers across both insurance and services businesses. The recent regulatory-driven volatility, exacerbated by a high-profile fraud lawsuit, has led to a steep selloff, pushing the stock down significantly and compressing its valuation to a forward P/E of just 12. For a company with UnitedHealth’s scale, diversified revenue streams and consistent double-digit earnings growth over the past decade, this represents a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality business at a deep discount. The company's integrated model provides competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate. Healthcare spending continues growing faster than GDP, driven by demographic trends and medical innovation, creating a favorable operating environment. The company's investment in technology and data analytics capabilities positions it well for the ongoing transformation toward personalized medicine and value-based care delivery models. Optum's expansion into new markets and services provides significant revenue diversification beyond traditional insurance operations, while the company's strong balance sheet enables continued strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. The combination of defensive healthcare exposure and growth potential makes UnitedHealth attractive despite near-term legal and regulatory headwinds. Johnson & Johnson stands as one of the world's most diversified healthcare companies, combining leading pharmaceutical research with innovative medical devices and trusted consumer health products. The company's pharmaceutical division develops breakthrough treatments for cancer, immunology, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions, while its medical device business serves the global surgical, orthopedic, and vision care markets. The company has demonstrated remarkable consistency over decades, generating steady cash flows that support continuous research investment and regular dividend increases spanning over 60 years. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding oncology and immunology portfolios through both internal development and strategic acquisitions, while divesting non-core consumer brands to focus on higher-growth healthcare segments with stronger competitive positioning. Johnson & Johnson offers exceptional stability combined with growth potential from its industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and medical device innovations. The company's diversified revenue streams provide resilience during economic uncertainty. At the same time, its strong research capabilities and established regulatory relationships enable the successful development of breakthrough treatments that command premium pricing and market share. The pharmaceutical division's focus on high-value therapeutic areas, such as oncology and immunology, aligns with some of healthcare's fastest-growing segments—meanwhile, the medical device business benefits from aging demographics and increasing demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Management's disciplined capital allocation, combined with the company's AAA credit rating and commitment to dividend growth, makes Johnson & Johnson particularly attractive for conservative investors seeking reliable income growth, capital preservation and upside potential from medical innovation. Palantir Technologies specializes in big data analytics platforms that enable organizations to integrate, analyze and act upon massive datasets for critical decision-making. The company serves both government and commercial clients through its Gotham platform for defense and intelligence applications and Foundry platform for enterprise customers across industries, including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and financial services. The company's software enables customers to uncover hidden patterns in complex data, optimize operations and make data-driven decisions that were previously impossible due to technological limitations. Recent commercial expansion has accelerated as enterprises recognize the competitive advantages provided by advanced analytics capabilities. At the same time, government contracts continue providing a stable revenue foundation and development funding for cutting-edge capabilities. Palantir operates at the intersection of several powerful trends, including the adoption of artificial intelligence, digital transformation and data-driven decision-making across both government and enterprise markets. The stock's strong 2025 performance reflects growing recognition of the company's unique capabilities and expanding market opportunities as organizations prioritize analytics investments to maintain competitive advantages. The company's government relationships provide both revenue stability and access to cutting-edge use cases that drive product development, while commercial market expansion offers significant scalability potential. Palantir's software platforms create high switching costs once implemented, leading to strong customer retention and expanding usage over time. The increasing importance of data analytics across all industries, combined with Palantir's proven ability to handle complex, mission-critical applications, positions the company for sustained growth as digital transformation accelerates across both public and private sectors. Bottom Line These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. From NVIDIA's AI dominance to Johnson & Johnson's healthcare stability, UnitedHealth's integrated model and ultra cheap valuation due to regulatory risks, Honeywell's industrial innovation, and Palantir's data analytics leadership, investors gain exposure to multiple growth drivers while balancing risk across different market segments and business models.

Title: Streetwear Marketing: Definition, Strategies + Examples (2025) - Shopify Australia
URL: https://www.shopify.com/au/enterprise/blog/how-retailers-use-streetwear-brands-to-reach-todays-consumers
Time Published: 2025-05-31T20:18:33Z
Full Content:
Consumer brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma see major growth opportunities in the newfound elevation of streetwear. All of a sudden, they’re more than just sports apparel brands—they’re nods to high fashion, open doors to what’s cool. These brands also know “sneakerheads”—people who are addicted to the chase for an exclusive item—will wait hours in front of a store for a limited-edition product. The coinciding rise of athleisure (a hybrid of gymwear and leisure clothing), and the celebrity influence on that stream of fashion, has further encouraged these consumer brands to lean into the fashion-meets-casual streetwear look. It’s contributing to a streetwear industry valued in excess of $347 billion. Streetwear is a type of casual clothing heavily influenced by popular culture. It’s an eclectic mix of apparel from New York’s hip-hop culture and California skateboarding fashion that became popular in the 1990s. Today, streetwear dominates the social media scene. This has contributed to a global streetwear industry that accounts for about 10% of the global footwear and fashion industry. Growth in the streetwear market shows no signs of slowing down. Experts predict the industry will hit a $637 billion valuation by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.89%. Why? Because customers spend big bucks on streetwear: Sneakers are the standout streetwear product, with 62% of consumers selecting footwear as the item they were most likely to buy. Other popular streetwear pieces include oversized t-shirts, hoodies, and joggers. Unlike traditional luxury retail, buying streetwear involves cultural knowledge as much as disposable income. The Streetwear Impact Report notes 70% of streetwear customers value brands’ commitment to social issues, with 59% prioritizing brand activism. Moreover, 47% indicated they would likely stop purchasing from brands with representatives who behave inappropriately. Streetwear buyers tend to be millennial or Gen Z, and have some disposable income. They’re typically working professionals who don’t have children or mortgages to worry about, and have lived most of their lives online. A report by Hypebeast confirms this: Kristen Classi-Zummo, apparel industry analyst at NPD, told Vogue Business that “Gen Z wants a bike short that they can wear to both the airport or to brunch, but they are also looking for it to keep them cool and stay in place.” Thanks to the democratization of social media, everyone will know that a cool t-shirt is expensive or a pair of headphones costs $3,000. The rise of the tech sector and fewer traditional industries employing young people has also meant smart, expressive and casual clothing is now more accepted in the workplace. Social commerce platforms like TikTok and Instagram dominate the marketing strategies of many streetwear brands for this reason. The typical user of both platforms is a Gen Z consumer who’s grown up in a hyperconnected digital world where likes are a normalized currency. Streetwear shoppers show diverse shopping habits but strongly prefer direct channels. According to Hypebeast, 53% of consumers prefer buying from physical brand stores, while 42% favor brands' own ecommerce sites. This highlights Gen Z and millennials' desire for exclusive, direct interactions rather than shopping via multi-brand retailers or social media. When you work for a streetwear company, it’s easy to get caught up in the nitty gritty details of your product. After all, you’re proud of each item, and they tend to sell out. But streetwear customers don’t always buy individual items because of their impressive specifications. People buy them to fit into streetwear culture—a lifestyle movement where dressed-down, comfortable clothing is a social status. Maniere De Voir is one streetwear brand which took this approach with a marketing campaign. Slotted between Instagram posts that showcase their products, they publish short-form videos that sell the lifestyle their target audience is looking to create. This Instagram Reel, for example, showcases interior design that’s cozy and minimalist—two adjectives that customers would use to describe the brand's image. Incorporate this into your streetwear brand marketing strategy by creating a broader identity around your clothing brand. What words would customers use to describe your streetwear items? What does their dream life look like? Angle your marketing campaigns around the answers to sell the lifestyle they want to create using your apparel. The roots of streetwear’s community culture go back to niche online forums like NikeTalk, BapeTalk, and Strictly Supreme. Although these early forums have declined, the community ethos persists on platforms like Instagram, driving brand loyalty through shared cultural connections and peer-to-peer inspiration. Tap into these communities when you’re: Streetwear brand Charlie Hustle is one retailer using the local community approach to drive consumer loyalty. Their slogan is “do good, feel good, look good”—a motto the brand helps their audience achieve through their Communi-TEES program. Consumers in the Kansas City area can donate to local charities through any purchase they make on the brand’s direct-to-consumer store. The digital-native Gen Z relies heavily on social media influence when determining which products to buy. For the majority of streetwear customers, social media is the top source of inspiration. It beats the street, word of mouth, and fashion publications. This makes sense—Gen Z’s purchasing habits are wildly different from older generations. Data compiled in the Shopper Preference Report for 2025 found that almost 80% of Gen Z and millennials use social media to make purchases. But a simple social media marketing strategy isn’t enough. Although Hypebeast found most consumers use social media as a source of information, just 31% consider a brand’s own social media presence an important factor. Plus, with platforms like TikTok enabling everyone to be a creator, fashion brands can tap into the social nature of streetwear while publishing the user-generated content their audiences trust. Shopify Collabs helps brands discover creators, influencers, and affiliates in the streetwear industry. Partner with these creators—be that through gifted products, sponsored posts, or affiliate commissions—to generate UGC through influencer marketing. This will show how your streetwear items look on real people. Streetwear brands are leaning into co-marketing opportunities as a way to stand out in a saturated market. Shopify’s Alex Danco says that "the biggest opportunity flying under the radar is collaboration. It’s the best way to increase the number of buyers who know and care about you in a way that turns you into not competitors but cooperators, perhaps even allies and friends.” Identify brands that share your audience. The best collaborations are between two brands that share overlapping brand values and customer demographics without being direct competitors. Alex adds: “Collaboration is truly the win-win way for brands to find new audiences in a way that doesn’t dilute your brands.” Sportswear-turned-streetwear label Puma takes this to the extreme with their Dua Lipa partnership. The singer, known for her casual fashion sense, launched a limited edition collection with the brand. Both parties went back and forth on Instagram to strengthen the partnership and get both customer bases excited. The sneakers element is a particularly interesting collaboration. Hypebeast reports that sneakers are the most popular streetwear product, but that this market is also one of the most saturated. As Zofia Zwieglinska, international fashion reporter at Glossy, says, “Most brands dedicate a portion of their collection to streetwear, and sneakers in particular. Tie-ins to art and music have continued—from the Nike x RTFKT partnership with Takashi Murakami to Tiffany's tie-in with Basquiat and Beyonce. “However, sneakers and streetwear have reached a saturation point—the differentiators now will be with brands that can evolve it to suit a new type of customer.” Gen Z uses social media to research brands more often than search engines, and social media is driving in-store foot traffic (and subsequent sales) for many streetwear retailers. More than half of customers say they’re most likely to buy streetwear items through a physical brand store, followed by 42% who head to the retailer’s ecommerce website—which is why 60% of retailers say flagship locations are a key part of their brand strategy. British streetwear brand Corteiz has mastered this online-to-offline marketing strategy. Their social media presence drives in-person commerce with time-sensitive product drops at key locations in London. This Instagram post, for example, encouraged followers to visit the brand’s market stall with 99p in exact change to buy their blackout cargo trousers. The stall was only open for two hours, and coordinates for the location dropped just a few hours before the event began. The viral nature of Corteiz’s in-person product drops helps build a base of die-hard fans who want in on the brand’s community. So much so, people document their attempts to locate Corteiz’s product drop locations on YouTube and TikTok—a streetwear brand marketing idea that gets customers to do the legwork of building hype around product drops. Experiment with new markets and products quickly—without the overhead. Make sales wherever your customers are with Shopify POS and mobile card readers, so you can accept payments on the spot. Learn more With customers craving experiences from the streetwear brands they interact with, the metaverse—a 3D virtual experience where customers can play, shop, and interact with other people—is quickly becoming a staple in many marketing strategies. German sneaker retailer Flowers For Society is one label centered heavily around metaverse experiences. Their first product drop, which was only available through preorder, linked every item with a unique non-fungible token (NFT). Customers gained access to the brand’s own metaverse community, unlocking exclusive access to future product drops, limited edition apparel, and exclusive collaborations. Sell NFTs on your streetwear store with Shopify. Give customers exclusive access to products, collections, and discounts, and sync your store with community engagement channels like Discord—all in one place. Exclusivity is an important element for streetwear fans. Zofia from Glossy says, “Digital-native brands need to focus on how streetwear customers interpret value differently to their other customers. Aspects like rarity, collectability, and wider cultural value matter more to these customers, as well as engagement with the brand community.” Two-thirds of streetwear brands surveyed by Hypebeast described the drop model as important to their business. It capitalizes on rarity, collectability, and cultural value by making streetwear products time- or quantity-limited. Streetwear brand Live Fast Die Young uses the drops model to fuel their social media campaigns. On Instagram, the retailer regularly teases new product drops, such as their new 54-piece collection. Customers flock to the comment section to express their anticipation. Maksim Telkov, ecommerce manager at Live Fast Die Young, adds: “With our product drop strategy, we always had problems with over ordering or that payments didn't go through. With Shopify, these issues were resolved all at once.” Use Shopify’s preordering functionality to create product pages and capture leads before the product goes on sale. You’ll be able to take full, partial, or no payment from customers and set expectations on when the item will be delivered. If they don’t buy this time, an automated email marketing series can convert subscribers into paying customers. Email your subscribers when the product drops—a surefire way to get their attention, rather than relying on a social media post which might get buried in a crowded feed. Sustainability is more than a buzzword for modern consumers—McKinsey reports that two in three customers think sustainability is an important factor when buying apparel. Customers have the same approach to sustainability when purchasing streetwear. The majority of consumers said social issues were important to them, with brand activism playing a role in the clothing brands consumers choose to connect with. Coney Island Picnic cofounder and creative director Ryan Wood says the brand prioritized sustainability in their mission to keep up with consumer preferences: “About a year ago, our brand made the conscious decision to shift the manufacturing of all tees and fleece to be sourced from organic cotton without raising the price for customers.” This commitment to sustainability is deeply rooted across every aspect of the brand’s marketing strategy. Coney Island Picnic displays a “sustainable” category in their ecommerce navigation, produces short-form TikTok videos to explain their brand mission, and highlights how products are made using organic cotton within product descriptions. Ryan says: “As we know, the fast fashion industry's current trajectory will not sustain much longer, and many consumers want to avoid being a part of the wasteful cycle. Therefore, more consumers are taking note of sustainable retailers they can trust and becoming repeat customers.” If you’re not in a position to make your products more sustainable, don’t try to pull the wool over your customers’ eyes. Greenwashing—the term people use to describe clothing brands that exaggerate their role in making their business more sustainable—doesn’t fly with Gen Z customers. You can make small changes to prove your streetwear brand is moving in the right direction without overhauling your entire logistics strategy or supply chain. The Shopify Planet app, for example, makes a small contribution to the Shopify Sustainability Fund. This fund is used to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and make shipping carbon-neutral. Gen Z has had to thrive in difficult economic conditions. They report higher rates of anxiety, depression, and distress than any other demographic, often turning to nostalgia as a temporary escape from normal life. Business Insider reports the nostalgia trend is being driven by this generation. In the article, Krystine Batcho, professor and psychologist at Le Moyne College, says, “For many people, particularly young adults or those without a financial safety net, poor economic conditions raise fears of being able to meet financial obligations like rent or student-debt payments.” Related hashtags like #nostalgia and #Y2K are both thriving on TikTok, having each amassed billions of views. Streetwear brands are tapping into this nostalgia to connect with Gen Z consumers. Mauv Studio, for example, launched an entire brand that reflected the Y2K aesthetic. Experiential drops amplify streetwear’s exclusivity. Supreme and luxury brands like Dior and Burberry have adopted the drops model, limiting product availability to enhance desirability. Hypebeast notes that 66% of streetwear industry respondents view the drops model as core to their strategy. Corteiz created significant buzz with their DA GREAT DENIM EXCHANGE popup event in Brooklyn. Founder Clint Ogbenna, known simply as "Clint," announced the event just 24 hours in advance on Instagram. Folks came down to exchange jeans from popular brands (Levi’s, True Religion, Carhartt, etc.) right off their bodies for a free pair of Corteiz denim. The tactic was covered by outlets like GQ and earned hundreds of thousands of views on social media, a massive win for Corteiz. Clint himself appeared at the event, personally interacting with attendees and handing out individually numbered dollar bills as tickets. The traded-in jeans were later donated to youth charities, adding a social-impact dimension. New York-based brand Supreme is highly regarded for its influence on streetwear culture. What started as a Manhattan skateboarding store turned into a business acquired for $2.1 billion by VF, the parent company of VANS. Every new product is associated with a time-sensitive drop only available at one of their 11 retail stores. But you need an invite to get there, and a one-purchase per person limit applies. Only customers on Supreme’s mailing list get the “golden ticket”—an invitation to join the hundreds of people that queue around the block to get their hands on a Supreme drop. And if they want more than one piece, they’ll need to bring a friend. The founder of iconic streetwear brand A Bathing Ape (BAPE), Japanese artist Nigo, intentionally made a limited amount of merchandise when he started out in the early 1990s because he knew the desire for exclusivity would help his brand grow. HighSnobiety reports that “Nigo started out on a tight budget and could only afford to produce around 50 T-shirts a week—but he also disliked the idea of everyone wearing the same thing.” Alongside their drop model, BAPE got celebrities to wear their products to build hype and create the social symbol many streetwear customers aspire to. Hip-hop stars like The Notorious B.I.G and Pharrell sported BAPE products, with Soulja Boy even rapping the words “I got me some Bathing Ape” in his 3x Platinum hitCrank That. Australian streetwear retailer Culture Kings is known for its shopping experience. Instead of allowing shoppers to passively browse items, their stores are a true community experience. The non-shopping activities on offer include: Culture Kings turned to Shopify with a goal to mimic these in-store experiences for global shoppers online. They customized their storefront to display tailored, dynamic product listings with a “Shop the Look” page. Anyone viewing the brand’s social media content could easily shop the latest products through this landing page. Simon Beard, cofounder of Culture Kings, said: “Shopify—what it really did is allow us to more focus on our art side rather than being so bogged down in the science side, which was not our forte. It really enabled us to scale, knowing that we had this platform that delivered, that can grow with us.” Off-White differentiates itself from other streetwear players by bridging the gap between luxury brands and pop culture. Their founder and former artistic director of Louis Vuitton, the late Virgil Abloh, started the company in 2012 under the original name Pyrex Vision. According to Front Office Sports, Off-White came to life as a result of Abloh’s 3% approach—the idea that a new design could be created with just a 3% difference. Part of this differentiation includes irony—a sense of humor Gen Z consumers can bond over. Many of Off-White’s streetwear products obviously state the use case in quotation marks, like this windbreaker coat with the word “water” splashed across the back. Princess Polly, an established streetwear company located in Australia, took a unique approach with their marketing strategy. Alongside becoming a staple in their Gen Z customers’ shopping routine, the streetwear brand wanted to deliver a seamless experience long after the first purchase. Alexandria Collis, director of operations at Princess Polly, says, "We're always looking for ways to create less pressure points for customers. Making returns difficult shouldn't be the goal—there's actually a real opportunity to create loyalty through the return experience." The first stage was Princess Polly’s migration from Magento to Shopify. They then enlisted the help of Shopify Technology Partner Loop to access measurable returns insights and allow customers to exchange items, rather than request a refund. The result? Princess Polly saw a 55% reduction in out-of-stock rates with their new instant exchange function. Alexandria Collis adds: "Thanks to Shopify and Loop, we’ve seen a huge improvement in our return experience, with customers telling us firsthand that they appreciate how easy it is. And not only is it improving our customer loyalty—it's also driving a significant uptick in revenue." Kyle Ng, founder of the streetwear brand Brain Dead, is redefining streetwear culture through a maximalist, community-focused approach. Kyle is building an expansive lifestyle around eclectic interests, hosting hardcore music festivals, running a movie theater (Brain Dead Studios), organizing Magic: The Gathering tournaments, and collaborating creatively with figures like Jeff Goldblum, Seth Rogen, and Freddie Gibbs. Brain Dead has also branched out, notably reviving avant-garde Oakley shoe designs from the 1990s. Kyle actively avoids mainstream, predictable brand collaborations, instead choosing projects driven by genuine personal interests and niche subcultures, like vegan burgers or indigenous artisan-made Minion products featuring the familiar characters from the Despicable Me franchise. In September 2021, luxury fashion brand Balenciaga took fashion marketing to a new level by partnering with Fortnite, one of the most popular video games globally with over one million players at any given moment. Balenciaga designed digital outfits, known as “skins,” that players could buy within the Fortnite in-game store. The skins were inspired by real-life garments that incorporated Fortnite’s cartoon-like aesthetic. The campaign was the first of its kind to merge digital and real-life experiences. It targeted Fortnite’s Gen Z user base and made the Balenciaga brand relevant and culturally significant to a new generation. Streetwear is a competitive branch of the fashion industry. Brands who stand out don’t just sell products—they create communities around their products, selling the complete lifestyle and status symbol. Use these streetwear marketing strategies to meet customers where they are. From inducing scarcity with product drops to experimenting with the metaverse, do it all with Shopify's all-in-one ecommerce platform for scaling stores. You can promote your streetwear brand by launching limited product drops, documenting your production process on TikTok, proving your commitment to sustainability, blending online and offline experiences, and collaborating with streetwear creators. To stand out, a streetwear brand should partner with content creators, sell a lifestyle instead of just products, back up sustainability claims, tap into nostalgia, and use experiential retail to build deeper connections with consumers. Gen Z are the largest demographic for streetwear, making up 70% of all customers. They are typically working professionals who are active on social media and have disposable income to spend on fashion.

Title: ELV CLASS NOTICE: Elevance Health, Inc. Investors may have been Affected by Fraud – Contact BFA Law before July 11 Court Deadline (NYSE:ELV)

May 31, 2025 07:06 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Nvidia can't be stopped, Apple falls behind, and the AI data center race: Tech news roundup

2 / 11 When Microsoft (MSFT) pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month and a Wells Fargo (WFC) report suggested Amazon (AMZN) Web Services was reconsidering some leases, market watchers quickly diagnosed the symptoms: AI bubble concerns, demand uncertainty, and the inevitable cooldown after years of breakneck expansion. Read More 3 / 11 The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. Read More 4 / 11 Nvidia (NVDA) continues to go beyond expectations — even if things are a little more complicated this time around. Its strong first-quarter headline numbers show that Nvidia’s AI thesis is as strong as ever and that its margins remain elite, despite facing significant headwinds due to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 processors to China and other geopolitical concerns. Read More 5 / 11 A new study from Google Researchers is raising questions about whether quantum computing will hamper your ability to keep your crypto wallet secure. Google’s (GOOGL) Craig Gidney, a quantum research scientist, and Sophie Schmieg, a senior staff cryptography engineer, published a blog post on Friday showing a quantum computer could potentially break RSA encryption — the public-key encryption algorithm used to secure data such as for cryptocurrencies — with 20 times fewer quantum resources than they previously believed. Read More 6 / 11 Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei has issued a stark warning: Artificial intelligence could eliminate up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, pushing U.S. unemployment to 10–20% within the next one to five years. Read More 7 / 11 Nvidia’s (NVDA) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Read More 8 / 11 Salesforce said Tuesday it will acquire the cloud data management company Informatica for $8 billion in equity value as it seeks to further compete in the global artificial intelligence race. Read More 9 / 11 Most companies can’t shrug off an $8 billion loss. Then again, most companies aren’t Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday’s first-quarter earnings call, Wall Street zeroed in on Nvidia’s obvious weak spot: China. Thanks to U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia’s custom-built H20 chips, designed to skirt earlier rules, have essentially been made worthless. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress confirmed the damage: “Had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20” in the quarter.

Title: Costco Stock Has a Big Price Tag. Some Investors Are Eyeing a Rare Split

Shoppers are fans of Costco’s prices. Could the warehouse giant’s stock get a smaller price tag, too? That’s on some investors’ minds lately, with shares of Costco Wholesale (COST) among the most-expensive—on a straightforward price-per-share basis—in the S&P 500: The stock, which closed Friday at around $1,040, was one of a dozen with a four-digit share price. (Topping the list, for those who track such things, was NVR (NVR), shares of which ended the week above $7,000 apiece.) Costco’s shares have gotten there in part due to a rise of roughly 25% over the past 12 months, and now there’s renewed chatter about whether the company might choose to split the stock. (Stock splits do nothing to the value of a company—broadly, a 10-for-1 split means that instead of one $100 share, you have 10 $10 shares—but they’re sometimes taken as a bullish signal.) “We remain upbeat on the company's ability to gain share going forward and believe shares are positioned for continued outperformance in the current backdrop. Catalysts from here, in our view, include a potential stock split,” Oppenheimer analysts—who have a bullish rating on the shares, along with a $1,130 price target that is above the Wall Street average as tracked by Visible Alpha—wrote late Thursday after Costco reported quarterly financial results. Talk of a Costco split bubbles up from time to time partly because the company rarely does them; it hasn’t happened since a two-for-one split in early 2000. Management was asked about splits at the company’s January shareholder meeting, with CEO Ron Vachris saying there was “nothing to report.” The company didn’t respond to Investopedia’s request for comment in time for publication. CFO Gary Millerchip on a December conference call said that making the shares comparatively cheap is less useful to investors now than in years past because of the availability of fractional shares. “But we do also recognize that there's a benefit of the stock feeling more affordable for our retail investors and employees who are very important constituents for us," he said. "So we'll continue to evaluate over time.”

Title: BI Investor of the Month: Meet the fund manager up 28% over the last year
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/bi-investor-of-the-month-fund-manager-returning-28-over-last-year-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-31T08:46:01Z
Full Content:
Ankur Crawford, manager of the Alger Concentrated Equity ETF (CNEQ), is BI's Investor of the Month for May. Crawford's growth fund launched in April 2024 and has burst onto the scene. Over the last 12 months, it's up 30%, which was good enough to beat 96% of similar funds, according to Morningstar data. The S&P 500, by comparison, has returned 12% in that time. In May alone, CNEQ rose 17%. Crawford said the fund, which has 30 holdings, focuses on finding companies with little to no competition and, therefore, the ability to keep prices and profits high. "I would say 50% of the portfolio would liken itself to being an oligopoly or a monopoly," she said. "A great example of that is we own Ferrari. There's only one Ferrari, and they can raise prices however much they want; they are still sold out for three years." Thematically, Crawford said the fund is betting big on artificial intelligence, which she called "one of the biggest opportunities that we see, probably of our generation." Despite sparking a market frenzy since late 2022, the AI trade is still in its early days, she said, and likely has legs for another 5-10 years. "It is a game-changing technology that is still in its infancy," she said. "What it will do to companies that furnish it and companies that are part of building out the infrastructure is significant." The top holdings in CNEQ reflect Crawford's affinity for AI: Nvidia (NVDA) has a 13.18% weighting, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at 10.06%, Amazon (AMZN) at 9.27%, and Meta Platforms (META) at 6.1%. Crawford highlighted two companies in particular as leading the AI trade going forward, and that also fit her preference for monopoly or oligopoly firms: graphic processing unit maker Nvidia and semiconductor producer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). While both have high valuations, they also have pricing power that's just about unmatched. "Being the only player in the world that can do something so important, I would argue TSM is probably the most strategic business on this planet," Crawford said. "That comes with a lot of rewards, including pricing power." Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis. Leveraged funds are not considered. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to

While both have high valuations, they also have pricing power that's just about unmatched. "Being the only player in the world that can do something so important, I would argue TSM is probably the most strategic business on this planet," Crawford said. "That comes with a lot of rewards, including pricing power." Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis. Leveraged funds are not considered. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to
