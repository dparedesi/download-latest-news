A GROUP OF youths who broke a teenager’s fingers in south county Dublin told him not to mess with lads from their school again, a court has heard. One of the group of perpetrators, Luke Daly (23), has had his sentence deferred after he pleaded guilty to simple assault at Rock Road, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 7 December 2019. Daly, of Booterstown Avenue, Booterstown, Co Dublin, was one of ten or 20 youths who set upon the victim in what a judge said “may have been a case of mistaken identity”. Daly admitted grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him to the ground, however, gardaí could not say that he had any role in kicking or hitting. The victim suffered three fractured fingers when he was kicked by some of the youths as he went to get the DART home after attending a house party. At Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, Daly was ordered to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pending sentence next April. Judge Orla Crowe said the offence would warrant a sentence of two months, but that she intended to dispose of the case under Section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act. Daly was also ordered to pay the victim the sum of €3,000, which he had offered as a token of his remorse. Judge Crowe said the victim in the case was “entirely innocent and blameless” and simply should not have been subject to attack. Garda Eoin O’Mahony told Alison Fynes BL, prosecuting, that the victim went to a house party in Booterstown on the night, then left with some friends and his girlfriend to go to Domino’s Pizza. The victim told gardaí that shortly after 11pm, he was walking his girlfriend and two other friends towards the DART station, when he saw a group of ten or 20 lads walking behind them. Some of the group grabbed his friend, saying: “Can we have a chat?” and then pulled him to the ground. The victim said he ran to help his friend and then a lad ran after him, pulled him to the ground and a group began kicking him in the ribs. He asked them were they done and they replied: “Don’t mess with lads from (a particular school).” The victim’s friends gave similar statements, describing the large group as saying “You won’t mess with (a named school) again.” Advertisement The court heard there had been an altercation earlier on at a house party which did not involve either the victim or his friends. Daly was arrested and admitted to grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him down. He told gardaí pushes were exchanged and that the victim was on the ground when he left. The court heard that the large group of males had incorrectly assumed that the victim and his friend were part of a rival school. Daly had just turned 18 at the time, while the rest of the group of perpetrators were all underage. One of the other members of the group was assigned a Garda Junior Liaison Officer but no-one else was identified or prosecuted. The victim did not wish to attend court or make a victim impact statement, the court heard. Daly pleaded early at the District Court to the charge of simple assault, but the court referred the matter to the Circuit Court. Daly has no previous convictions and has not come to garda attention since, the court heard. Kevin Roche BL, defending, said it was an extremely childish incident which got out of control and was entirely out-of-character for his client. Counsel said this case has hung over Daly throughout his undergraduate degree and the Master’s degree he is currently doing. Daly, whose parents were present in court, was described as pro-social. The court heard that Daly has been putting money aside from part-time work and had brought the sum of €3,000 to court by way of compensation. Judge Crowe said it had been a “grave misunderstanding” and may have been a case of mistaken identity. The judge noted the large number of testimonials on Daly’s behalf and described him as a person of considerable academic and musical talent. “He has not come to any adverse attention since and has devoted his life to study. This was manifestly out-of-character. Gardaí have no concerns about this man,” added the judge. Daly is due back before court on 10 March 2025 for mention and final orders will be made on 10 April, when the case will be disposed of, if Daly has met all conditions.

Title: MicroStrategy Is a Strategic Buy to Capitalize on Bitcoin’s Outperformance
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-strategic-buy-capitalize-bitcoin-174706028.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:47:06Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a tech company that has spent the last few years accumulating Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet through a well-executed financing strategy. This approach supports my bullish stance on the company, particularly in a rising crypto market. MSTR has outperformed Bitcoin, highlighting the advantages of holding the company’s stock over directly investing in the cryptocurrency. By investing in MSTR, investors can amplify Bitcoin’s potential returns through a regulated stock, making it a more accessible option for institutional investors compared to holding cryptocurrency directly. Specifically, this year, MSTR shares have benefited from their high correlation with Bitcoin’s price swings, rallying over 211%. Recently, the shares saw an increase in momentum following the Fed’s interest rate cut. The last time this occurred, Bitcoin’s price more than doubled. In this article, I will delve into the strategy behind MicroStrategy’s business and explain why buying at current levels may be a wise decision. Before delving further into the bullish thesis, it’s essential to provide some context. MicroStrategy is (or was) primarily a data software company that helps customers make informed decisions by analyzing large sets of data from multiple sources. However, facing strong competition from powerful players like Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM), its core business has struggled to grow. About four years ago, the company pivoted to make aggressive investments in Bitcoin, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor, a staunch advocate of cryptocurrency. According to MicroStrategy’s shareholder letter released last year, the company holds an unwavering confidence in Bitcoin for the long term. The management team stated, “Because of its characteristics, we believe Bitcoin is a superior store of value, akin to digital gold or digital property. Just as records and CDs gave way to digital music, we believe gold and other traditional physical stores of value will give way to Bitcoin.” Currently, about 38% of MicroStrategy’s market cap corresponds to its Bitcoin holdings. By the end of July, MicroStrategy owned 226,500 Bitcoins, purchased at a total cost of $8.3 billion, and now valued at about $14.3 billion. The main bullish argument for MicroStrategy centers on its clever strategy of expanding its balance sheet through Bitcoin acquisitions. Since 2020, CEO Michael Saylor has focused on growing MicroStrategy’s value by buying Bitcoin with debt, particularly through convertible bonds, and capitalizing on the cryptocurrency’s high volatility. As the price of Bitcoin rises, the company is able to borrow even more money and add to its crypto holdings. At the same time, the company generates revenue from its software business, which amounted to $111 million in Q2, the most recent quarter. However, this represents a slowdown compared to the $120 million generated during the same period last year. As a result, over the past five years, MicroStrategy’s shares have appreciated by nearly 1,200%, closely mirroring fluctuations in Bitcoin prices. However, the journey has not always been smooth. A few years ago, high inflation and rising interest rates made it more expensive for the company to issue new debt or rollover existing obligations. During the crypto winter, from early 2021 to early 2023, MSTR shares plummeted by as much as 86%, falling to less than $15 per share. Today, however, shares have rebounded and exceed $185. My Buy stance on MicroStrategy extends to the belief that purchasing MicroStrategy stock may be more advantageous than buying the cryptocurrency or investing in a BTC fund. At first glance, it may seem illogical to pay a premium on MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV) in Bitcoin, which currently exceeds 2.3x. This premium reflects how much more or less the market values the company’s stock compared to its Bitcoin holdings alone, especially when you could simply buy the cryptocurrency directly. However, MicroStrategy’s primary advantage lies in its ability to capitalize on and acquire more Bitcoin. So far this year, the company issued two convertible debt offerings at less than 1% in March, scaled up its convertible note offering in June, and conducted another offering more recently in September, using the proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin. This ability to raise capital is one of the main justifications cited by Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who notes that the company has timed the market extraordinarily well. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin since it began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020. It has also outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY), NASDAQ (QQQ), gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and major tech stocks. Palmer concludes that, particularly in a bull market, the premium on MicroStrategy shares is justified, and I tend to agree. The Wall Street consensus on MSTR stock is exceptionally optimistic. All eight analysts covering the stock recommend buying it, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target is $202.25, indicating a potential upside of 2.93% based on the latest share price. In summary, I believe that during crypto bull markets, investors who are bullish on Bitcoin should consider a position in MicroStrategy. This approach makes sense because MicroStrategy’s use of debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings has been effectively executed, potentially leading to outperformance relative to both the market and the currency itself. Therefore, I view MicroStrategy as a Buy. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with strong volatility, as fluctuating Bitcoin prices can quickly alter the short- to medium-term outlook.

Delivered every Thursday straight to your inbox, it’s a must-read for those looking to stay inspired. Click here to get on the newsletter list! Hey ForbesBLK, Ayisha Mendez here. Did you know that Black women are the fastest growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the United States? Out of the 2.7 million businesses nationwide, 61% are self-funded, according to the Harvard Business Review. This is largely due to the lack of access to capital, exacerbated by the fact that less than 1% of venture capital dollars go to female founders. One ForbesBLK community member taking this head on is Genever Oppong, a private equity associate at BlackRock. She has witnessed firsthand the transformative effects of directing capital toward under-resourced communities of color. And emphasized that, “Together, we can shine a spotlight on the intersection of capital and community, showcasing how strategic investments in Black founders and investors can lead to transformative outcomes.” For Black Business Month, we did just that by joining forces with Genever’s network of Black Women Investors (BWI) and Tonna Obaze from Tonna&Co, for the State of Capital event aimed at providing strategies to access capital. This gathering brought together Black founders and funders to demystify venture capital and discuss equitable pathways to funding. During the event, panelist Stephany Ohaz, a Nigerian-American Investor whose pursuit of “finance for good” led her to impact investing, shared insights on how capital can be used as an agent of change. One of those impact recipients is Abena Boamah-Acheampong, founder of Hanahana Beauty, known as the, “Skincare Entrepreneur (Who) Is Giving Her Customers Equity In The Brand.” Her advice for those seeking capital is to, “look for people who have aligned incentives with you” and to prioritize building a supportive community – not just within your consumer base but also among those who can foster your growth. State of Black Capital by Marvin Lloyd “It’s also possible that VC funding is not the right fit for your business... and that’s OK,” explained Wilglory Tanjong, founder Amina Iris, known for its “Beyonce-approved” bags. During a live workshop led by Atlanta entrepreneur and local advisor, Yaminah Childress, members explored alternative ways to secure capital through the grant writing process. Events like this highlight the vital role community, training and networking play in fostering financial empowerment and establishing strategies for advancing capital.

Title: Dell staffers scramble to find childcare after 5-days-a-week office mandate gives just a few days’ notice: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/business/dell-staffers-forced-to-return-to-office-on-short-notice-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:16:39Z
Full Content:
Dell sent staffers into a panic last week by mandating they return to the office five days a week – on just a few days’ notice, according to a report. The Round Rock, Texas-based tech company sent its sales team a memo on Sept. 26, a Thursday, mandating employees return to full-time, in-person work starting that Monday, according to a Business Insider report. “The expectation is that ALL Global Sales team members who can work from a Dell office be on-site five days a week, regardless of role,” the internal memo from sales chiefs Bill Scannell and John Byrne said, according to BI. Parents ran into roadblocks as they scrambled to find last-minute childcare on Thursday night and discovered that after-school programs were already fully booked. “The biggest thing that I saw from just being in the office that day was parents freaking out,” a Dell sales employee told BI. “It’s one thing to already have childcare set up and already having to pay that crazy amount, but having a weekend to figure it out …” Scannell and Byrne acknowledged in the memo that workers “may need some time to make new arrangements,” but they did not provide details or specific accommodations that could be made, the report said. “We continually evolve our business so we’re set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners,” a Dell spokesperson told The Post. “That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership.” Dell is the latest major company to force its employees to resume in-office work – echoing mandates this year from companies like Amazon, Salesforce and PricewaterhouseCoopers. But Dell’s mandate comes as a particular shock to its salespeople, who were told in February they could choose between hybrid or remote work. The hybrid policy took effect in May. Hybrid staffers needed to be in the office about three days a week. Though the software giant tracked employee attendance, the hybrid policy was fairly flexible. Many employees left the office at lunchtime and worked from home the rest of the day, Dell workers told BI. One Dell salesperson told BI they started searching for childcare options on Thursday night, but found programs were already filled for the year. “They have to have all these finalized before the year starts, and the next enrollment isn’t until December or even when summer starts,” the employee said. “I’m on a waiting list, and I don’t have an option to put these kids in full time.” Two other Dell employees said they were facing the same problem while trying to find childcare. Another Dell employee said they used to leave the office at lunchtime to help their partner manage school pick-up times. They said their managers had been flexible and their productivity had not fallen since switching to hybrid work. The worker discussed their concerns about the in-office mandate with managers and Dell’s Human Resources department, who told the worker to use PTO when they could not work during work hours. “It wasn’t clarified if I can log back in at home after or if I’m expected to come back,” the employee said. Dell staffers told BI the office and its parking lots were packed one week into the policy. Employees said they were worried about running through their PTO while trying to balance the new mandate. “If we run out of that PTO, then we’re facing disciplinary actions,” one worker said. “It’s very disheartening. It makes me really not trust the company.” Multiple employees said they had heard from managers that the policy would be rolled out to other departments, but they were unsure when. One Dell worker said a senior leader told them last week that the return-to-office mandate might be required “because that’s what Amazon is doing.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy issued a full-time, return-to-office mandate a week before Dell’s policy. But Amazon staffers have until January to make the change. The in-person mandate is an effort on Amazon’s part to foster collaboration seen pre-pandemic, making it easier for teammates to “learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” Jassy said in a note. Some 91% of Amazon workers are dissatisfied with the mandate and a whopping 73% said they are considering looking for another job, according to a survey conducted by professional social network Blind. Amazon may be viewing the uproar as a success, as some have speculated the mandate is an effort to reduce headcount without issuing widespread layoffs. Advertisement

Title: Nvidia wants to drive AI costs down as 'reasoning' models rise

Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips have been a driver of the current artificial intelligence boom — and the chipmaker only wants to make it move faster, chief executive Jensen Huang said. During an appearance on the Tech Unheard podcast, Huang was asked by host Rene Haas, chief executive of British semiconductor company Arm (ARM), if the pace of AI innovation is moving “faster than you imagined.” Huang replied, “No,” and said Nvidia is “trying to make it go faster.” “We’ve gone to a one-year cycle,” Huang said about the company’s production of new chips. “And the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast.” Nvidia is designing “six or seven new chips per system,” Huang said, then using “co-design to reinvent the entire system” and inventing other technologies that allow it to improve performance by two or three times while using the same amount of energy and cost each year. “That’s another way of, essentially, reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year,” Huang said. “That is way faster than Moore’s Law.” Over the next few years, Huang said, Nvidia wants to drive down the cost of AI amid the rise of even more complex models. This evolution is already underway. In September, OpenAI released a new series of “reasoning” AI models called o1, which are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the way humans do. In the future, AI services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Huang said he uses every day, will “iteratively reason about the answer” and could go through hundreds or thousands of inferences before producing an output. This level of complex processing would require significantly more computational power than current models. Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile. “[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,” Huang said. “We want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.” On Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June. The chipmaker’s shares were down 0.27% during midday trading, but opened up almost 1% at around $134 per share.

Title: Hedera Analyst Thinks HBAR Will Easily 30X After Sinking 70% In 6 Months
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/hedera-hbar-30x-sinking-70-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:00:15Z

Hedera, a proof-of-stake platform, wasn’t spared from aggressive bears in early October. After HBAR, its native token, floated higher in September, the rejection of bulls in early October resulted in a double top. Overall, there is optimism that bulls will resume and push prices to new Q4 2024 highs. The pace of this growth will depend on how the market performs and whether fundamental factors around the project will prop up buyers. While there are cracks in the HBAR price action, considering the dump from April highs of around $0.18, one analyst on X thinks the token is set for major gains. From his assessment, Hedera can easily score 30X in the coming sessions, mirroring the gains posted by Cardano in the last cycle. Then, ADA soared by over 170X. If HBAR is to follow the same path, the token can easily soar to $6, over 60X from its 2024 highs. Presently, technical candlestick arrangements favor sellers. After the rally to $0.18 in April 2024, HBAR has been falling. To put the numbers into perspective, the token is down 70% but is stable after finding support in August and September. The local resistance is the double top at around September highs. If prices break above this liquidation zone, HBAR bulls could embark on the journey to drive the coin to $0.18. In effect, this will resume the uptrend set in motion in Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. There are fundamental factors to consider that may propel HBAR, helping the token shake off weaknesses. Early this month, Canary Capital released the first United States HBAR Trust. Like Grayscale products, including the ETHE and GBTC, the HBAR Trust allows institutional investors to gain exposure to HBAR. Accordingly, this could drive demand, lifting prices. In September, Hedera launched the Asset Tokenization studio. Through this solution, the network would be at the forefront of driving the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) while adhering to existing laws. Already, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, believes tokenization will rapidly grow in the coming years, managing trillions. According to rwa.xyz, over $12.7 billion worth of RWAs has been tokenized. Additionally, there is interest. In the last month alone, the number of RWA holders rose to 68,929, a 4% increase. Most of these assets are tokenized on Ethereum and Stellar. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

Title: Reddit Stock Rises as Jefferies Calls Stock a 'Buy' on AI Strengths
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/reddit-stock-rises-as-jefferies-calls-stock-a-buy-on-ai-strengths-8725540
Time Published: 2024-10-09T16:57:54Z
Full Content:
Reddit (RDDT) shares climbed Wednesday after analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of the social media platform with a "buy" rating, citing its success within Google search results and its artificial intelligence (AI) use cases. The firm issued a price target of $90 per share, a 27% premium over Tuesday's closing price and well above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Reddit's user growth accelerated to 51% in the second quarter, the firm noted, its highest level in four years. A big reason for that is the success of a revamped web platform the company debuted last year, which has led to "deeper integration into Google search." The company's average revenue per user is actually well below rivals Pinterest (PINS) and Snapchat (SNAP), which suggests a "long runway for increased monetization," analysts said. Reddit’s large library of user posts are a valuable resource for companies developing generative AI models, Jefferies said. The company has established about $325 million in contract licensing revenue over the next three years, led by deals with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and OpenAI. Going forward, the firm suggested that partnerships with companies such as Amazon (AMZN) and Anthropic could be in the cards, which would mean more high-margin revenue streams. Shares of Reddit climbed about 2% intraday Wednesday and are up about 43% since the company's IPO in March.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock is aiming for a new all-time high close as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom. The stock traded flat midday Wednesday at $133. It previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Tuesday, rising 4% to $132.89. Shares are up 12% from last week. The stock’s climb has been fueled by a barrage of good news for the company. Wall Street analysts this week have reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia’s weeklong ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other positive news in the semiconductor sector Wednesday could help Nvidia stock achieve a new record close. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that it’s boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Here's how I would make a dream PS5 Pro setup this Prime Day
URL: https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/heres-how-i-would-make-a-dream-ps5-pro-setup-this-prime-day/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T16:08:45Z
Full Content:
Make your PS5 setup "pro", with or without the upgraded console When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As someone who reviews all sorts of PS5 accessories for a living, I would argue you can make a PS5 Pro setup without buying Sony's new $699 console. Sure, a new GPU that can use AI upscaling and generally fling better graphics at your display is nice, but I'd argue that quality-of-life updates through upgrading other parts of your gaming setup will make much more of a difference to you. Of course, with Prime Day PS5 deals going on at the same time as PS5 pre-orders, now is a great time to shop for either a new console or some new gaming hardware and accessories. Since I've been keeping tabs on both of these things, I thought it would be a great opportunity to sift through the digital storefronts, finding the very best PS5 accessories and upgrades. Now, I totally appreciate that if you bought all of the products in the list below, you'd probably run your bank account through the wringer, and at that point, you may even spend more than you would on a PS5 Pro. I've put together the list below because barring the TV I've picked out, I've had hands-on time with every single thing, and can attest to each one making a massive difference to my gaming time. Without further ado, here are the Prime Day deals I'd use to make a dream PS5 Pro setup. SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P | $179.99 $109 at Amazon Save $70 - I use this headset every time I boot up the PS5, and you can get it here at its lowest-ever price. It as previously down to $125 in September, but this extra discount makes it particularly tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want exceptional sound quality ✅ You want a simultaneous Bluetooth connection ✅ You don't use the USB-C port on your console for anything else. Don't buy it if: ❌ You want a wireless mixer Price check: Best Buy: $179.99 UK: £137.74 at Amazon If you sift through enough of my ramblings about gaming tech, you'll know that audio means a great deal to me when gaming. I'm a huge lover of video game soundtracks, and I also play a lot of Hunt: Showdown, a game where audio is paramount to success. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P is a great headset above all, conveying sound cues accurately and balancing the varying tones of soundtracks beautifully. The other reason I love this headset though, and would recommend it at this price, is because it has simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity. That means that while your headset is connected to the PS5 or a PC through the wireless USB-C dongle, you can also connect your phone to it through Bluetooth. When you're scrolling through your phone while a game loads or you're taking a break, the audio will come through your headset at the same time. It's a huge quality-of-life feature I now don't want to go without. Corsair MP600 Elite 1TB | $99.99 $84.99 at Amazon Save $15 - If a storage upgrade would be more beneficial, this 1TB drive is the deal I'd make the most of this Prime Day. For being one of the best drives on the market, this really is a great price to pay. Buy it if: ✅ You want a top-performing SSD ✅ You need more storage space ✅ You'd like something that's simple to install Don't buy it if: ❌ You've pre-ordered the PS5 Pro Price check: Walmart: $84.99 UK: £97.99 at Amazon The PS5 Pro comes with a 2TB internal drive, which is nice, but it seems a bit pointless to me. The best SSDs for PS5 already exist, and you can usually find another 1TB drive to slot into an existing console without spending $100. The Corsair MP600 Elite is one of the first drives I'd recommend to PS5 owners this year. It outperforms the majority of other compatible options for this console, and it has one of the best integrated heatsinks I've come across. As true as that is, you can still get it for the price of the budget brands, thanks to this deal. If you just want an extra terabyte of space so you don't need to keep deleting games, this is the one I'd point you toward. If you want some serious future-proofing, on the other hand, check out the drive below. Samsung 990 Pro 4TB | $479.99 $265.99 at Amazon Save over $200 - Over $200 is a lot of money to spend on a small accessory for PS5. However, 4TB of space will last you for years to come, even if you download pretty much everything that gets added to PlayStation Plus every month. I've never seen this drive so cheap, so it's an amazing time to buy. Buy it if: ✅ You want to upgrade your storage ✅ You genuinely need 4TB ✅ You want the best SSD going Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't care about read/write speeds UK: £284.18 at Amazon The 4TB Samsung 990 Pro is the drive I use in my own console, and yes, it is arguably overkill. Still, its probably the best performing SSD out there at the moment. It's certainly the best one you can get for the PS5 because of its relentless speed. The majority of people don't actually need 4TB, but if you're building the setup of dreams, that will usually involve never needing to upgrade again. PSVR 2 | $549 $494.99 at Walmart Save $100 - I wasn't sure we'd see PSVR 2 get more price cuts this year after a big Days of Play discount brought it down by $100 during the summer. This is a really nice way to get it a bit cheaper if you missed that price though. Buy it if: ✅ You like VR gaming ✅ You have a gaming PC or PS5 ✅ You have the space to use it Don't buy it if: ❌ VR gaming makes you feel unwell Price check: Amazon: $529 | Best Buy: $549.99 UK: £495 at Amazon PSVR 2 is one of my favorite bits of gaming hardware. I know it isn't exactly a cheap upgrade for an existing PS5 owner, but it is probably one of the best ways to enjoy your console. VR gaming isn't for everyone, but this is arguably one of the best things about the PS5 because it adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to a platform that's struggled to put out first-party titles consistently. If you're at all interested in making the perfect PS5 setup, the best VR headset on the market right now has to be on your radar. GameSir G8 Galileo | $79.99 $61.59 at Amazon Save $18 - This mobile controller is more comfortable and more useful than a Backbone one. It also costs less money - especially in this deal. I'd recommend it any day of the week, but with an $18 reduction, it's even more tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want to play PS5 Remote Play ✅ You have larger hands ✅ You want back buttons Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't have a USB-C phone UK: £59.99 at Amazon The GameSir G8 Galileo is the best mobile controller right now, and it'll save you a lot more money than if you were to buy the PlayStation Portal. I'm not sure it should be able to, but the G8 can be used for PS5 Remote Play, which is incredible for a non-officially licensed controller. If you ever take your gaming sessions on the go, the GameSir G8 Galileo is the best PS controller you had no idea existed. Victrix Pro BFG wireless controller in white | $179.99 $154.99 at Amazon Save $35 - A 20% discount is exclusive to the white colorway of this controller, but it's a total steal if you're looking for an amazingly versatile PS5 controller.

It's cheaper, more versatile, and offers so much more utility than any of its rivals. If you want "pro" level gameplay, a controller like this is your key to unlocking it. If you take any game seriously enough to get "sweaty" about online leaderboards, or you even want to improve your K/D ratio in a casual shooter, this gamepad will make it so much easier for you. The Victrix Pro BFG has a modular design, meaning those facial parts? They can be pulled out and flipped upside down, which puts to bed that old debate about whether offset or symmetrical thumbstick layouts are better. Enjoy what you like, and change it around depending on the game you play - the BFG will let you do whatever you like. LG OLED C4 48-inch | $1,599.99 $996.99 at Amazon Save $203 - The LG OLED C4 is one of the best gaming TVs of the year, and if you go for a smaller size, you can get it under a grand right now.

Buy it if: ✅You want one of the latest OLED TVs ✅You need faster 120Hz visuals ✅You prioritise contrast and color Don't buy it if: ❌You’d rather find a C3 for less ❌You want a brighter mini-LED model Other available sizes: 📺42-inch - $1,096.99 $896.99 at Amazon 📺55-inch - $1,999.99 $1,296.99 at Amazon 📺65-inch - $2,699.99 $1,496.99 at Amazon 📺77-inch - $3,699.99 $2,496.99 at Amazon 📺83-inch - $5,399.99 $3.996.39 at Amazon Last, but certainly not least, is the TV I would be buying today if I didn't have a car to finish paying off. The LG OLED C4 is the latest in a long line of best gaming TV models produced by the brand. For years I've been envious of my older cousin who has had these TVs. Beyond going for silly money G Series OLEDs from LG, this is the perfect display for PS5 or PS5 Pro. 120Hz refresh rates can boost games to much smoother performance levels, 4x HDMI 2.1 ports mean you never need to swap out cables again, and a solid processor and OS make it a responsive Smart TV for viewing other content. I could honestly gush about these TVs all day long, but I don't want to delay you from buying if you can afford one, because these things go out of stock fast. While they're around, make the most of Prime Day gaming deals, Prime Day PC deals, and Prime Day Meta Quest deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Ever since playing Journey at the age of 15, I’ve been desperate to cover video games for a living. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship over at Expert Reviews. Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, said there’s been a surge in active Bitcoin addresses—up by 39% over the past week. That signals increased demand and liquidity, he said. Otychenko also noted a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s Network Value to Metcalfe Ratio (NVM). NVM measures the relationship between Bitcoin's market value and the activity on its network, indicating potential under- or overvaluation. And now, the Bitcoin NVM is at levels not seen since its all-time high—suggesting the cryptocurrency could be trading below its intrinsic value. "Historically, when active addresses surge like this, it often precedes or accompanies price increases," Otychenko told Decrypt. The NVM metric has been a reliable indicator in the past, as it did in late 2022 and September 2023, when BTC saw price recoveries following similar drops in NVM, he added. Currently, Bitcoin is trading down 0.6% at $62,120, struggling to maintain levels above key technical indicators. It remains sandwiched between the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA, a situation that mirrors price action from October 2023. For the cryptocurrency to break out of this consolidation, a move above the 200-day SMA with higher trading volume is essential. "Bitcoin needs to push above the 200-day SMA and sustain those levels to see further upward momentum," Otychenko said. However, the gains over the past week have come with decreasing volume, suggesting a lack of strong bullish momentum. On a broader level, analysts like Brian Dixon, CEO of OTC Capital, are rethinking Bitcoin’s traditional characterization as a purely risk-on asset. "Recent analyses, including from major financial institutions like BlackRock, are challenging the view of Bitcoin as only a risk asset," Dixon told Decrypt. He highlighted the evolving narrative of BTC behaving more like gold during economic downturns, pointing to its potential role as a risk-differentiated or even risk-off asset. This shift could redefine Bitcoin’s position in investment portfolios, making it a more attractive option for long-term diversification. "Bitcoin might offer protection against market volatility in ways that traditional assets might not," Dixon added, furthering the case for its adoption as a hedge against traditional market downturns. In terms of institutional flows, Bitcoin ETFs have seen mixed results. On Tuesday, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $18.6 million, with the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) leading the outflows at $48.8 million. However, the BlackRock ETF (IBIT) saw an inflow of $39.5 million on the same day. Spot ETFs that track Ethereum, which has remained relatively stable, saw a total net outflow of $8.1 million from spot ETFs on October 8, data from SoSo Value shows. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price BTC was trading down 0.6% at $62,050 and Ether is trading flat at $2,432, according to data from CoinGecko. BTC's immediate price action remains contingent on upcoming macroeconomic data. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, noted that the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes and the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data could serve as triggers for Bitcoin’s next move. "Potential triggers to break out of this range could be Fed minutes or U.S. inflation data if they lead to a reassessment of expectations in traditional markets," Kuptsikevich said, in a note to Decrypt.

Title: The 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover 11 Best States to Retire and Offset this Gap

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/09/2024 7:58:39 AM PDT by Red Badger This article looks at the 2025 Social Security COLA falls short: discover 11 best states to retire and offset the gap. You may skip our detailed analysis and jump to 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover the 5 Best States to Retire and Offset the Gap. 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination.

Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

You do save on no state taxes and property taxes, but everything else is very costly. 3 posted on 10/09/2024 8:17:37 AM PDT by napscoordinator (DeSantis is a beast!

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country.

I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4.

South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years.

Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US.

For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area.

Title: Nvidia's stock is breaking out, Fairlead Strategies says

Full Content:
AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. "Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141)," Stockton said. "While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics." NVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date. Analysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing "insane" demand. "Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane," Huang said on CNBC's last week. "Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first." Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip. On Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.

AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. "Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141)," Stockton said. "While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics." NVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date. Analysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing "insane" demand. "Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane," Huang said on CNBC's last week. "Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first." Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip. On Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.

Title: 2 Big Dividends To Buy As Inflation Returns

Inflation Graphic to illustrate strong rising inflation. 3D illustration Another day, another sign the economy is heading straight for that “no-landing” scenario I’ve been talking about for weeks now … … and yet another sign the two dividends we’re going to discuss today are better buys than they’ve been in months. (One of these staunch payers kicks out a rich 8% divvie. The other has grown its dividend a ridiculous 425% in the last five years. A buy back then would be kicking out a sweet 6.2% dividend today, thanks to that breakneck growth!) When you hear “no landing,” your first impression might be that it sounds like a good thing, right? After all, it implies the economy will keep humming along, and that recession we’ve been worrying about since, well, 2020, will keep being pushed back. All good. Except here’s the rub: Inflation comes back. I mean, when you have a federal government spending nearly $2 trillion more than it’s taking in, it’s easy to see how this monetary inflation could seep into consumer price inflation. And there’s no way an extra $2 trillion dropping into the system isn’t going to juice the economy! No matter who wins the election, I think we can all agree that this spending is unlikely to be tamed. The opposite, in fact—fueling inflation even more. A quick look at the headlines brings more warnings of a potential resurgence of inflation: An expanding war in the Middle East, for example, has been pushing up oil prices. And even though the port workers’ strike has been settled, it reminds us how easily our supply chains can be disrupted. And of course we had last week’s blowout jobs report, which showed continued strong wage growth. Jay Powell seems to see this inflationary wave rolling in. Last week, he tamped down expectations of more jumbo rate cuts, like the 50-pointer the Fed dropped last month. Futures markets agree—they now point to just 75 basis points in cuts between now and the Fed’s last meeting of the year, on December 18. So where does that leave us? We’re looking to buy dividends that ride this growing economy while profiting from inflation’s return. That setup points straight to one sector: natural gas stocks. There are two other reasons to buy “natty” stocks now, too. First, there’s the massive stimulus plan China announced a little over a week ago. That’s likely to spur gas demand, as China is the biggest importer, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The other factor working in our favor is gas’s tendency to hit its $2 “price floor” and bounce—exactly what it’s doing now. A price that’s bottomed and has momentum? That’s typically a great time to buy. So let’s dive into those two dividends I mentioned off the top, starting with our 8% payer. At times like these, with energy prices still low but moving up, we look to the 8% dividend kicked out by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP Alerian MLP ETF ), which holds the shares of energy infrastructure companies. These firms—master limited partnerships (MLPs), to be exact—collect tolls on the oil and gas that moves through their lines and sits in their storage tanks. MLPs make money in all energy seasons, but it’s much better to own them when prices are at least steady or better yet rising, to snag price upside and sweet dividend payouts. When oil and gas prices (and shipping volumes) rise, the pipeline stocks AMLP owns boost their dividends. That’s resulted in a steady grind higher for the fund’s payout: AMLP Dividend Best of all, AMLP’s rising payout pulls its price up—a phenomenon I call the “Dividend Magnet.” The pattern is unmistakable: AMLP Dividend Magnet So where does that leave us? With an 8% “starter” yield that’s set to grow on a buy made today, as our “no-landing” setup pushes commodity demand (and prices) higher. Oh, and a share price poised to ride right along with it, too. By the way, buying MLPs through AMLP also eliminates one of the headaches of buying MLPs “direct”: complicated tax reporting. AMLP’s top holding, Plains All-American Pipeline LP (PAA), kicks you a fussy K-1 form at tax time, which is a hassle for you or the pro who files your taxes. (Trust me, I once got a firm talking-to from my accountant after buying MLPs a few years ago.) But buy through AMLP and voila, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your dividends received. Which, of course, dishes that elite 8%. When natural gas is in the early stages of a rally, EQT Corp. (EQT) is my “go to” stock. The company boasts nearly 4,000 drilling locations—and the lowest breakeven costs in the industry. (Names hidden in the chart below to protect the less profitable!) FCF Breakeven The prices above indicate at what level the company’s gas is profitable to drill. Notice that EQT leads the pack overall. What’s more, the company is tightening its grip on the prolific Appalachian Basin through its recently completed $14-billion acquisition of Equitrans Midstream, its former midstream business, which adds 3,700 miles of pipeline, plus storage assets. EQT sees the move resulting in $425 million in cost savings (The firm also recently cut its workforce by 15%). It also nicely positions EQT as it moves to boost production after last winter no-showed in large parts of the country, hitting gas prices. Remember, too, that natural gas is the least offensive of the fossil fuels, which gives it long-term upside as a “transition” fuel as the world shifts toward renewables. NatGas Demand Growth Which brings us back to the Dividend Magnet. For months and even a few years, tickers can meander independently of their dividends. But eventually, they do follow their payouts higher like a puppy dog. EQT’s dividend has leaped above its stock, putting a strong pull on its price: EQT Dividend Magnet Even if I’m wrong with my “no-landing” call, all signs point to this one winning anyway. The stock is still well off its 2022 peak, its dividend is on a tear, and natgas production is about to ramp up, thanks in part to surging power demand from energy transition. That makes now a great time to buy EQT—and its charged-up Dividend Magnet. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are nearing their all-time highs Wednesday morning on positive news about the chipmaker's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Nvidia shares, which have ended higher the past five sessions, recently edged up to $133.30. Their all-time closing high is $135.58, achieved on June 18, and record intraday high is $140.76, recorded the following session two days later, after markets were closed for Juneteenth. On Tuesday, contract electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn reported strong demand for its servers powered by Nvidia's GB200 semiconductors, part of the latter's Blackwell architecture. Microsoft announced it was "the 1st cloud" running the Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. OpenAI also thanked Nvidia for delivering "one of the first engineering builds of the DGX B200 to our office." Also yesterday, Nvidia noted that the Blackwell platform has slashed energy consumption by up to 2,000 times over the last decade for AI training models such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Bob Pette, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's enterprise platforms, told participants at the company's AI Summit that "We are in the dawn of a new industrial revolution," adding that the firm is "designing our systems with not just performance in mind, but with energy efficiency in mind." Nvidia shares have soared about 170% this year. TradingView

September sales rose at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), with the chipmaker on Wednesday reporting numbers that pointed toward better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported September sales of 251.87 billion New Taiwan dollars ($7.82 billion), up just under 40% from the same time last year. Added to its results for August and July, TSMC reported NT$759.69 billion ($23.58 billion) in revenue for the third quarter, above the NT$749.88 billion analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had expected and roughly 36% above sales for the third quarter of 2023. The results surpassed TSMC's own outlook, as the company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expected third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company's US-traded shares were recently down more than 1% as broader markets wavered. The stock has risen steadily from August lows and is near record levels, up roughly 75% this year. The PHLX index of semiconductor shares edged lower Thursday. TSMC is set to report the rest of its third-quarter financial results on the morning of Oct. 17. The company surpassed estimates in the first two quarters of 2024, as demand for its chips to power AI technology have remained in high demand.

Nvidia stock seems to be climbing back to its record high close from June. The AI chipmaker’s stock was up almost 1% at the open on Wednesday, to about $134 per share. It later fell to about $133 per share. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at almost $133 the day before. Nvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) again. During Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. In June, Nvidia’s shares closed at a record high $135.58, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Since then, its shares have experienced some turbulence, but the company’s stock is still up 173.4% so far this year. Compared to a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up 192%. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters. Compared to a year ago, TSMC’s revenue grew 36.5%, Reuters calculated. In July, the chipmaker said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $22.4 billion and 23.2 billion.

On Wednesday, KeyBanc raised the stock price target for Pinterest Inc (NYSE: NYSE:PINS) to $45 from the previous $43, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. The adjustment follows the firm's assessment that Pinterest presents significant growth potential ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The company's favorable position is attributed to multiple factors. Foreign exchange rates are seen as increasingly beneficial, user engagement remains strong, and new product developments are on the horizon. One such development, Performance+, is expected to simplify campaign management on the platform. Drawing parallels to similar offerings from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), the analyst anticipates that Performance+ could spur sustained growth for Pinterest over the coming years. Despite challenges in the food and beverage sector, Pinterest is expected to overcome these as it moves past the comparative period in the fourth quarter. This year also marks the first holiday season where Pinterest will benefit from monetization efforts with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google. These initiatives, combined with a disciplined approach to expenses, are projected to result in at least 300 basis points of annual margin expansion. The firm's outlook is further bolstered by the current market valuation of Pinterest shares. With the stock trading at multiples of 15.6x and 12.2x the estimated enterprise value to EBITDA for 2025 and 2026, respectively, the analyst suggests that the market may be underestimating Pinterest's growth trajectory. In other recent news, Pinterest has been the subject of several analyst reviews. Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Pinterest, emphasizing the company's potential for high-teen growth rates and margin expansion. BofA Securities also reiterated a Buy rating on Pinterest shares, highlighting the company's ongoing integration of AI technology and its potential to achieve double-digit core growth by 2025. Deutsche Bank upgraded Pinterest's stock rating from Hold to Buy, citing the potential of its affluent user base and projected a 6% compound annual growth rate for Pinterest's global monthly active users with an 18% revenue growth over the next three years. Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Pinterest with an Outperform rating, emphasizing the platform's unique position in the digital advertising space. The firm also noted Pinterest as the fastest-growing digital advertising platform. Baird reiterated an Outperform rating, focusing on the platform's potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. These are recent developments for Pinterest, a company that has also been working on expanding its operations. The third quarter of 2024 is expected to be the first complete quarter to reflect the revenue impact of the company's expansion efforts, which included the monetization of approximately 30 new countries through Google's platform. Pinterest's referral traffic from Amazon showed a notable increase in September, surging 148% year-over-year. The company's recent global advertising event, Pinterest Presents, showcased the platform's advancements and potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. Recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to KeyBanc's optimistic outlook on Pinterest. As of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024, Pinterest's revenue grew by 16.22%, reaching $3.34 billion. This growth aligns with KeyBanc's expectations of significant potential for the company. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Pinterest's net income is expected to grow this year, supporting the analyst's projection of margin expansion. The company's strong financial position is further evidenced by the fact that it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, potentially providing flexibility for future investments in product development and growth initiatives. It is worth noting that while Pinterest is trading at a high P/E ratio of 115.63, it's also trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.71. This suggests that the market may indeed be undervaluing Pinterest's growth prospects, as KeyBanc pointed out. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Pinterest, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Liskov’s Gun: The parallel evolution of React and Web Components – Baldur Bjarnason

Web dev at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland Because this essay is over 11 000 words long(!) I’ve made a convenience EPUB file for offline reading. (EPUB only! No PDF this time.) You can download it over on the fulfilment service I use, Lemon Squeezy, with the option to pay what you want if you feel the urge to support my writing. Paying is absolutely optional. Unless you’re like me – an “extremely online” kind of web developer – you probably don’t notice the dramas and brouhahas that erupt in the web developer community with regularity. Most of the time these flame-wars offer little of value or less in terms of technical insight and the patter of angry voices fades away before it reaches the ears of the less online. But a recent one, which began when the maintainer of the SolidJS web development framework wrote a long and very angry-sounding blog post outlining why he didn’t think web components represented the future of web development, is a little bit less usual. Not because it has staying power. It’s fading away at the same steady pace as these things usually do. It’s interesting because it touches on what I think is a genuinely interesting technical issue, but in a way that pretty much forces every reader to ignore it. Normally, these “debates” are free of useful information. Often it’s somebody railing against this or that for largely personal reasons – I’ve certainly been guilty of that. Other times the points being made on both sides are largely innocuous. The people involved just seem to be using their “outside voices”, metaphorically speaking, for no particular reason. “You should write tests!” “Yes, but you need to do it properly! Otherwise, they just get in the way!” “I AGREE BUT I PHRASE IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME SOUND ANGRY AT YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE INTERNET AND I’M PROBABLY ANGRY AT SOMETHING!” It’s tiresome, especially because it’s common for this mode of debating to split people who are largely in agreement into groups that chalk each other up as assholes. The worst part being that both sides are generally true. Everybody involved had an asshole moment or two. What makes the web components debate interesting is that, this being the internet, many of the participants are behaving like assholes (though not you, dear reader, you’re one of the wonderful sensible few of the internet) while at the same time making interesting yet conflicting technical points. “These two groups seem to both be making solid technical points, and yet they end up disagreeing,” is always interesting. It means the topic has curious nuances and, possibly, unresolved hard questions. That bit is genuinely fun, at least if you’re of a personality type that finds unresolved hard questions fun. The tone and attitudes of some of the posts involved make it difficult, but discovering if there’s a “there” there can be worthwhile. But, because of the “everybody defaults to ‘asshole’” nature of social media, we often end up in a discourse archipelago where each island vehemently sticks to its opinions, never listening to the other, because most humans will resolutely ignore advice and observations if they come from somebody they consider to be an asshole. The core point of the current hubbub, if you dig through the rhetoric and follow the links back to earlier discussions and arguments is: It’s really hard to add extensibility and “composability” to an already complex class inheritance tree with pre-existing and rigidly defined composition system without making some hard compromises. But to get to that point, the point where we can dig into the technical details of the whys and wherefores, we first need to understand the context. We need to be able to look past the assholes to see the forest. We need to understand what somebody means when they say “web components”. If you aren’t directly involved in specific kinds of web development, you might not have a clear idea of what Web Components are. They are a set of web APIs that have been standardised and, for the most part, implemented by web browsers. They are a standard method for implementing and distributing reusable widgets. That’s pretty much it. There are a few features and details that surround these, help them integrate with other APIs, help smooth the edges, but this is Web Components. Together, these APIs let us build custom widgets that can be safely packaged into a custom element and will interoperate with pretty much anything that renders to a DOM, even React (though React specifically blocked custom elements for what honestly sounded like spurious reasons for the longest time and even now full support has only shipped in a beta release). Web Components aren’t what you would call a “disruptive” innovation, but they are genuinely useful. More so now they more reliably work with forms in modern browsers. They are a “hey, you know that thing browsers do? Well now you can do a little bit of that yourself” kind of extension mechanism. Slightly complicating the issue, the term tends to get reused across a few contexts. This last type of project is the one that’s of most interest to those in software development who might have to do some incidental web development. Because of how late Safari was to supporting form-associated custom elements, we’re only in the early stages of what Web Component Libraries can offer, but they have the potential to provide ready-made yet powerful and customisable widgets people could use when making websites, services, or web apps, no matter what client-side or server-side framework they’re using. Described this way, you might wonder how an otherwise innocuous set of web APIs, designed to aid in the making of reusable widgets, so consistently cause tension and conflict among web developers. So much so that it’s almost certainly a very bad idea for me to wade into it with this essay. Why do Web Components cause online web developer communities to erupt in anger and argument? To answer that, we need to go back over a decade, at least thirteen years, all the way back to 2011. The impression you’re likely to get from discussions online would be that web components were created as a reaction to the rampant growth of React-based frameworks bloating websites and breaking accessibility. You couldn’t be faulted for thinking that web component APIs came about as a proposed fix. “Stop using React and use these APIs, they come with the web!” But web components not only predate the popular misuse of React and the rise of frameworks, they arguably predate React itself. Web components surfaced to public view in 2011 in a talk at the Fronteers conference by Alex Russell. These weren’t the web components you see today as the code he was presenting was a library, not a proposed standard – that would come later – but the shape of it is extremely familiar to those who have used modern Web Components. React at this point was still an internal project at Facebook and had only been in use for a few months, if that. These were two very different approaches towards creating dynamic web-based user interfaces, and they were as good as invented simultaneously. Their launch as public projects also happened at pretty much the same time with Google’s first attempt to standardise Web Components and Facebook’s first launch of React as an open source project both happening in 2013. This was, in my personal opinion, the point where multiple schisms in web development began to happen, the break that has hindered web developer discourse since. I should emphasise here that the following description of events is my opinion only and entirely based on what I saw as an outside observer. I was not privy to any private discussions or chats. I absolutely missed out on some important context, but I can say that this is what it looked like to a lot of people at the time. I appreciate that everybody involved meant well and had good reasons for their behaviour, but people will form their opinion of you based on what they know and see, which doesn’t include the stuff they don’t know about, and especially doesn’t include the stuff you haven’t made public. People do not read between the lines on the internet. At best, they make weird shit up and pretend it’s true. Web Components at this point were, and I know quite a few people will again disagree with me, an entirely proprietary Google project, much like React was an entirely proprietary Facebook project. Web components during these first three years, the first iteration that later got called “Web Components v0”, were only ever implemented by Google, only promoted by Google, and its biggest users were Google products and frameworks. The “polyfills”, itself a term that implies inevitable standardisation, were from the perspective of everybody not using Google’s Chrome the actual implementation of Web Components. They were slow as hell. This made the overall experience of Google properties that used them, such as YouTube, noticeably worse in Firefox. Not a great look, folks! To make matters worse – and, again, this is based on my impressions at the time and I know plenty of people disagree with me – a few of the more “enthusiastic” Web Components promoters during these three years were parading around being absolute assholes, to an even greater degree than seemed normal in online developer circles. Many of them seemed to outright believe that a set of APIs made unilaterally by a single vendor would inevitably get railroaded unchanged into a standard – in and of itself a highly problematic idea – and talked about web components being “the future”, implying that every other approach, no matter how new, was “legacy” or somesuch. Remember, React and Web Components were both released at around the same time – arguably React came later – and here these dudes (almost always dudes) were strutting around calling everything else outdated and obsolete. They claimed to be the only ones properly “using the platform”. Their approach was “standard”. A “standard” implemented by a single browser, pushed by a single company, with no interest from other browsers visible to an outside observer for at least three years. This is arguably normal behaviour in tech, where a dev-rel’s thankless task of building up good vibes about an API or platform can be tanked thoroughly by a lead dev opening their mouth and managing to simultaneously piss everybody off in 140 characters dumped onto the hive of seething malice that used to be called Twitter. But, because none of us saw what may or may not have been going on behind the scenes, and because Google was even then at the very least a proto-monopolist… This all? It was not a great look! It didn’t help that React was in full promise-the-world myth-making mode. It no longer really mattered whether Web Components were superior to React or not. Web developers largely focused on React, which has always had more competent PR than most other open source projects. Another problem was that nobody else seemed to agree with Google that this specific iteration of Web Components was the future. Firefox and Safari never implemented version “zero” of Web Components. Most developers favoured React’s approach to reactive programming and composition which, arguably, became the conceptual inspiration for pretty much every reactive component framework implemented since. Everybody who adopted this version of Web Components ended up getting punished for trusting Google. To say that the Safari and Firefox teams were sceptical about web components is oversimplifying things. The template element was relatively uncontroversial compared to the rest. “Autonomous” custom elements – the ability to define brand-new elements with custom names (<my-custom-element>) – were also relatively uncontroversial. The Shadow DOM and “built-in” custom elements – letting web developers directly modify native built-in elements in situ through sub-classing – proved much more divisive. Many at the time seemed convinced that this reticence was nothing more than a form of road-blocking, that these Mozilla and Apple employees were obeying some sort of secret directive from their bosses to “slow-walk” improvements to the web, but a much simpler explanation is that their concern was genuine, because there was a lot to be concerned about. These particular changes affect the core of how the Document Object Model (DOM) works. The consequences of doing the wrong thing would be both long-lasting and far-reaching, and the web has much too many footguns already. Messing around with the composition and inheritance models of the DOM is something you should legitimately be hesitant to do. Those arguing for ill intent do have their smoking gun: Apple’s unwillingness to ship the awesome that would be built-in custom elements is, to many, clear evidence that Apple hates the web. That the rationale for doing so involved citing something so clearly bullshit-sounding as the “Liskov Substitution Principle” has frequently been mocked by web devs on social media. (Don’t laugh. Many web devs also think “Model-View-Controller”, “Separation of Concerns”, and “unit testing” sound like bullshit. The web software industry has a substantial curiosity deficit. Apologies for the “X” links, but that’s where nonsense lives, retires, and dies of old age after an active life.) But, for the purposes of this story, Liskov’s a different kind of gun: Checkov’s gun. And I’m not just saying that because I think “Liskov” sounds a bit like “Checkov” and it amuses me to link the two. This gun will be fired in the third act and not in the way the “WebKit developers hate the web” types think. It turns out the Safari team had a point. Looking from the outside in, like that creepy dude in the “Sickos” cartoon, the discussions at the time looked involved and intense. The GitHub issue with the infamous “Liskov” remark I linked to above is over 500 comments long, and it’s one of many, not to mention mailing list threads and, I presume, a bunch of calls and in person conversations. But, eventually, browser vendors settled on a design for Web Components. This “v1” of Web Components was quite incompatible with “v0”, punishing everybody who took Google at their word that their proprietary v0 would eventually become a web standard: And a bunch more changes that I won’t go into here, but suffice to say migrating from v0 to v1 was a painful process for many. Moving an existing code base that used the entire Web Component v0 stack to v1 was non-trivial. It took YouTube itself a long while to migrate. Having to drop v0 and having to redesign Web Components to address the concerns raised by Safari and Firefox did not make the more avid in the Web Components crowd humble or change their tone. If anything, from the perspective of a regular web developer (me, that is), their rhetoric seemed to escalate now they could point to Web Components being an actual standard. If you are a masochist, you should easily be able to find GitHub comments or Tweets from this period, the early years of Web Components from 2016 to 2020, where a Google employee is calling all other approaches “legacy code” or “legacy approaches” or something similar. If you were a lurker at the time in the discussion threads between them and framework implementers, you’d have noticed that their advocacy also seemed to become much more targeted. The pressure was on those making the newer web development frameworks to build them using web components, not just be compatible with them, and it looked immense. The targets of this pressure were not Facebook’s React here, but newer frameworks such as Solid and Svelte. These are made by folks that, by and large, are very much in favour of using standards if possible, whereas the React folks seem more inclined to go “meh” and do their own thing. These newer frameworks are generally much better behaved when it comes to interoperability, exposing native DOM APIs, and performance. Both Solid and Svelte even compile to Web Components meaning you can use them to implement reusable custom elements for your projects. The problem? These pro-web maintainers have differing definitions of what’s “possible” from those more avidly promoting web components. Some of that comes from the fact that Web Components seem to be largely unsuitable to implementing a functional reactive component framework, which should not be surprising since the two concepts evolved in parallel, not in sequence. It’d have been quite the coincidence if web components had happened to be a useful set of primitives for implementing something like Svelte or Solid. Quite a few of the people who build and maintain the frameworks themselves hold on to a lingering animosity because many of them feel gaslit about the capabilities of Web Components. Their perception of reality was that these standards were not useful to them at all, but the message they got – insistently – was that web components were the inevitable future of their own frameworks. This is the background that led Ryan Carniato, the author of SolidJS, to write his blog post Web Components Are Not the Future. That blog post is a reaction to a specific line of rhetoric that has gone unnoticed by most web developers because they were not the ones targeted. That’s why it looked like such an odd, angry, outburst to many and those foolish enough to support their chosen web development tech as if it were a football team took it or the reaction to it as validation that their “team” was better than the others. What’s missing from this are the reasons why React and its descendants won out over Web Components and their ecosystem. Just because you might not easily be able to use web components to implement something like SolidJS, that’s a very different kind of problem from what most regular web developers are tackling. Ryan might have a justifiable gripe against a small group of over-enthusiastic Web Components promoters, but that doesn’t answer the question that rises when you realise that React and Web Components are generationally peers – to the point of React having its first stable release in 2016 just like Web Components: Why did React win? And the answer to that, in my oh so personal opinion, isn’t “because Web Components aren’t great for specific kinds of problems, such as those framework maintainers deal with” no matter how technically reasonable that might sound. Remember, these technical observations and conclusions are popping up after React was well on its way towards resoundingly winning the popularity contest that is modern web dev. I think it comes down to a simple difference in promises. Web components promise you that you’ll be able to extend the DOM in ways that are idiomatically compatible in with the rest of the DOM. React promised us a silver bullet: unidirectional data flow would fix UI development once and for all. Magical silver bullets will always be more popular than boring old incremental improvement. React offered two benefits to organisations: Both of these promises are science-fiction, and experienced React devs as well as React maintainers are both likely to be the first to point that out. People still believed in these fictions, and many still do. Both require some explanation. React’s core innovation was to treat the UI as a virtual data structure that could be reconciled with, or rendered to, whatever stateful group of objects you were using to render the actual User Interface. This was deliberately agnostic about whether the rendering target was a Document Object Model, a hierarchy of AppKit or UIKit objects, or whatever it is that Android has got going. This meant you could structure your UI components as a set of functions or classes that together took the app’s state and returned a tree-like data structure and, because these were in theory just accepting and returning data, you could steal ideas from functional programming – immutable objects, no side effects, baby! – to make the whole process easier. Instead of complex manipulations full of potential side effects, your mental model of your GUI app would be something along the lines of: UI = f(state) Events and actions generated by the UI modify state. That triggers the f(state) part again. The data structure returned from the components is diffed with the existing UI and the UI is updated based on that diff to reflect the new state. This is what the React scene calls “unidirectional data flow” (“one-way data flow” in more recent documentation) because data only flows from state to UI, whereas the data that flows from the UI back into state is labelled “actions” or “events”, which means they aren’t data, silly. No, the data the user is typing into the form isn’t data. It’s an action. Here, read this rambling blog post and library of old-style Twitter threads that explain it. Of course, you need to be smart enough to understand that data isn’t data except when it’s data, and it’s always going in one direction except when it’s going in the other, in which case it’s a cycle, which makes it all one direction. Something about drawing it as a circle somehow makes people miss the fact that stuff is obviously flowing in multiple directions. Not just up and down, but sideways within a component and often React apps just completely drop the pretence and shove the data directly to where it belongs using things like the Context API. But, sure, the data only flows one way. You just need to have curious definitions of the words “flow”, “one”, “way”, and “data”. That, however, isn’t the problem with the idea. It’s actually a neat idea that forces you to rethink some of the basic principles of GUI software development. The problem is that it’s pretty much only an idea: a myth. What we get in practice is almost always quite different in very important ways. The issues, in no particular order: But, Baldur, you don’t understand! You don’t get React! Oh, I understand. When I use a model object that’s connected to a view object using a coordinating object (controller, presenter, or whatever), then sure that’s MVC or MVP. But, when you do it, it’s a parent component that’s using the context API and hooks to coordinate a state object with a functional child component. Effectively, as soon as you try to do meaningful work with React, the “unidirectional data flow” ceases to be an architecture and becomes an origin myth. Meanwhile the actual architecture is whatever uncoordinated “I can’t believe it’s not MVC” hocus pocus is popular in the React scene the week the project was started. For a very brief period, React’s tag line was something like “The V in MVC”, but they quickly gave that up because there’s so much more in React than just the components. They have an entire array of state and event management tools that together assemble whatever app architecture you want. React has always been the whole kit and caboodle, not just a “V”. It’s just never enforced a single, coherent architecture and instead provided hooks and tools with no direction and soft boundaries. But it promised magic, and people didn’t seem to notice that, in time, making and maintaining a React app was just as much work, if not more, as those made using more traditional approaches. Moreover, React apps that were explicitly structured using the Model-View-Controller architecture from the ground up tended to, in my personal opinion as an extremely biased outside observer, be less problematic over time than those that went all in on the unidirectional gravy train. A promise of magic is always going to be more popular than promising to give you sensible – the “wear practical shoes, it’s going to be a long walk” kind of sensible – steps forward. Even if Web Components had met with universal approval among browser vendors right out of the gate, it’s unlikely they would have ever won out over the promise of making the development of dynamic user interfaces magically easier. It should not be surprising that more modern component frameworks, ones that aren’t saddled with a largely fictional core concept, such as Vue, Svelte, or SolidJS are by almost every metric faster, lighter, and more productive than React. Preact even manages to be a far superior “React” than React itself. React has become a bloated carcass of false promises, misleading claims, and unending layers of backwards compatibility – the wrong kind of backwards compatibility, as they still occasionally break your fucking code when updating. Pretty much anything else is a better tool for pretty much any web development task. There’s also more genuinely useful innovation going on everywhere except React. SolidJS came up with signals, a genuinely interesting method for handling state. Preact adopted it and arguably came up with a more interoperable implementation of the idea. Vue and Svelte both hew closer to web norms in interesting ways. If you want innovation and experimentation, there’s a lot of it going around. Just not in React. Promises of magic only go so far. Since the consensus of the overall effect that React has had on the web is currently ranging from “on the whole, probably not great” to “the only thing that would be worse for the web would be a comet wiping out all civilisation, and even that would be a blessed relief,” if that were all, React would not be nearly as dominant in the web software industry as it still is today. That’s where commodifying developers comes in. In basic terms, what management wants is the ability to add, remove, or move around staff while pretending that said staff is largely interchangeable and that the moving around doesn’t mess things up in and of itself. This is the case for most modern companies, not just the ones in tech. Any form of expertise or specialisation makes that idea even more fictional than it already is. Employers generally love whatever scheme they find that can narrow the skill sets required to do a task down to something that can be clearly defined in market terms. One way to do that is by requiring specific degrees and certifications. Another is to standardise on using specific tools and platforms and hiring for those. You don’t try to hire people with good problem-solving skills, an ability for writing clearly, an affinity for numbers, or an understanding of how computers work that helps them pick up new apps quickly. You hire for skills in “Word” and “Excel”. That lets you hire quickly, fire quickly, and move people around as if they were, I don’t know, Legos or something. (Sorry, “Lego bricks”, he corrects himself before the pedants light their torches and grab their pitchforks.) This is hard to accomplish in software development. The entire job is basically discovering and solving poorly-defined problems with squishy human elements at its centre. React stepped in just in time to help managers en masse fake their way to a promotion during a low-interest-rate bubble. Much like “Word” and “Excel” have become the “fungibility” stand-ins for “can write clearly” and “understands numbers”, React has become a stand-in for “UI software development”. It hides the complexities of what’s happening underneath a layer of abstractions. Instead of learning a host of DOM querying and manipulation APIs or the workings of platforms like UIKit, you just return JSX. Instead of exposing the various nuances and intricacies of event handling on each platform, you get one form of event delegation and you’re going to like it. The JSX data structures are so abstracted away from the actual platform that they even offer approaches for you to pretend there isn’t any difference between a web, iOS, and Android app and let you target (or try to target) all with a single code base. React developers interact with a drastically simplified view of the world. Because that simplified view has limitations, the underlying platforms push their way into the job with alarming regularity. But because the point of hiring for React is to not hire people with the specialised skills to deal with the nuances of underlying platform, most of the time everybody reaches for a dependency instead. Something made by somebody with a deeper understanding of the underlying platform that packages up a set of solutions that those with full-on React blinkers can use. This heavy reliance on dependencies compounds React’s many pre-existing performance problems. The bloat of these web apps isn’t accidental but a by-product of how React is used by management. (I’ve written about this before, for those who are curious.) Understanding how the DOM works is a hard requirement for using tools to extend the DOM. This made Web Components a non-starter. Web Components didn’t help enable the massive growth in head count that drove much of the decision-making in tech from 2011-2022. Bear this in mind below, when I go into some of the technical limitations of Web Components. Those limitations are not the reasons why React won. React ended up the winner because it devalued software developers and made promises it could never fulfil. If that were all, then web components would just be a textbook case of over-aggressive promotion and hubris leading to self-sabotage, and a useful but limited technology losing out primarily because of the market’s many dysfunctions. Both are a regular occurrence in tech and software development. But has had other consequences. It has fractured the online web development community. The React-versus-everybody-else schism is obvious, but the other schisms are arguably more tragic. Specifically, drama surrounding Web Components and a steady parade of similar events has fractured the part of the community that is trying to get the industry to stop using what has now become the actual legacy framework: React. Instead of a united front that promotes a set of approaches as alternatives to React, each with differing optimal use cases, we now have three factions that do not collaborate nearly as much as they should: The differences between these groups are not technical. WebC and Svelte both use single file HTML components and compile to HTML, CSS, and JS, usually mediated through a chosen site generator – “meta-framework” if you will – Eleventy and SvelteKit respectively, and they both include custom elements as compile targets. Any debate that presupposes a fundamental technical difference, beyond just their relative sizes, between these two frameworks is already in the wilderness. Using Lit is not morally superior to using Vue. Different frameworks have different trade-offs and, yeah, that does mean that sometimes one is a more productive choice for a situation than the other. Sometimes that means that Lit, Eleventy with WebC, or Enhance, are the better choices. Sometimes it’s Vue, SolidJS, or Svelte. The core difference between the second and third groups is that the third group, like SolidJS for example, often tried at some point to integrate various parts of the Web Components stack into the implementation of their projects and became very frustrated with the technology and now many of them seem to be quite bitter about web components as a result. They were promised platform fundamentals that – because they were the future of frameworks – would work as building blocks of their own projects. This is a needless divide. “Use the platform” developers, web component frameworks, and modern reactive frameworks can all use and benefit from web components today. You can use a web component in Svelte and you can use Svelte to make a web component. WebC will work well using a Svelte component that has been compiled to a custom element. Those who eschew frameworks can use components made in either in their projects. Web Components, if the goal was to improve interoperability and reuse, are a smashing success. They are an incredibly useful building block for modern websites that’s only going to become more useful now that we have broader support for form-participating custom elements. Lea Verou does a good job of explaining what Web Components are good for in her own post on this topic: Frameworks already use native HTML elements in their components. Web components extend what native elements can do, and thus make crafting project-specific components easier across all frameworks (as well as no frameworks). I tried to find a better way to phrase this, but Lea already came up with the perfect framing. Most devs could just stop here, read Lea’s post, nod a few times as they scroll, and be done with it. (Though, you’re most of the way through this behemoth of an essay by now, so you might as well read i to the end.) This is how Web Components work. This is how we should be using web components and frameworks. (And, by the way, the fact that the Font Awesome people have hired her and Zach Leatherman have turned my scepticism about Web Awesome into outright enthusiasm, even if Zach isn’t involved in it directly. I’m very much looking forward to seeing what they and Font Awesome do in the future.) However, the underlying technical reasons why web components are a bad fit for some software architectures are still there, largely unexplored. I’ve had to use web components quite a bit, myself. I largely like them. I even see the appeal of the Shadow DOM, despite its many issues. I’ve used web components (no framework), Lit (a framework designed with web components in mind), and Svelte (a reactive component framework) for complex projects, and I’ve experimented with a lot of the rest with prototypes. But, in my experience, using web components, with or without Lit, to implement a big project end-to-end was usually harder and more complicated than using a reactive framework for the same purposes. It was also sometimes harder than using no framework at all. When people say “use the platform” they aren’t just talking about the handful of Web Component APIs. The platform has more to offer than Custom Elements and Shadow DOMs. Web components can be suboptimal for many projects for reasons that are very similar to the reasons why they aren’t useful for the internal implementation of frameworks like Solid or Svelte, but I can’t speak for framework implementers, only for myself. The first issue has to do with how web components interact with the rest of the Document Object Model (DOM). Every API that’s commonly bundled under the “Web Components” umbrella is defined in terms of their alterations to the DOM: Shadow DOM, custom elements, even the <template> element to some degree. Using them requires injecting them into the DOM tree at specific points. That quickly becomes problematic because the semantics of the DOM are highly dependent on specific hierarchies. The list could go on forever because this is a fundamental part of how both HTML and SVG are designed, so it’s happening throughout both. The DOM fundamentally uses hierarchy for composition. The same element will have different functionality and meaning depending on what parents it has. To use object-oriented terms, the DOM relies heavily on both composition (“X is extended by having a Y”) and inheritance (“X is extended by being a Y and inheriting its features”) in a complex system that does not easily allow for intermediaries. A list only works if the parent ordered or unordered list element is in a direct “has a” relationship with child list elements. Direct parent-child element relationships is one of the building blocks of DOM composition. Components, as an architectural concept, need to add behaviour to and render into these kinds of hierarchies without breaking their structure. Components in many reactive frameworks solve this by not injecting themselves into the DOM at all. They return elements that the rendering context will integrate into the DOM, but they generally won’t be a part of the explicit DOM hierarchy themselves. You don’t want a ListComponent to wrap the li elements it returns in <list-component> tags because that would break the semantics of the DOM. The list would no longer function as a proper list. Components in these frameworks generally exist as an abstraction outside the DOM. A rendering context takes that abstraction (often a “virtual” DOM) and render to the “actual” DOM. That many developers misuse frameworks doesn’t change the fact that modern frameworks are specifically structured around the ability to deliver semantic and accessible DOMs without breaking the parent-child composition that’s integral to modern HTML. This is React’s positive legacy to the world of web development: a way of making components that don’t interfere with the Document Object Model’s core methods for composition and extension. That positive legacy has been carried forward and improved by modern web frameworks. Once you lose the mythical “unidirectional data flow” baggage, and aren’t trying to build the universal UI engine, “return a data structure that gets diffed and merged with a corresponding part of the DOM” is actually a neat and productive idea that fits extremely well with traditional approaches to working with the DOM, such as template rendering. If you look towards approaches to state management that are more akin to the matching up of models with views through some coordination, functional reactive components actually begin to look kind of awesome. They aren’t quite the magic solution React promised, but they are a meaningful and substantial improvement. That’s where we’re at with modern frameworks. That’s what many of the Web Components frameworks are trying for as well, even though they are held back by how custom elements inevitably inject themselves into the DOM, because custom elements are defined in terms of, well, custom DOM elements. That “injection” can make the DOM dysfunctional by interfering with the hierarchy many elements require. It took years for them to finally fix some of the issues Shadow DOM has with forms, and we still occasionally have issues with it interfering with aria- property references, which are used to properly expose the UI to accessibility tools, and labelling across components. How selection APIs interact with Shadow DOMs are still a mess (though hopefully not for long). Custom elements can’t easily be used to render list or table child elements directly. They don’t work at all for extending SVG, which is the only vector drawing surface available to the broader web. Even if you pretend Safari doesn’t exist and just look at Firefox’s progress, their support for form-associated elements was released in 2021, five years after the “v1” release of web components. It’s been a long road. These standards seem legitimately hard to implement, which is what you’d expect once you realise they’re messing with some of the core structures of the web platform. This issue with hierarchical interjection is why you occasionally hear framework types say that web components should mostly be used as “leaf nodes”. If the web component has no children visible to the framework – is a “leaf” not a branch – then it can’t break the hierarchy. It’s a useful rule of thumb if you’re working in the framework world and fits well with how Lea Verou defined the relationship between web components and frameworks in the post I quoted above. The CSS property display: contents; also goes some way to alleviate this issue as it can be used to effectively “disappear” the custom element from the rendering tree, so it doesn’t interfere with, for example, the parent-child relationship between a <ul> and <li> element. This doesn’t address the SVG gap, but if that ends up being the only big issue remaining, then Web Components are in much better shape than many expected they’d ever be in. But, we’re still missing the ability to create custom elements that extend built-in elements. That would be the last remaining issue to solve and would let you deliver web components that render elements like <li> or <td> without interfering with the hierarchy. It is the key to perfecting web components and bringing about the future we were promised. Or is it? There’s reason to believe that the Safari team might be have been right to refuse to implement the is attribute and not let custom elements extend built-ins. When you work with markup, hierarchy can serve as a very powerful form of composition. But, as I outlined earlier, that hasn’t worked too well for custom elements until fairly recently. In practice, their inclusion in the DOM hierarchy often interferes with the composition of built-in elements with little benefit to the custom element itself. Beyond that, there’s a tension inherent in how custom elements were designed. They are simultaneously late- and early bound. They are dynamically late-bound to an element name, <my-custom-element> for example, that then automatically works in the markup and DOM. A script can define a custom element with any valid name it wants. A component or function that renders HTML doesn’t need to import that script directly or have any knowledge of the custom element. The developer can change the composition of a DOM tree simply by mapping a different custom element implementation to that name. The communication between the custom element and its surrounding context is done through messages – events – attributes, and object properties. None of the elements in the surrounding context need to even be aware that the implementation of the custom element has been switched to a different one. This is a form of late binding, or loose coupling, and late-binding is extremely useful for building applications with user interfaces because it lends itself to building complex functionality through composition without, well, binding you to a rigid structure that can be hard to alter as the design realities of the interface are surfaced. You can still easily modify the project as the app gets tested and user feedback pours in. As Alan Kay explained: Late binding allows ideas learned late in project development to be reformulated into the project with exponentially less effort than traditional early binding system. This is a good thing. At the same time, the implementation of custom elements is based on highly specific inheritance that can’t be easily remapped. If you’re rendering in a browser, the HTMLElement class is always going to be HTMLElement. Even though you can technically replace it – JavaScript is a late-bound language as designed – doing so risks breaking the DOM entirely. That means that the implementation and state management of a web component is tightly coupled to its ancestor classes and that will generally make reformulations and alterations harder. Moreover, the DOM’s existing class inheritance tree was not made with web developer subclassing in mind. Its inheritance is complicated and a mess. A few elements actually share interfaces, such as the <q> and <blockquote> elements sharing the HTMLQuoteElement interface and a whole mess of legacy elements sharing the HTMLUnknownElement interface. This complicates matters. Extending built-in elements also has an extremely controversial history and frameworks messing around with built-in language objects, such as Array, have directly hindered platform development and standardisation multiple times in the past. But subclassing those should be fine, right? The subclasses should break anything, right? Well, this is where Liskov’s Gun goes “blam!” because the answer to that is “probably not”. Let’s look at the Liskov substitution principle itself, the one cited by that WebKit developer all those years ago: Subtype Requirement: Let ⁠ ϕ ( x ) ⁠ be a property provable about objects ⁠ x ⁠ of type T. Then ⁠ ϕ ( y ) ⁠ should be true for objects ⁠ y ⁠ of type S where S is a subtype of T. Well that clears that right up! So clear. So obvious. That doesn’t sound like gobbledygook to regular humans at all! Effectively, paraphrasing the above-linked Wikipedia page into human(ish) terms, what it means is that if S is a subclass of T objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering the correctness of the program. That is, if you subclass HTMLInputElement, instances of your subclass need to work correctly whenever they’re substituted for an instance of the original HTMLInputElement and, because JavaScript as a language isn’t really able to offer any such guarantee, this principle can’t easily be enforced in the browser runtime. So, you’re left with debating the principle itself, which is an argument that can definitely be made on an abstract level, but once you narrow it down to DOM elements specifically, I think the overall principle becomes quite compelling. Remember the section above about how the DOM uses hierarchy (“has a” relationships) for composition? How elements such as <table>, <li>, and <input> to name a few, need specific parent-child relationships to function properly? Well, the built-in subclasses that provide the interfaces these elements use are an important part of making that composition work. One of the more important uses cases for web components is to let people implement and distribute reusable widget that are interoperable across multiple projects, frameworks, or even organisations. Much of the standardisation work surrounding web components has been towards ensuring that these packaged widgets don’t interfere with the outside DOM and that they won’t be interfered with by it in return. That’s what the Shadow DOM is for. Because of this, you can take a <custom-date-picker> widget and include it in your project without much worry, provided you aren’t using it to wrap elements that require a direct parent-child relationship with specific other elements to work. Now that we have broad support for form-associated elements, this mostly works and provides a good foundation for interesting projects such as a new generation of open source widget libraries. But if you take an <input is="custom-date-picker"> element, you don’t have the same assurances. You don’t know whether you can actually use it in all the same ways you can use a regular input element. JavaScript can’t offer you that guarantee. Remember that every built-in custom element begins life as their original parent class before they get upgraded by the custom element script, so it could start off being compatible but then suddenly become incompatible when a script loads. Seen from this perspective, broad adoption of custom elements that extend built-in elements does seem likely to cause serious and hard-to-solve bugs in a non-trivial proportion of the projects who would use them. Or, in the words of Ryosuke Niwa, the WebKit dev who originally cited the Liskov substitution principle, writing on the topic eight years ago: One fundamental problem is that subclassing a subclass of HTMLInputElement or HTMLImageElement often leads to a violation of the Liskov substitution principle over time. Because they’re builtin elements, they’re very likely to be extended in the future. Imagine that we had this feature supported before type=date was added. Then your subclass of HTMLInputElement must also support type=date in order to satisfy the substitution principle. Similarly, imagine we had added this feature before srcset was added to HTMLImageElement and you wrote a subclass of HTMLImageElement. Then not supporting srcset results in the violation of the principle again. In addition, none of the builtin elements are designed to be subclassed, and in fact, we don’t have builtin subclasses of HTMLElement that are also builtins. This limits the usefulness of any sort of subclassing. Furthermore, we don’t have any hooks for the processing models and internal states of builtin elements such as the dirtiness of HTMLImageElement’s value and when and how HTMLInputElement picks the appropriate image. I mean, yeah. When it’s put this way, it does sound problematic. Overall, class inheritance versus composition is a classic question of trade-offs in software development and in software with graphical user interfaces – especially web-based ones – I’d argue that inheritance is the wrong trade-off for this task in particular because it’s interfering with an already complex inheritance system, which in turn can complicate even further how custom elements interact with the hierarchical composition of markup. Reactive components, as implemented by most modern frameworks, make a different trade-off. They tend to be functional, even if they aren’t implemented as functions. They still inherit React’s issue of only working when rendered to a DOM with all the side effects that entails, but because most of them are thinner abstractions than React and target fewer platforms, I’d argue that the issue has become more manageable. You render to a DOM element and test that element as a data structure. With React you often don’t even know if the final target is a DOM element, HTML string, Android view, or UIKit view. Instead of the subclasses you have to deal with in Web Components, you often have a series of function invocations that treat the returned DOM representation as, ideally, side-effect-free data they can modify and pass on. Immutable data structures are popular in among this crowd for good reasons. The representation that’s returned usually isn’t an actual DOM fragment, but gets resolved and rendered into the “real” DOM by a rendering context. To quote Mayank I can create an <Input> primitive component that wraps an <input> element. And I can create a <ThemedInput> component that wraps the primitive <Input>. Then someone else can take my <ThemedInput> and create a <PasswordInput> on top of it. After all of these components are resolved and initialized, the final DOM tree should really only contain a single <input> element. The intermediate components are not (always) relevant for the DOM tree. The browser doesn’t care how the code on my website is organized. In other words, components are totally made up. That doesn’t mean components are not useful; just that they exist in a different plane. This is what makes it possible to compose all the way up to a <Page> component Trying to accomplish this with web components is tricky and the end result is usually a deeply nested tree of custom elements. You can hide some of that in Shadow DOMs but that introduces a new set of problems caused by the Shadow DOM itself. Using web components as native-like components that are entirely external to the rendering process bypasses this in part, but if you are authoring the “leaf” web components yourself, I’d argue that the emphasis on inheritance and de-emphasis of composition will make the creation of complex widgets harder and more error-prone than it would be with a framework’s component system. The interoperability benefits and the fact you’re building with web standards, which generally do not change once they’ve been shipped across multiple browsers, gives you stability and should lower development costs in the long run. For many, if not most, organisations this trade-off should be worthwhile. But there’s a good chance that using web components to implement the core architecture of your app could make the task harder. You’re likely to have to lean heavily on inheritance and classes and eschew composition for implementing the logic and flow of the application. It absolutely can be done, either by minimising your use of class inheritance or by being thoughtful about it, but one of the reasons why reactive component frameworks, even though all the modern ones are considerably younger than web components as a technology, are so popular among devs, even the developers that don’t have to use React for organisational or political reasons, is that their architecture makes these tasks a little bit simpler. Interlocking functional components that use signals for state, for example, are easier to use and reason about than interlocking class-based web components that use properties and events for state and reactivity. This does not matter that much if the web component is a “leaf” node, the last stop on the line so to speak, but it begins to matter a lot if these components are being use throughout an app’s overall structure. Thankfully, you don’t have to use a framework to get these features. You can write functional components that use signals for reactive state using either standalone lit-html or uhtml tagged template libraries. You don’t need the full framework baggage. Some frameworks, such as Enhance offer similar capabilities that are functional and reactive out of the box. We have a spectrum of options that range from using only platform APIs, to specialised libraries, to lightweight frameworks, and all the way to fully-fledged “batteries included” web development frameworks. One size very much does not fit all. We should feel free to choose the toolset that’s appropriate for our task and our project. We should not saddle ourselves with unnecessary work out of habit or misplaced loyalties towards one “team” or another. And none of us should be using React. Web components don’t really work for quite a few of the tasks we were initially told they would be good for. Pointing that out isn’t a criticism of the web as a platform. Nor does it imply that you should always use a framework or that you can’t get anything done using just platform APIs with a small selection of libraries. All it means is that this particular slice of the web platform turned out to have limitations we need to be mindful of when we do our work. Given the limitations I went into above, it doesn’t surprise me that many framework implementers found it hard or impossible to use web components to implement a framework for reactive functional components. There’s a clear mismatch there. It also casts some light on what framework maintainers mean when they say that Web Components are a bad direction for web development. If web components, specifically, represent the future of web development, then it’s a future filled with awkward class inheritance hierarchies, even deeper markup hierarchies, and layers of code whose only purpose it is to mitigate how custom elements and the Shadow DOM interfere with regular HTML and SVG composition. It’s a vision of a future where web development is substantially harder, less powerful, and less productive. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s a future anybody wants or is even working towards. Web Components are great for what they are, genuinely great, but they don’t represent the extent or promise of the platform. There’s so much more happening. Recent additions to the web platform are squarely aimed at a much brighter future, one that helps developers implement great experiences without sacrificing usability, performance, or accessibility. That’s just to name a few and does not even begin to go into the many potential future standards that might improve things even further. Web standardisation today is in a much better place than it was a few years ago and instead of pushing the web harder in the direction of web components, most people seem content to sand off their rough edges and make them work better with the rest of the platform, using features such as Declarative Shadow DOM and ElementInternals. We’re letting web components “be their best selves”. Over time, these improvements to the platform might together change how we do web development in meaningful ways: It’s increasingly popular to rail against the existence of web apps. People get angry about how much crap gets loaded into your average website. The web is filled with ads and tracking software that are making it less and less usable. Quite a few sites are also implemented using bloated frameworks that would be barely acceptable if they were being used to implement a revolutionary killer app but are completely beyond the pale for building a regular website or dashboard. The web is a mess that seems to only be getting less usable and messier by the minute. You’d be justified in dismissing the entire concept of web apps: Websites don’t need this. This is all bullshit. But none of the tech I’ve discussed is really to blame for what has happened to the web. That lies squarely with advertising as a business model and React’s unique dysfunctions. Web Components, new web APIs, and newer more modern frameworks of every kind represent our path out of the web crisis and shouldn’t be rejected just because they involve JavaScript. This isn’t just a question of fixing web’s current issues. We need web apps. We both need more web apps, and we need more capable web apps. Mainstream Operating Systems – Android, ChromeOS, Windows, macOS, iOS, and the rest – are increasingly closed platforms whose primary software markets are managed through conservative and puritanical central committees: their hidebound App Stores. The platforms themselves are constantly shifting and changing depending on what fad the OS vendor is chasing to boost its stock price. For example, many iOS app developers sacrifice months of every year updating their apps to keep up with platform changes. If they don’t, they lose customers because their apps are broken or perceived to be broken. These are months they could be using to implement genuine improvements to their apps and to build their businesses. Those businesses can only use the specific business models approved by a platform’s central committee, are only allowed to include the content deemed morally appropriate by that central committee, and need to have every update and minute elements of its marketing strategy approved by faceless serfs working in a soul-draining bureaucracy. More importantly, these institutions also do not stand up to authoritarian powers. They will bow down to the demands of China, and they will not stand in the way of an authoritarian takeover of a democratic country. We need web apps. Web apps are the only open and standardised GUI software development and distribution platform that’s available to us. Discarding them out of spite or annoyance is exactly the sort of situation that the phrase “don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater” was coined for. We need this. And, thankfully, web standards are slowly but surely stepping up. Now we only need to make sure that OS vendors, such as Google or Apple, don’t stand in its way. And we need to make sure we don’t stand in its way.

by Mark Steyn Clubland Q&A October 9, 2024 https://www.steynonline.com/14692/live-around-the-planet-wednesday-october-9th Thank you for all your questions. If you missed the live broadcast, the action replay can be heard in full here. UPPERDATE! We're live now, so let's have at it! UPDATE! We'll be going live in about fifteen minutes, so do get ready to fire off your questions via the comment form below. See you at the top of the hour. And to listen simply click the livestream feed. Yes, it's me! Mark Steyn of that ilk - back in the saddle for another hour of questions from Steyn Clubbers around the planet. Our Clubland Q&A starts live at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm British Summer Time/9pm Central European. If you chance to be elsewhere, do check local listings below. As we go to air, Hurricane Milton - the world's strongest this year - is barreling down on Florida, a mere fortnight after Hurricane Helene. We hope our many Club members in the Sunshine State, and others in the path of this storm, will stay safe. Six million Floridians have been ordered to evacuate. America is four weeks from its laughably misnamed "Election Day", so there are political implications to meteorological phenomena in swing states. I'm happy to discuss those or anything else on your mind, but I am particularly mindful of the callousness of our age. I'm thinking not just of bigfoot media's indifference to the suffering in Appalachia, but of a thousand smaller, daily tragedies. Last Thursday, for example, Dr Jackie Stone became the latest Covid contrarian to be driven to kill herself: On 3 October @DrJackieStone took her own life. Everything she valued and found purpose in was taken from her. If you don't know by now, this is how it works if you speak up against The Narrative. Here is an extract from her final interview. 🎥Me and @woodybaloo... pic.twitter.com/RiTmLXT02I I cannot claim to have known Dr Stone except through the Internet - she followed me on Twitter after we began telling the stories of vaccine victims on The Mark Steyn Show. I knew that she had developed an effective protocol for treating Covid that included Ivermectin - she practised in Zimbabwe, where, strange though it may sound to American and European ears, the government was rather less deranged in the Covid years than that of, say, Minnesota or France. Nevertheless, because Dr Stone's treatment was insufficient of a cash cow for Big Pharma and the public health agencies they have corrupted, she was targeted and, as noted above, lost everything in her life. After hosting a health summit with other dissident doctors at Victoria Falls just over two months ago, she fell into despair and joined the lengthening list of those around the world so comprehensively punished for their dissent that there was nothing left but suicide. You may be over Covid but Covid isn't over you - because it's the template for your future. The evil men who imposed the lockdown/vaccine regime on you will do it all over again next time - even though, as we now know, they went to "drug-fueled sex parties" while a generation of kids was psychologically kiboshed and women's fertility nosedived across the west. The "conventional wisdom" is now literally killing us - and yet, as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry have recently assured us, in the future they're building any objection to it will not be tolerated. On today's Clubland Q&A I'm happy to entertain your thoughts on that, or on anything else you want to raise. Whether or not you're a member of The Mark Steyn Club, you can listen to our show live as it happens wherever you chance to be on this turbulent earth: Club membership is required only to ask a question. We love to hear from brand new members, and especially appreciate those who are having such a great time in these parts that they've signed up a chum for a Steyn Club Gift Membership. Among the additions to our ranks in recent days are newbies from around the globe - from Belfast to Bigfork, from Tokoroa to Thief River Falls, from London, Ontario to Latham in the Australian Capital Territory. Whether you've joined this week either for a full year or a see-how-it-goes experimental quarter, do shoot me a head-scratcher for today's show. But, if you're not interested in joining, no worries, as they say in Oz: We seek no unwilling members - and as always the show is free to listen to, so we hope you'll want to tune in. So see you back here at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm in London, 9pm in Paris, 10pm in Jerusalem; half-past-ten in Teheran; midnight-forty-five in Kathmandu; 3am in Singapore and Honkers (sorry about that); 5am in Sydney and Melbourne; 7am in Auckland, and a rather more convivial hour for the kippers and kedgeree in His Majesty's Dominions eastward across the Pacific, where you're so far ahead I've probably already lost my appeal by now...

Title: Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan

October 09, 2024 09:55 ET | Source: Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”)LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan Alliance Witan PLC (“Alliance Witan” or the “Company”) announces that its investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), has appointed Jennison Associates (“Jennison”) as an additional stock picker for its multi-manager global equity portfolio, taking the total number of stock pickers to eleven. New York and Boston-based Jennison was founded in 1969. It has $210 billion of assets under management (as of 30 June 2024) and specialises in investing in companies with exceptional growth prospects. Jennison previously managed part of the multi-manager global equity portfolio of Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) before the latter’s combination with Alliance Trust plc to create Alliance Witan (the “Combination”), which completed on 9 October. Jennison’s allocation of approximately 5% of the Company’s portfolio has been largely filled from a subset of the stocks which it managed within Witan. Most of the balance of Witan’s portfolio transferred pursuant to the Combination has been handed to BlackRock, which is acting as transition manager, for realignment. However, with two managers in common between Alliance Trust and Witan – Veritas Asset Management and GQG Partners – there have also been some other in specie transfers of stock which will be retained. The overall risk profile of the Alliance Witan portfolio will remain largely unchanged from that of the Alliance Trust portfolio before the Combination, reflecting the continuation of the distinctive multi-manager approach previously employed. There will be no major regional, style or sectoral biases relative to the market, with most of the added value designed to come from stock picking. Details of allocations by manager will be available in the next factsheet. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “Jennison has long been one of our highest-rated managers and will diversify our exposure to growth stocks. The combination with Witan gives us the opportunity to transfer them in largely in-specie, hence with relatively low transaction costs.” 9 October 2024

Title: TCPC stock touches 52-week low at $8.03 amid market challenges

In a turbulent market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, dipping to $8.03. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -26.42% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring TCPC as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its performance and valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the company's short-term outlook and potential strategic adjustments moving forward. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has announced a series of leadership changes. Rajneesh Vig will step down from his roles as Chairman and CEO but will remain on the Board of Directors until January 31, 2025. Phil Tseng will take over as Chairman and CEO, and Jason Mehring will assume the role of President. Patrick Wolfe has been appointed the new COO, and Dan Worrell will join Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. The company also reported notable financial achievements. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, resulting in an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. The Q2 2024 earnings report disclosed an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of about 14%. A third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share was declared, indicating a strong financial position. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a smooth transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent dip to a 52-week low aligns with several key insights from InvestingPro. The stock's volatility and recent price decline are reflected in InvestingPro data, which shows a 22.62% price drop over the last three months. This downward trend is further emphasized by the stock trading at just 66.09% of its 52-week high. Despite these challenges, TCPC maintains a significant dividend yield of 24.16%, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that TCPC has maintained dividend payments for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns even in difficult times. However, the company's financial health presents a mixed picture. While TCPC's revenue grew by 16.64% over the last twelve months, reaching $232.32 million, an InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company was not profitable during this period. This aligns with the negative P/E ratio of -11.32 and the diluted EPS of -$0.71. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 5 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into TCPC's financial situation and future prospects.

TOPSHOT - Union members react as Aerospace Machinists District 751 President Jon Holden (out of ... [+] frame) announces that union members rejected a proposed Boeing contract and will go on strike, following voting results at their union hall in Seattle, Washington, on September 12, 2024. Boeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike on September 12, rejecting a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for staff given the company's stressed financial condition. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks staged broad rallies on Tuesday with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 1% and Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.45% Small cap stops were flat on the day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%. Markets have been swayed a bit by activity in China where some mixed messaging from the government has caused wide swings in prices. After recently announcing aggressive stimulus measures that boosted stock prices, many expected a furthering of those plans this week. However, when Chinese authorities hosted a press conference Tuesday, hopes for yet more stimulus were dashed. A couple weeks ago I made the comment that it felt as if China was throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at their economy. The failure to announce any additional plans on Tuesday brings up concerns that China is running out of options. This is still an evolving story and one worth monitoring as it could have implications for U.S. markets. Back here at home, there are a few stocks I'll be following today. Boeing announced it was breaking off talks with its machinist union. The company withdrew its most recent offer to raise wages by 30% and as of now, there are no plans to restart the negotiations. In the wake of the contract negotiations breakdown, S&P Global Ratings said it may lower its rating on Boeing bonds to junk status which would likely be a significant blow to the company whose stock is already down around 40% for the year. Shares of Google parent company, Alphabet are lower by 0.5% in premarket. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced they may seek to have the company broken up, alleging the current structure creates a monopoly. This is an interesting story not just in terms of what happens to Alphabet, but also, what type of precedent this may set for other companies, some of which comprise the Magnificent Seven. Should the company be broken apart, I would not be surprised if it spurred activity around companies such as Meta or even Apple. The question I would have is whether those companies seek spinoffs before possibly being forcibly broken apart, or if the companies would instead fight the DOJ. I actually believe these types of breakups, although disruptive in the short term, can have potential to benefit shareholders, so it is something to keep an eye on. Constellation Energy has seen its stock surge nearly 80% since early August. While we don't typically think of energy stocks as exciting, the sector is in play because of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The computing power for AI and energy required is creating a lot of interesting activity in the sector. In addition to established players in the field, new entrants are also emerging. Companies such as Oklo Incorporated, whose stock has more than doubled from a low of $5.35 just last month, are drawing attention to a sector not typically considered as high growth. Speaking of AI, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor reported strong earnings overnight. That stock is indicated higher by just under 1% in premarket. The positive news also has shares of Nvidia indicated higher by 1% and trading at a new all-time high. We'll see if a breakout to new highs has the ability to excite the broader market as well. For today, in addition to the stocks mentioned above, I am particularly interested in the release of the most recent Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from last month's reading. As I mentioned on Monday, given the magnitude of the cut to interest rates but continued indication of strength in the economy, I think these minutes will garner more scrutiny than we typically see. I also think the minutes will give some context to tomorrow's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and Friday's Producer Price Index (PPI). Friday will also be the start to earnings season with both JP Morgan and Wells Fargo scheduled to report. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

The S&P 500 is little changed a day after a nearly 1% bounce-back rally. Tuesday's gains for the market were driven, in part, by a pullback in oil prices, which had been climbing on Mideast tensions. Crude was modestly lower Wednesday morning. 2. The Justice Department is considering asking a federal court to break up Google. The DOJ announcement late Tuesday follows an August ruling that deemed the Alphabet-owned search giant a "monopolist." I'm not a fan of DOJ's proposed remedies. They seem overly punitive and designed to hobble the company. We own Alphabet in the Club portfolio. 3. Tesla holds its long-awaited robotaxi event Thursday evening. I think this will be big.

Title: Evercore ISI stock rated Outperform on Amazon amid Kuiper costs
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/evercore-isi-stock-rated-outperform-on-amazon-amid-kuiper-costs-93CH-3655418
Time Published: 2024-10-09T12:15:51Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, Evercore ISI maintained a positive outlook on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $240.00 price target. The firm's analysis highlights the impending launch of satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper, which is set to start in the fourth quarter. Project Kuiper is Amazon's initiative to provide satellite-based Internet service, and it has garnered attention due to its significant investment and potential impact on the company's financials. According to Evercore ISI, Amazon has committed $10 billion to the project and is estimated to spend over $10 billion on 94 planned launches over the next two years. The analyst anticipates Kuiper-related losses to increase substantially in the December quarter, estimating a jump from roughly $250 million in the second quarter to between $600 million and $1 billion. This projection leads to the belief that current Street Operating Income estimates for the fourth quarter may be overly optimistic. Looking ahead to 2025, the firm estimates that losses for Kuiper could soar to between $5 billion and $6 billion before the project starts generating substantial revenue. Despite these significant costs, Evercore ISI suggests that the market opportunity for Kuiper could be undervalued. The firm points to the rapid revenue growth of similar services, like Starlink, and the attractive economics of the satellite Internet segment, which boasts EBITDA margins of 30%-50% among existing competitors. Evercore ISI also notes Amazon's competitive advantages, such as its strong consumer presence and the extensive ground infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The firm posits that even a 1% penetration of Amazon's Global Prime member base could translate to almost $750 million in annual revenue for Kuiper. Additionally, the firm expects Amazon to reveal improvements in core U.S. Retail margins during the Kuiper investment phase, which could mitigate some investor concerns regarding the project's costs. In other recent news, Cantor Fitzgerald has raised its price target for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to $670, maintaining an Overweight rating based on anticipated surpassing of third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter guidance. The firm's optimism stems from strong advertising checks and potential growth from features like Reels, A+, and personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Amazon will proceed, despite Amazon's request for dismissal. The core allegations involve anti-competitive tactics and an algorithm that allegedly inflated prices for U.S. consumers. TD Cowen has maintained its Buy rating on Amazon shares, projecting a 10.7% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue growth, primarily driven by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising revenues. Similarly, Mizuho Securities has reiterated an Outperform rating on Amazon, with a price target of $240.00, citing increased investment estimates in AWS and a revised upward spending forecast. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) Automotive, backed by Amazon, has revised its full-year production forecast downward due to a parts shortage. The company now anticipates producing between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles for the year, a reduction from the previously projected 57,000 units. As Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) embarks on its ambitious Project Kuiper, InvestingPro data provides additional context to the company's financial position. Despite the anticipated losses from the satellite project, Amazon's revenue growth remains robust, with a 12.32% increase over the last twelve months to $604.33 billion. This growth underscores the company's ability to invest in future technologies while maintaining its core business strength. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Amazon is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.19. This suggests that the market may not be fully pricing in the company's growth potential, including the long-term benefits of Project Kuiper. Additionally, Amazon's strong return over the last five years, as noted in another InvestingPro Tip, indicates a track record of successful long-term investments. While the Kuiper project will undoubtedly impact Amazon's financials, the company's operating income margin of 9.0% and EBITDA of $104.05 billion over the last twelve months demonstrate its current profitability. This financial cushion may help Amazon weather the initial investment phase of Project Kuiper. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Amazon, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Talk about an undecided market. As of the close on Monday, October 7, in four of the past five days, the closing range of the S&P 500 (SPX) was 13.6 points. That is two-tenths of 1% based on the price of the index. For the Nasdaq, the range in four out of five days was 14.76 points or eight one-hundredths of 1%. The Nasdaq 100's (QQQ) range was 0.83 points or two-tenths of 1%. The Nasdaq and the QQQ tested their 21-day exponential a few times and remain perilously close to breaking that average, while the SPX has come close to the average on several occasions intraday. Third-quarter EPS season is now underway and the next three weeks will be very heavy with earnings reports. Just prior to and just after earnings reports, companies are in a blackout period. During that time, a company cannot repurchase its stock. So in April/early May, July/early August, October/early November, and January/early February, there is an absence of demand that can create weakness in the overall market. First-quarter 2024 share buybacks on the S&P 500 were $237 billion and for the 12-months ending March 2024, buybacks were $817 billion.

Title: Bitcoin Price Surge In 2024 Not Enough To Beat Gold’s Risk-Adjusted Returns – Details Here
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-surge-in-2024-not-enough-to-beat-golds-risk-adjusted-returns-details-here/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T11:00:44Z
Full Content:
According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin (BTC) price appreciation in 2024 failed to compensate for its price volatility risks. Meanwhile, gold’s higher risk-adjusted returns reaffirmed its “safe haven” narrative. The leading digital asset by reported market cap surged from roughly $42,000 at the beginning of the year to as high as $73,000 in March 2024, recording more than 73% gains. At its current market price of $62,790, BTC is still more than 40% up from its price in January 2024. Notably, throughout 2024, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed major equity indices, fixed-income instruments, gold, and crude oil. However, according to data tracked by Goldman Sachs, despite BTC’s impressive gains, its price performance in absolute terms fails to compensate for its volatility. The analysis by Goldman Sachs puts BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) volatility ratio at just under 2%. In comparison, gold gave a risk-adjusted return of 3%, posting strong 28% gains in absolute terms. For the uninitiated, the volatility ratio measures the return an asset generates for each unit of risk or volatility it carries. A higher ratio indicates that an asset provides better returns relative to the risk taken, while a lower ratio suggests less efficient performance. The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s volatility ratio was only better than Ethereum’s native ETH token, S&P GSCI Energy Index, and Japan’s TOPIX index among the non-fixed income growth-sensitive investments. Bitcoin’s low volatility ratio compared to gold cements the latter’s claim as a “safe haven asset.” This came under the limelight last week when BTC slumped, and gold surged following Iran’s offensive against Israel. Since its inception following the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin’s ascent to a trillion-dollar market cap asset has been remarkable. The fixed supply of 21 million, decentralized network architecture, and halving every four years make BTC an appealing asset. However, the market cap gap between Bitcoin and gold remains vast. That said, several crypto analysts are confident that Bitcoin will outperform the shining metal in the coming years. For instance, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt recently made an ambitious prediction that by 2025, BTC could see its price jump 400% relative to gold. Similarly, in August 2024, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck stated that BTC could surge to $350,000 on the back of greater adoption. Most recently, investment management firm BlackRock declared Bitcoin a “gold alternative” due to its fixed supply and increasing investor confidence in its ability to tackle inflation and avoid value erosion during uncertain times. On the contrary, billionaire Ray Dalio has expressed his opinion on the Bitcoin vs. gold narrative, saying that BTC will never fully replace gold. BTC trades at $62,790 at press time, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

Title: YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on BABO (69.59%), MRNY (61.51%), FBY (58.57%), YMAX (60.44%), YMAG (76.46%) and Others

October 09, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for PLTY is October 7, 2024. 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX and YMAG) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 8, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH and GDXY. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTY), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: MGE Energy, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MGEE) institutional investors lost 3.2% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains

Significantly high institutional ownership implies MGE Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.2b last week. Still, the 27% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGE Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for MGE Energy Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. MGE Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGE Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. MGE Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 16% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of MGE Energy, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$6.1m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGE Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with MGE Energy , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Title: China markets plunge on Beijing stimulus disappointment

Full Content:
Shares in mainland China plunged as traders expressed their disappointment with the lack of new stimulus. The U.S. government’s possible attempt to break up Google weighed on tech. China: Hong Kong and Shanghai plunges over stimulus sadness A day after Hong Kong’s Hang Sang Index posted its steepest one-day plunge since 2008, China mainland shares took their own steep dive. Shanghai’s SSE Composite dropped 6.62% while Hong Kong gave up another 1.38% as investors again voted against Beijing’s Tuesday explanation of its stimulus plans—which offered few details and no new big measures. China’s finance minister will give another briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei rises as 7-Eleven owner shares rise on higher bid The Nikkei 225 rose 0.87%, buoyed by shares in retailer Seven & i Holdings, which soared as much as 11.7% before closing up 4.71% after Bloomberg reported that Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard had increased its takeover bid by about 20%. Tech shares also rose, as new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament in advance of Oct. 27 snap elections in which he hopes to consolidate power. Europe: Shares waver as fading China optimism and Rio Tinto deal dampen upswing European stocks rose slightly early Wednesday, as fading China optimism softened a general upswing. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.50% in early trading with broad-based rises, tempered by a drop in Rio Tinto shares on the announcement it was buying Arcadium Lithium for $6.7 billion. The STOXX Europe 600 was up a marginal 0.18%. U.S. premarket slips with Boeing and Google news A day after all three rose, the main U.S. indexes were all down in premarket trading Wednesday, as Boeing’s withdrawal of its pay offer to its striking machinists trimmed 0.8% from its shares, and the announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet. The possible DOJ action weighed on tech more broadly, a day after the group of tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven all rose, with the largest gain going to Nvidia, up 4.1% Tuesday. And earnings season is here: Delta Air Lines reports on Thursday, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. CPI data for September will also be released before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-wegovy-zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-cost-effects-1851660134
Time Published: 2024-10-09T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
A highly effective class of weight loss drug has taken the world by storm, as medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound become household names. These drugs, originally meant to treat diabetes, have become widely known for their slimming side effects. Surging demand for these drugs has transformed pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for highly-coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. This guide will break down everything you need to know about these drugs, their differences, how they work, and their potential side effects. Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound are all considered incretin medications, drugs that influence a group of hormones that impact insulin production in the body. These treatments work by spiking certain gut hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. Incretin drugs were originally only meant to be used for treating diabetes, but because they have also been found to reduce a user’s appetite, they have now been officially approved for weight loss and other health benefits. Ozempic is a blockbuster diabetes drug produced by the Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. It is part of a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). This class of drugs was first developed in the 1990s when scientists identified a hormone-like molecule in the venom of a Gila monster, a lizard native to the American Southwest, that stimulated insulin secretion. Fast-forward a decade later, and companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) started selling synthetic versions of this molecule to treat diabetes. In December of 2017, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide (brand name Ozempic) for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Ozempic is one of the most advanced versions of these drugs currently on the market, as previous versions required at least once-daily injections. Ozempic is administered just once a week. Because the drug regulates blood sugar levels, reduces appetite, and slows down stomach emptying, one of its side effects is weight loss. After Ozempic’s slimming side effects became widely known, doctors started prescribing it off-label to treat a condition outside the drug’s official approval: weight loss. Novo Nordisk also tested semaglutide, the active ingredient behind Ozempic, in higher doses as a weight loss drug. In 2021, the FDA approved these higher doses of semaglutide, under the brand name Wegovy, for weight loss. As a result, in the United States and some other countries, semaglutide is prescribed and sold as Ozempic when prescribed for diabetes and as Wegovy for weight loss. Novo Nordisk is one of two pharma companies that are currently selling branded GLP-1 treatments. U.S.-based Eli Lilly is the other one. Eli Lilly’s most advanced GLP-1 drugs are Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. The active ingredient behind both these drugs is tirzepatide. The main difference between semaglutide and tirzepatide is that the latter mimics two gut hormones — not just one — GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are chemicals that are known as incretin hormones. These hormones are secreted by the intestines after a person eats to regulate blood sugar levels. Drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide increase the presence of GLP-1 and/or GIP in the human body to unnaturally high levels. Scientists aren’t sure how or why but at these spiked-up levels the hormones reduce a person’s appetite. In short, the primary reason GLP-1 drugs lead to weight loss is that people taking them eat less than they normally do. Different GLP-1 treatments have been found to work at varying speeds, according to clinical trials. The highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% of weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks. To summarize, GLP-1 drug users can expect to lose an average of 15% to 20% of their weight over the course of a year and four months. GLP-1 treatments are typically administered as weekly injections. Wegovy and Zepbound are both taken once-weekly via a subcutaneous injection, or under the skin. A month’s supply of both drugs comes with four single-dose, auto-injector pens — similar to EpiPens. Off-brand versions of these treatments are often sold in single or multi-dose vials. Additionally, Novo Nordisk sells a pill form of semaglutide, under the brand name Rybelsus, for treating type 2 diabetes. The retail price, without insurance, of Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. However, it’s important to note that these list prices don’t reflect what most customers pay after insurance and available manufacturer rebates are applied. Additionally, Eli Lilly started offering single-dose vials — instead of auto-injector pens — of its two lowest doses of Zepbound for $399 and $549 a month, respectively. This option must be paid out-of-pocket. A growing number of companies are now offering generic versions of these treatments, often priced hundreds of dollars lower than their branded counterparts. Insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have refused to cover the medication due to their high cost. A Morgan Stanley survey conducted earlier this year among GLP-1 drug users — including those using the treatments for diabetes — found that about two-thirds of respondents had their medication fully covered by insurance. Those paying out-of-pocket reported an average monthly cost of $196. Novo Nordisk claims that the majority of patients with insurance coverage pay $25 or less for a month’s supply of Ozempic or Wegovy. Additionally, Medicare started covering Wegovy this year for patients who are prescribed the medication as a way to reduce their risk of serious heart events such as heart attacks and strokes. Wegovy and Zepbound have the same side effects. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly caution that their weight loss drugs may cause serious side effects, including the potential risk of thyroid tumors. They advise that patients with a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a type of thyroid cancer, or those with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), should not use these medications. Other serious side effects include: However, the most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, headache, and fatigue. Ozempic face is a non-medical term coined by cosmetic and celebrity dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank, who observed the phenomenon among patients using weight-loss drugs. As these medications gained popularity, more patients began expressing concerns about changes in their facial appearance. Sudden weight loss can rapidly reduce facial fat, leading to changes such as skin shrinkage, sagging, and decreased elasticity. As the skin loses elastin and collagen, it becomes harder for it to retract after significant fat loss, resulting in pronounced signs of aging, loose or sagging skin, and a hollowed appearance. Probes from several health regulators, including the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the European Medicines Agency, have all failed to find evidence that link GLP-1 drugs to suicide, suicidal thoughts, or actions. These investigations followed reports of individuals taking semaglutide and similar drugs exhibiting such behavior. While the FDA couldn’t rule out a “small risk,” it noted that a study funded by the NIH found patients on semaglutide had a lower risk of suicidal thoughts compared to those on other diabetes and anti-obesity medications. Georgios Schoretsanitis, lead author of a separate study, acknowledged no clear evidence of a causal relationship between semaglutide and suicidal ideation, but noted a potential association. His research, based on WHO data, found a 45% higher risk of reported suicidal thoughts in patients taking semaglutide. He cautioned that the results show an association, not proof of causation, and highlighted an increased risk in patients also on antidepressants. He advises clinicians to assess patients’ mental health before starting treatment. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been testing their medications for uses outside of weight loss and diabetes. For example, earlier this year the FDA approved the use of Wegovy for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events for people who are overweight or obese. The change came just months after Novo Nordisk announced results from a clinical trial that found the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20%. For its part, Eli Lilly announced this year that tirzepatide was found to help alleviate sleep apnea in patients with obesity in late-stage clinical trials. Both companies are also testing their medications for the treatment of heart failure. Some studies have also found links between GLP-1s and a reduced risk of cancer, and alcohol and substance abuse. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been struggling to produce enough GLP-1 drugs to meet rising demand. The FDA first declared a shortage of Wegovy in March of 2022. And the pharma company has been limiting starter doses of Wegovy since 2023 to ensure there’s enough supply for patients already on the drug. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said this March that the gap between demand for weight loss drugs and the supply is significant enough to take years to close. Mounjaro was first added to the FDA’s drug shortage list in 2022, while Zepbound was officially declared in limited supply this April. All four drugs — Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound — still remain on the health regulator’s drug shortage, despite all but one dose of Wegovy being listed as currently available on the site. The FDA says that even when all doses of a drug are found to be available, there are other requirements that need to be fulfilled for a drug to be removed from the list, including whether backorders are being fulfilled. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are investing billions of dollars to ramp up production of these drugs. Novo Nordisk announced in February that it has acquired three facilities from the company’s largest shareholder, Novo Holdings, for $11 billion in an effort to address a shortage of Wegovy. The deal was made in connection with Novo Holdings’ acquisition of the drug manufacturing company Catalent (CTLT). Novo Nordisk said in a statement that the acquisition will increase the company’s production capacity beginning in 2026. Eli Lilly said in May that it will pile $5.3 billion into manufacturing its popular weight loss drugs, more than doubling its investment in a manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Indiana. The new spend brings the company’s total investment in the site to a whopping $9 billion, up from its original $3.7 billion commitment — making it now the largest manufacturing investment in the company’s history. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name drugs like Wegovy has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. Companies like Hims & Hers, Sesame, and Noom all started selling compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs for hundreds of dollars cheaper than branded versions. However, there are risks. The compounded formulations are not FDA-approved, so the agency does not review the safety and efficacy of these products. Additionally, the FDA said in July that it had received reports of overdoses related to weight loss drugs, often due to confusion over proper dosing. Dozens of celebrities have come out and shared their experience with weight loss drugs. Late last year, Oprah Winfrey said she used prescription weight loss medications as a “maintenance tool.” Soon after the revelation, she left her seat from the board of WeightWatchers (WW). She had been a member of the board since 2015. In 2022, Elon Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, that he had used Wegovy. Since then, Musk has become a big proponent of GLP-1 medications. Other celebrities who have said they used these drugs are: Kelly Clarkson, Amy Schumer, Whoopi Goldberg, Tracy Morgan, and Chelsea Handler. Several pharmaceutical companies are racing to introduce their own weight loss drugs to the market and disrupt the current duopoly held by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. These companies include Viking Therapeutics, which is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill. Larger pharma companies like Roche, Amgen (AMGN), and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs. To combat the growing competition, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are testing their drugs — as noted above — for other health benefits. They’re also testing newer and more powerful meds. Eli Lilly has nine obesity and diabetes drugs in development which could add even more health benefits to its portfolio of medications. These experimental treatments include a weight loss pill, orforglipron. The pill is currently in a phase 3 trial — its results will readout next year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. Eli Lilly is also testing a strong GLP-1 injection, retatrutide, which in a clinical trial helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks. Novo Nordisk is testing a weight loss pill of its own, amycretin. Novo Nordisk said that in a trial, patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. The Danish pharma company is also developing a more potent obesity treatment called CagriSema. This new drug combines semaglutide with amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. Results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected this year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) was announced by a prominent crypto personality as the most donated meme coin as these type of coins continue to grow in importance for charitable causes. This kind of recognition shows how these digital assets can benefit communities and gain business traction. Meme coin projects have earned praise from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for donating a percentage of their token supply to charity. He thanked the projects and efforts dedicated to this cause in a post on X. Some “meme coins” were used as examples, including “ebull,” among well-known cryptocurrencies contributing to various charities. I appreciate all the memecoins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity. (eg. I saw ebull sent a bunch to various groups last month) Anything that gets sent to me gets donated to charity too (thanks moodeng! The 10B from today is going to anti-airborne-disease… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 7, 2024 Based on comments made by Buterin, Shiba Inu community members have claimed that among meme coins, SHIB leads in charity gifts. According to crypto expert Del Crxpto, no other meme coin can even emulate Shiba Inu’s level of philanthropy. For example, several donations, including to the recent Seungil Hope Foundation in Seoul, Korea which supports the country’s first specialized ALS hospital, reflect this growing dedication to giving. $SHIB is #1 in this regard… No one else comes close. https://t.co/PgnMvn8PYx — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) October 7, 2024 In related news, with good breakout and backtest signs in the very vibrant meme coin space, technical analyst Charting Guy has predicted a possible price spike for Shiba Inu.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years

We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows. Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the top technology companies, having made a name for itself in developing and supplying semiconductor devices. While Nvidia is a leader in artificial intelligence graphics, Broadcom is making a mark on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) The company is gaining traction in a growing market and currently produces the top ASICs used by businesses needing general-purpose AI chips, such as large tech companies like Meta and Alphabet. J.P. Morgan projects the addressable market for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s custom AI chips could reach $150 billion over the next four to five years, thanks to the company’s pioneering efforts in this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s business growth. More precisely, Broadcom stated in June that it was expected to sell over $11 billion worth of AI chips this year. The company’s AI-focused chip sales more than tripled to $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Not only is that incredible year-over-year growth, but Broadcom’s AI sales accounted for an impressive 24% of the company’s sales in the quarter, total revenue totalling $13.1 billion. During the earnings call, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO Hock Tan stated that “customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters” and that the demand for custom AI accelerators is still growing. As chip customers keep returning for more, the company should generate more revenue and earnings to return to shareholders. Here is what Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also performed well during the quarter, as the company reported better-than-expected earnings, with an upside from demand related to AI. This long-term holding is strongly positioned to benefit from continued AI demand, with AI sales in the quarter up 400% over the prior year. Overall, AI-related revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue in 2024 and is on pace to represent a majority of the company’s revenue within two to three years.” Overall AVGO ranks 4th on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Pixabay/Public Domain Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Corporate Transparency Act â The most aggressive domestic spying program since the Patriot Act

(Article by Peter McIlvenna republished from TheGatewayPundit.com) These words reflected the general and growing distrust of the government. Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison.

Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question.

Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny.

It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs.

Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause?

Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place.

Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Pay no attention to the global investment corporations that are vying for access to the natural resources—like lithium—in North Carolina’s landscape, and the shadowy business with no substantial presence in the marketplace, whose agents are running the property valuation operations! Confused? Allow me to explain. On the FEMA website, one can navigate to a webpage that discloses the recipients of certain federal FEMA contracts, and what services those contractors provide; here’s an explanation of the relationship between FEMA and the private sector: FEMA Advance Contracts for goods and services are competed [sic] and awarded in advance of major disaster declarations to provide efficient, cost-effective means for rapid delivery of supplies and services for recurring disaster response and recovery requirements. If you search for the private companies with contracts for the “Housing Inspection Services” function, you’ll see two contracts, one to “WSP USA Services, Inc.” and the other to Vanguard Inspection Services. Screenshot from FEMA webpage For context, WSP is a environmental consulting firm based out of Canada, with BlackRock and Vanguard Group being major investors. Here’s a breakdown, from The Wall Street Journal “Markets” page: Screenshot from WSJ Markets Regarding Vanguard Inspection Services, it’s got all the markers of a front company; as far as I can tell, it looks as though VIS exists solely to do business with FEMA. From the homepage of the company website: Vanguard Inspection Services is fully committed to providing complete and compliant Disaster Home Inspections under FEMA’s Housing Inspection Services (HIS) Program. VIS’s committed staff, in partnership with our cadre of Independent Contractors performing disaster housing inspections, provide a quality service to ensure disaster survivors receive the assistance they need in an expedient manner. A number of the site’s other pages appear incomplete, with many displaying random code throughout—with who knows how many millions being funneled into VIS, you’d think they’d produce a legitimate looking website, but it just looks like a hack job. (Vanguard Group is not to be confused with Vanguard Inspection Services.) Now, a Florida county government recently announced that FEMA would be conducting “free” home inspections, which is part of the process to rebuild: After Floridians apply for FEMA assistance following Hurricane Helene, a home inspection may be necessary to help determine whether the home is safe, sanitary, and livable. Per the same announcement, inspectors will consider things like livability, whether or not the utility connections and systems are in “working order,” the “structural soundness” of the domicile, and whether or not the property is “safe” to access. First of all, we need to consider the implications of home inspectors, employed in part by BlackRock and Vanguard investments, surveying the damage and assessing the value of hurricane-stricken North Carolina—especially because of the vast lithium deposits in the ground beneath and around these private properties. According to Straits Research, a major market analyst, the demand for lithium is going to explode over the next few years: The global lithium market size was valued at USD 38.2 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of USD 230.4 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 22.1% during the forecast period (2023-2031). This is a more than 500% increase in less than a decade. Here’s this, from a report less than two weeks ago; Albemarle, a major lithium producer, is pursuing lithium production in North Carolina. Earlier this year, it announced plans to reopen the resource-rich lithium Kings Mountain mine in the state by the end of 2026, supported by $150 million in DoE funding. However, it has faced backlash from environmentalists and indigenous groups looking to block the development, which has led to delays. Albemarle is looking to expand its domestic lithium production. And, wouldn’t you know it, but BlackRock is major investor in Albemarle: On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc. (Trades, Portfolio), a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock's total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle…. Are company agents essentially working on behalf of BlackRock and Vanguard going to be impartial parties as they value and assess the properties destroyed by Hurricane Helene? Are they going to deem these residences “liveable” and “safe” if their bosses want what’s buried beneath the homes? Is there an incentive for these contracted “home inspectors” to screw the homeowners out of their own property? Will these homes be condemned, so the BlackRock and Vanguard bosses can dole out paltry “fair market value” pennies, and become even wealthier? If I didn’t know any better, I’d reckon this is fixing to be one of the great wealth transfers in the history of the U.S. Image: Public domain.

With new developments and predictions, Cardano (ADA) continues to attract attention in the crypto world, presenting investors with a divided picture. Analyst Dan Gambardello recently expressed a bullish prognosis, asserting that Cardano is now 10 times more robust than it was in previous cycles. The long-term prospects appear promising, however, the short-term market sentiment indicates that a cautious approach is preferable. Gambardello said that the move to a fully decentralized, community-owned blockchain is one of the most important changes that makes him more optimistic. This important change happened after the Chang Upgrade went live on September 1. Gambardello said that the update has strengthened Cardano’s base, making it a more stable and independent network. However, this is only one part of the story. Cardano: 10x Stronger Than Last Cycle At This Moment. 🌐 Owned By Community ❌ IOG Burned Keys ⚡ Hydra Scaling 📈 Higher Market Cap Position 🤝 Massive Partnerships 🛡️ Unmatched L1 Security 💰 DeFi Ecosystem 🐻 Survived The Bear As Top 10 — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) October 6, 2024 One of the major steps that Cardano took to signify its full shift into community administration was the termination of its genesis keys. Leading this milestone adds another level of security and decentralization to the blockchain, thanks to the efforts of Input Output Global (IOG). According to Gambardello, these elements make Cardano’s network far more robust than it was in earlier cycles. Furthermore, Cardano’s Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, extends the network’s appeal. Hydra’s objective is to enhance transaction throughput while simultaneously preserving high levels of security and decentralization. This solution could provide Cardano with a competitive advantage, particularly in its pursuit of dominating the competition with other top networks such as Ethereum, as scalability is a significant obstacle for many blockchains. Cardano has also experienced a substantial increase in its market position. ADA rated 12th in the crypto market and had a market cap of $2.997 billion in 2020. At the time of writing, Cardano maintains a market capitalization of $12.64 billion. Despite recent underperformance, Cardano’s resilience during the 2022 and 2023 market decline has kept it in the top 10 for an extended period. Meanwhile, with technical indicators suggesting a cautious outlook for investors, Cardano (ADA) is presently in a bearish territory in the market. By November 7, 2024, the price of Cardano is expected to climb by 16.86%, according to CoinCodex, to over $0.412024. At 49, the Fear & Greed Index says traders are neutral even at this potential upward trajectory. The price volatility of Cardano had been at 5.70% with 60% positivity, boasting 18 out of 30 days in the green in the last 30 days. Based on these factors, many analysts believe that today isn’t probably the best time to make investments in Cardano.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Investors Flock to Fidelity’s FBTC: $235 Million in Two Days

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported significant inflows totalling $235 million on Monday. Fidelity’s FBTC led the way with the highest daily inflows. Other prominent ETFs, like BlackRock’s IBIT and Bitwise’s BITB, also saw substantial inflows. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. experienced a significant inflow of $235 million, marking the second consecutive day of inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with $103.68 million in inflows. Following close behind, BlackRock’s IBIT, the most prominent spot Bitcoin ETF by net assets, also saw a substantial inflow of $97.88 million. This comes after IBIT reported no inflows on Friday, making Monday’s figures particularly noteworthy. While Fidelity and BlackRock led the inflow race, other Bitcoin ETFs also reported positive results. Bitwise’s BITB recorded net inflows of $13.09 million, further adding to the overall momentum seen on Monday. Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB also posted solid numbers, bringing in $12.63 million in net inflows. VanEck’s HODL was another ETF that saw gains, with inflows of $5.37 million, while Invesco’s BTCO brought in $2.53 million. These smaller inflows still contribute to the broader picture of growing investor interest in BTC ETFs. Interestingly, despite the positive trend for most of these products, Grayscale’s GBTC and six other ETFs saw no inflows on Monday. This might be a temporary pause, as GBTC typically plays a significant role in the ETF market. However, focusing on other products could indicate shifting investor preferences or market strategies. Alongside the significant inflows, the total trading volume for the 12 Bitcoin ETFs rose slightly on Monday. The volume reached $1.22 billion, up from $1.19 billion on Friday and $1.13 billion on Thursday. This steady increase in volume shows continued interest and activity in the Bitcoin ETF market. In contrast to Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw no inflows on Monday. This follows a more mixed performance in the days prior, with $7.39 million in inflows on Friday but $3.2 million in outflows on Thursday. The total trading volume for the nine Ethereum ETFs dropped to $118.43 million on Monday, down from $148.01 million on Friday. While Bitcoin continues attracting investor interest, Ethereum ETFs have seen more volatility recently. This could be due to various market factors, including price movements and broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price had dipped 0.80% over the past 24 hours to $62,500. Meanwhile, ether, Ethereum’s native token, declined by 1.51% to trade around $2,442. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC and ETH’s 24-hour trading volumes are up over 50% and 28%. These price movements explain the lack of inflows for Ethereum ETFs, as investors are more focused on Bitcoin during this period. Despite the dip in bitcoin’s price, the positive inflows and rising trading volumes suggest that investors remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. Your email address will not be published.

The firm anticipates robust growth in advertising revenue, projecting a 21% year-over-year increase.

Wednesday, 09 Oct 2024 NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday, with a surge in technology shares driving a broader market rebound that saw the Nasdaq Composite achieve its strongest performance in nearly three weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126.13 points, or 0.30 percent, to 42,080.37. The S&P 500 added 55.19 points, or 0.97 percent, to 5,751.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 259.01 points, or 1.45 percent, to 18,182.92. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with technology and communication services leading the gainers by adding 2.12 percent and 1.07 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and materials led the laggards by losing 2.63 percent and 0.37 percent, respectively. Investors' confidence has grown, as many believe the Federal Reserve is making progress in controlling inflation without triggering a recession. "What we're cautioning investors is not to read too much into each data point," said Todd Walsh, CEO and chief technical analyst at Alpha Cubed Investments. "The Fed seems to be on track from what we're looking at." However, concerns about the potential economic impact of the hurricane season remain. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic warned on Tuesday that the effects of the current hurricane season could extend beyond six months. He cited the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene and expressed the hope that the approaching Hurricane Milton would not cause similar levels of destruction. The easing of rising U.S. Treasury yields provided a boost to tech stocks, but interest rate policy remains the primary driver for traders and the broader U.S. equity markets. Investors are now gearing up for the start of the earnings season, which will gain momentum on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. In addition, they are closely watching for the next major data release on consumer inflation, expected on Thursday. Report it to us. Thank you for your report!

NEXT | With Darkmoon Faire and Timewalking, this week is the best for the ... This year isn’t just another anniversary: with World of Warcraft turning 20, the game is getting a massive anniversary event that will let us relive old glories, collect plenty of loot, and even show off our favorite transmogs. The event is so large that it will take up an entire (minor) patch cycle, with all of patch 11.0.5 dedicated to the anniversary. The patch launches on October 22, and we’ll be able to participate in the anniversary celebration through November and December. But let’s get to the details! Here’s everything that’s happening for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday: If you prefer, you can consume the above information in video form, though if you do I have to assume that it has not in fact been 20 years for you.Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart. This is a woman who has been in a six-hour Blackrock Depths run with countless deaths that fell apart before making it to the last boss. I feel you here, Holly, though I am hopeful my current guild can handle the new raid’s 13 bosses without falling apart.While this event comprises the majority of patch 11.0.5, there are a couple of new things in the patch that aren’t directly related to the anniversary:More goodies for Dracthyr! The formerly Evoker-only race will get new classes (Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, and Warlock) and a special Skyriding talent that will let them soar in a squadron of their fellow Dracthyr.An update to Shamans’ Ascendance form, with variants themed after different elements.I think it’s looking like a fun patch, with plenty to keep us occupied until whatever Blizzard has planned for 11.0.7. I’ll be seeing you at the Trial of Style.Originally published September 4, 2024; updated October 8, 2024.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Dracthyr Classes, Patch 11.0.5, WoW AnniversaryAdvertisement Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart.

Title: Industry Veteran Jeff Sagansky Rebukes Hollywood Studios for Decisions Leading to ‘Unbelievable Cataclysm in the Business’
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/the-grill-peter-guber-jeff-sagansky/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T21:33:43Z

TheGrill 2024: Sagansky and Peter Guber debate the transformative shift caused by the end of TV profits and rise of streaming ambitions Investor Jeff Sagansky took Hollywood to task for decisions that have led to a massive destruction of value and are causing an “unbelievable cataclysm in the business,” speaking in a keynote interview at TheWrap’s Grill conference on Tuesday. “You’re seeing the traditional business collapse,” he said in a conversation with entertainment entrepreneur Peter Guber and TheWrap’s editor in chief Sharon Waxman. “And at the same time, you’re seeing all this predatory behavior from the streamers and the two of them together are causing unbelievable cataclysm in the business that we both love.” Sagansky accused Hollywood’s traditional studios of accelerating the decline of linear television by choosing to abandon programming in favor of streaming platforms, which led to what he called “predatory” behavior from streamers. “It’s still [a] $150 billion value business in terms of revenues,” he added, noting that major sports like the NBA, MLB and NFL alone represent a $40 billion business, much smaller by contrast. Sagansky also predicted that the four leading streamers — Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney/Hulu and Max — would form an entertainment oligopoly that is likely to draw scrutiny from government regulators. Sagansky highlighted a total loss of $190 billion in value in the stock prices of major entertainment companies including Warner Bros Discovery, Disney and Paramount, noting that television, the traditional driver of the entertainment industry for half a century, has lost “almost half” of its audience. Guber, another Hollywood veteran and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment and the Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner, noted that amid mass layoffs, steep cuts in production, and an anxious search for streaming profitability, there’s more uncertainty in Hollywood than ever. “There will be blood, just like the movie, but there will also be opportunity,” Guber said. “Don’t give up on entertainment. It’s been around for thousands of years. It’s not going to go away in 2025.” During the conversation, Sagansky said he is still astounded by how entertainment companies got to this point: by pushing their film and TV libraries to Netflix in response to the decline of the DVD market in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “When streaming starts, people have a choice they can make, and they make it. So what does cable do? They raised the prices. They produced less programming at a time when the building was on fire,” Sagansky said. “They just looked at their cash cow and said ‘OK, it’s over,’ and that was a fundamental mistake.” While there are differences between live sports and the rest of entertainment, Guber believes there’s one key similarity to finding success in both worlds: find a position as the bridge between artist and audience. As part of the ownership groups behind the Dodgers and Warriors, he sees those teams’ venues — the new Chase Center in San Francisco and the venerable Dodger Stadium in L.A. — as “cathedrals” that foster generational connections between teams and fans. And he said he tries to make those venues into places that people feel active in the story being told during the game. “You have to find your way through, to be active in your own rescue,” Guber said. “Don’t wait just for the government to give you a clear path. Create your own path. If you don’t, you will be on the dustbin of history.” Sagansky and Guber also discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence on filmmaking and whether it will expand or curtail opportunities for filmmakers. To see that debate, check out the clip above. (Full interview to follow.) During Tuesday’s TheGrill, five other business panels tackled different aspects of AI in Hollywood. In a panel focused on how to balance “innovation and ethics” actor and director Justine Bateman said AI would “burn the industry to the ground” by eliminating numerous job functions, which Edouard Harris, CTO of Gladstone AI, predicted that Hollywood would break off into a two-pronged system of those supporting and not supporting AI implementation. In another panel moderated by Waxman, Fox Corp. CTO Melody Hildebrandt called on the industry to take a long view on AI and be “peers to big tech in the exploitation of it.” And in a spotlight conversation, Jeffrey Bennett, SAG-AFTRA’s general counsel, broke down the timeline for what needs to happen for AI protections to be adopted nationwide. And in an afternoon session about balancing the protection of creative rights with opportunities, Alexandra Shannon, head of strategic development at CAA, detailed the creation of theCAAvault to store actors’ likenesses for use in other AI-generated applications with legal consent. Not all the day’s event dealt with AI. Two panels featured top journalists like former New York Times staffer Laura Holson, Oliver Darcy and former LA Times Executive Director Kevin Merida, discussing the state of the media industry. And in a session centered on redefining success in sports and business, WNBA Champion Sue Bird and soccer legend Megan Rapinoe, along with Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin, discussed how mainstream traction for women’s sports continues to be met with gaslighting and industry resistance. “The goalpost is moving,” Rapinoe said.

Title: Nuveen Sells 701 Brickell for $443M in Near-Record Miami Office Deal
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/10/nuveen-701-brickell-morning-calm-management/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T21:08:21Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Nuveen Real Estate sold the 701 Brickell office building for $443 million to Morning Calm Management, marking the second-largest office transaction in Miami history, JLL announced. The deal comes about eight years after Zara founder Amancio Ortega’s $540 million purchase of the Southeast Financial Center, a 55-story building in nearby Downtown Miami, which remains the market’s top office sale. Since at least April, Nuveen had 701 Brickell on the market for $500 million. The New York-based investor purchased the 1.1 million-square-foot tower for $172 million in 2002, according to property records. JLL’s Manny De Zárraga, Matt McCormack, Ike Ojala, Hermen Rodriguez and Mike McDonald brokered the recent sale. Last month, hedge fund Elliott Management was under contract to buy the 32-story tower for about $450 million, Bloomberg reported. Besides Boca Raton-based Morning Calm Management, the new ownership includes an undisclosed partner. Representatives for Morning Calm Management, Nuveen Real Estate, JLL and Elliott Management did not respond to requests for comment. Some of the biggest names in finance — Apollo Global Management, BlackRock and Point72 Asset Management — have set up shop at 701 Brickell since the pandemic. Last year, Pura Vida, a popular fast-casual chain, opened a 5,000-square-foot cafe on the ground floor. The property, which was completed 1986, also recently underwent a $30 million renovation. Thanks to these high-profile, high-flying tenants, Brickell — Miami’s financial district — has been home to large office transactions, despite the rise of remote work. Last year, Nuveen bought the nearby 801 Brickell office for $250 million. The asking rent for office space in the district remains the highest in the city, averaging at $93.73 per square foot per year, according to Avison Young.

Title: BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (MUI) Announces Tender Offer in Conjunction with Conversion to an Unlisted Closed-End Interval Fund Structure
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/blackrock-municipal-income-fund-inc-mui-announces-tender-offer-in-conjunction-with-conversion-to-an-unlisted-closedend-interval-fund-structure-93CH-3654265
Time Published: 2024-10-08T20:48:05Z
Full Content:
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Advisors, LLC (BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)) announced today that on October 15, 2024, BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) will commence a tender offer to purchase up to 50% of the Fund's outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98% of the Fund's net asset value (NAV) per common share, as described in further detail below (the Tender Offer). The Tender Offer will expire on November 15, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended. The Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined at the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on November 18, 2024 (or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended). If the Tender Offer is oversubscribed, the Fund will purchase shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis, with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their shares purchased. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Fund will purchase all of a shareholder's common shares tendered in the Tender Offer. Payment for shares tendered and accepted is expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. The terms and conditions of the Fund's tender offer will be set forth in an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal, and related documents, which will be distributed to the Fund's common shareholders. The Fund will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which will include an Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal. As previously announced, the Fund will be converting from an exchange-listed, closed-end fund to an unlisted closed-end fund that conducts periodic repurchases of its shares, also known as an interval fund (the Conversion). Following completion of the Tender Offer, the Fund's common shares will continue to trade on the NYSE prior to the Conversion until the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE, which will be announced at a later date. It is currently expected that the Conversion will occur in the first quarter of 2025, on such date as will be announced by the Fund at a later date. Shareholders who continue to hold common shares of the Fund following the completion of the Tender Offer, but who do not wish to hold shares of the Fund following the Conversion to an unlisted interval fund, may sell their shares in the normal course on the NYSE prior to the effective date of the Conversion. Please note that, following the Conversion, the Fund's common shares will no longer trade on a stock exchange and shareholders will therefore have limited options to sell their shares outside of the Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the Fund's outstanding shares. IMPORTANT NOTICE This press release is for informational purposes only and is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities of the Fund and the above statements are not intended to constitute an offer to participate in any tender offer.

Title: Equitable Holdings, Inc. (EQH): Dirt Cheap Stock to Invest In Now

We recently compiled a list of the 7 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) stands against the other the Dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. The stock market is at a turning point after one of the longest bull runs in recent history. With major market indices close to all-time highs, valuations are getting out of hand. Likewise, the earnings season has seen increased volatility, though, with some significant selling of semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks that used to draw investors. Soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are complicating the situation and triggering risk aversions in the market. Investors are becoming increasingly cautious and resorting to safe-haven assets due to concerns about a full-blown war in the Middle East that could seriously impact the global economy. READ ALSO: 10 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years and Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks. Growing geopolitical tensions have been a factor in the stock market’s erratic start to October. According to Barbara Doran, founder of BD8 Capital Partners, things getting out of hand in the Middle East could cause stocks to decline. Surveys of public opinion already indicate that jitters are rising in the market. A gauge of consumer confidence saw its most significant one-month drop in over three years last week. Furthermore, the National Federation of Independent Business reports that a recent survey of confidence among small-business owners dropped more than anticipated in early September, maintaining the gauge below its 50-year average for 32 straight months. “We’re in a Goldilocks moment for the U.S. economy,” said Rich Nuzum, chief investment strategist at Mercer. “But Goldilocks moments are rare, and they tend not to last long. So when does something go bump in the night?” While the market is priced at a premium due to the artificial intelligence frenzy, it does not mean there are no bargains. There are dozens of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now that are trading at discounted valuations depicted by low price-to-earnings multiple and solid underlying fundamentals. Interest rate reduction was expected to benefit small-cap stocks. That isn’t happening. The Federal Reserve’s dramatic interest rate cut two weeks ago has caused the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 index to fall by 0.5%, lagging behind the S&P 500’s 1.3% gain. According to Bank of America, investors should be aware of a few important US stocks while navigating the current market climate. In a note to clients, strategist Nigel Tupper stated that a combination of improving global earnings cycle, easier monetary policy in the US as inflation returns to the target level, and China’s recent multifaceted stimulus appears supportive of equity markets and cyclicals. It is important to note that not all investments will yield significant returns, considering valuations have gotten out of hand with the S&P 500 at an all-time high. Nevertheless, long-term investors can make substantial gains by selecting solid growth stocks trading at discounted valuations. An undervalued company backed by excellent financial fundamentals, such as robust revenue and earnings growth, will always elicit strong interest from professional investors. Therefore, it is likely to enjoy significant share price appreciations down the line. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that declining interest rates and rising real wages will contribute to a modest increase in global economic growth this year and next year, which is one of the reasons to be bullish about dirt-cheap stocks. Our Methodology To compile the list of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now, we sifted through screeners and reports, scanning for high-quality stocks trading at discounted valuations. From an initial list of 20 stocks, we settled on the top seven stocks that were trading under a forward P/E of 10, as of October 7, and were the most widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 6.04 Number of Hedge Fund holders as of Q2: 44 Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) is a dirt cheap stock to invest in to diversify an investment portfolio in the financial services sector. The company has been navigating a challenging environment depicted by changing consumer preferences and changes in monetary policy. To increase cash generation by 50% and EPS growth of 12–15% annually by 2027, Equitable Holdings’ long-term prospects remain solid. Notwithstanding probable obstacles in the financial services industry, the company’s management is still optimistic about accomplishing these objectives. Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) delivered solid second-quarter results driven by Asset under management of $0.9 billion with net inflows of $2.3 billion for Retirement and $1.5 billion in Wealth Management. Net income in the quarter totalled $428 million or $1.23 a share. The company continues to see robust organic growth momentum across businesses, highlighted by record Retirement net inflows. Analysts upgraded their 2025 EPS projections from $7.19 to $7.30 in June 2024, a sign of optimism over the company’s earnings prospects. With this upward revision, Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) appears to be moving closer to its long-term financial goals. Equitable Holdings has taken the initiative to establish strategic alliances to strengthen its market position and expand its range of products. Notable partnerships include AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which are anticipated to propel growth in the business’s RILA division. Particularly, the BlackRock Life Path Paycheck product has been cited as having the ability to propel Equitable Holdings’ growth.

Title: Bitcoin Price Manipulation Linked To HBO’s Satoshi Revelation, Expert Cautions

After days of anticipation, HBO is set to release its highly awaited documentary exploring the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin (BTC). While many are eager to uncover the individual behind this pseudonym, one expert warns that the documentary could lead to significant price manipulation in the Bitcoin market before its release. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), market analyst OxNobler cautioned that while the focus may be on Nakamoto’s identity, the real issue lies in the potential “market manipulation” allegedly orchestrated by HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has long puzzled the cryptocurrency community, with various theories emerging over the past decade. As recently reported by Bitcoinist, one prominent candidate is Len Sassaman, a developer known for his work on remailer technology, a precursor to Bitcoin. Proponents of this theory point to several key facts, such as technical contributions, collaboration with Hal Finney, the first recipient of a BTC transaction, and a memorial to Sassaman encoded in the blockchain. While many previously believed that Hal Finney was the man behind the Nakamoto pseudonym, new evidence has surfaced, prompting an ongoing re-examination of the mystery. However, OxNobler warns that the current media push to reveal Nakamoto’s identity may have another purpose. The expert highlights the documentary’s release date, which coincides with key financial events, including the US Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut on September 18, the upcoming US elections and the confirmed $16 billion payout by FTX to creditors affected by its collapse in 2022. These factors, combined with potential changes to China’s cryptocurrency regulations, suggest that the revelation of Nakamoto’s identity could have far-reaching implications beyond mere price fluctuations, according to OxNobler. The expert emphasizes the involvement of large institutional investors such as asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity, major players in the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) space and Warner Bros. According to OxNobler’s analysis, these entities significantly impact the market, often initiating bull runs or selling off at the peak of excitement, with the upcoming documentary event perhaps having the same results for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, OxNobler speculates that HBO may adopt one of two bullish approaches in the documentary. In a “moderate scenario,” the film could present several candidates as possible identities for Satoshi Nakamoto without definitively naming one. Alternatively, in an “all-in scenario,” the expert suggests that the HBO documentary might explicitly name the individual behind the Nakamoto alias and reveal that they passed away long ago. The expert believes this revelation would mean that no one would have access to Nakamoto’s substantial holdings, potentially removing over 5% of the total Bitcoin supply from circulation and having a bullish effect on prices. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $62,350 after the volatility at the end of last week saw the largest cryptocurrency on the market retreat to $59,500.

Title: What went wrong at CVS?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Pharmacy chains are in crisis The pharmacy industry is in crisis. That's especially true at CVS, where layoffs are piling on top of layoffs — and the future of the company is in question. CVS Health announced this month that it is laying off 2,000 workers, CNN said, as part of an effort to "slash costs" across the company. That's on top of the 5,000 layoffs it announced last year, and after the company closed around 900 stores in recent years. CVS and other drug store chains are "struggling" due to falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, CNN said. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," said a company spokesperson. CVS' problems are also "very specific to the company," said Axios. In addition to its pharmacies, CVS is also a "major insurer" — it bought Aetna in 2017 — as well as a pharmacy benefit manager. Yes, "retail pharmacy in general is struggling," but CVS' challenges "could just be the specific businesses it has combined," Axios said. That's why company leaders are reportedly considering breaking up those businesses — an extraordinary move in an era where "vertical integration is all the rage." Escape your echo chamber.

"Satisfaction with brick-and-mortar pharmacies dropped 10 points in 2024," said Time. Customers report short-staffed outlets with "long lines and frustrating experiences." It's not just CVS: Rite Aid recently emerged from bankruptcy, and Walgreens is planning to close one-fourth of its roughly 8,600 stores. Customers simply didn't return to brick-and-mortar stores after the pandemic, preferring cheaper online alternatives. "The current pharmacy model is not sustainable," Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in June. That affects communities. The mass closure of retail pharmacies is a "growing worry for health experts," said the Missouri Independent. The problem is "most acute" in places with low incomes — "urban cores" and rural areas where pharmacies are the "convenience stores of the health care system." That makes getting necessary medications a growing challenge for the people who live in those places. "When those community pharmacies close, communities lose critical access," said one expert. One other factor in the struggles of CVS and its industry: "Heavy competition" from Amazon and Walmart, said the Los Angeles Times. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) also play a role — they have "significant control" over how much insurers pay pharmacies for medications and have worked to push down those reimbursement costs. That pushes down pharmacy profitability. One irony: CVS owns Caremark, a PBM. "That's made the drug retail business more healthy," said one analyst — but it still hasn't made CVS "immune to market forces," said the Times. CVS' board is looking at "splitting the company," said The Wall Street Journal. That could be difficult. The spun-off businesses "might struggle to flourish on their own." The mergers with Aetna and Caremark were supposed to "bring down costs and give patients more convenient, accessible care." That didn't pan out. Now the future of the company is in limbo, the Journal said: CVS' board "isn't expected to make a decision soon."

Title: FAANG and data center stocks are a buy to cash in on AI's next phase, strategist says
URL: https://qz.com/faang-data-center-stocks-cash-in-on-ais-next-phase-1851668061
Time Published: 2024-10-08T18:29:00Z

Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): The chairman of Foxconn said the AI boom “still has time to go.” Chip makers such as Nvidia are up on the news today. Where do you see the next phase of artificial intelligence expansion coming from? TEJAS DESSAI (TD): We expect it to play out in several phases. Currently, the first phase focuses on building the infrastructure that is needed to run, train, and deploy these AI models. And in this particular phase, clearly, you need semiconductors that are specialized — the chips that Nvidia (NVDA) provides or companies like AMD (AMD) or Intel (INTC) are even trying to provide. Now, on the other hand, you have companies like Broadcom (AVGO) that want to participate in this revolution through ASIC-type chips. There’s a wide area of other chips, as well. But beyond that, we also anticipate the broader data center industry being very well positioned here, as that infrastructure build-out happens at a very large scale, as well. So it’s clearly still early days in this revolution; we expect a large number of companies within the semiconductor value chain to participate in this. But beyond that, you have the hyperscalers with their own play. You have the data center operators and then, eventually, a much broader area of network infrastructure that will play a role in bringing these AI systems to the common masses. AM: Data centers are going to be a big part of the next phase of AI. What companies do you see taking advantage of it? TD: What’s happening now is you are seeing an increasing mix of AI-specific workloads come into the data center equation. And AI workloads are extremely computer-intensive. They’re energy-intensive. They need a very different kind of memory, very different kind of storage systems, very different kind of networking solutions, cooling systems, power requirements. So it’s really a breadth of innovation that we are seeing here with companies participating in this across the spectrum. In the first phase, obviously, you’re starting to see the semiconductor players benefit from this. But as we see more and more AI clusters being deployed, you could see an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions. And you have companies across the spectrum there that play into that equation. And from there on, we expect companies that specialize in providing comprehensive data center solutions — complete clusters of AI that the average S&P 500 enterprise can leverage. So you talk about data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) or Next DC and several others around the world, we expect these companies to be able to participate in this revolution through infrastructure provisioning. At the same time, you have your traditional hyperscalers, the FAANG names that build these massive computing facilities and really sell that capacity through their cloud franchises. You have Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) for sure, Google (GOOGL) Cloud, even companies like IBM (IBM) benefiting from that revolution. As they see incremental growth within their cloud franchises, they will be compelled to invest more significantly in building this infrastructure, which, again, benefits a large area of component providers in that list. AM: Gotcha. So a big driver in economic growth over the last couple of years has been these big tech companies — their stocks are way up. Would you recommend that investors continue to invest in Big Tech going into the fourth quarter and beyond into 2025? TD: Our advice to our clients has been to focus on adding exposure to the ancillary areas around this new revolution that is forming. Data centers are obviously top of mind. You need to have some sort of exposure to the entire data center value chain if you want to participate within the AI revolution. Beyond that, you can look at the consumer semiconductor ecosystem.

Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): The chairman of Foxconn said the AI boom “still has time to go.” Chip makers such as Nvidia are up on the news today. Where do you see the next phase of artificial intelligence expansion coming from? TEJAS DESSAI (TD): We expect it to play out in several phases. Currently, the first phase focuses on building the infrastructure that is needed to run, train, and deploy these AI models. And in this particular phase, clearly, you need semiconductors that are specialized — the chips that Nvidia (NVDA) provides or companies like AMD (AMD) or Intel (INTC) are even trying to provide. Now, on the other hand, you have companies like Broadcom (AVGO) that want to participate in this revolution through ASIC-type chips. There’s a wide area of other chips, as well. But beyond that, we also anticipate the broader data center industry being very well positioned here, as that infrastructure build-out happens at a very large scale, as well. So it’s clearly still early days in this revolution; we expect a large number of companies within the semiconductor value chain to participate in this. But beyond that, you have the hyperscalers with their own play. You have the data center operators and then, eventually, a much broader area of network infrastructure that will play a role in bringing these AI systems to the common masses. AM: Data centers are going to be a big part of the next phase of AI. What companies do you see taking advantage of it? TD: What’s happening now is you are seeing an increasing mix of AI-specific workloads come into the data center equation. And AI workloads are extremely computer-intensive. They’re energy-intensive. They need a very different kind of memory, very different kind of storage systems, very different kind of networking solutions, cooling systems, power requirements. So it’s really a breadth of innovation that we are seeing here with companies participating in this across the spectrum. In the first phase, obviously, you’re starting to see the semiconductor players benefit from this. But as we see more and more AI clusters being deployed, you could see an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions. And you have companies across the spectrum there that play into that equation. And from there on, we expect companies that specialize in providing comprehensive data center solutions — complete clusters of AI that the average S&P 500 enterprise can leverage. So you talk about data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) or Next DC and several others around the world, we expect these companies to be able to participate in this revolution through infrastructure provisioning. At the same time, you have your traditional hyperscalers, the FAANG names that build these massive computing facilities and really sell that capacity through their cloud franchises. You have Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) for sure, Google (GOOGL) Cloud, even companies like IBM (IBM) benefiting from that revolution. As they see incremental growth within their cloud franchises, they will be compelled to invest more significantly in building this infrastructure, which, again, benefits a large area of component providers in that list. AM: Gotcha. So a big driver in economic growth over the last couple of years has been these big tech companies — their stocks are way up. Would you recommend that investors continue to invest in Big Tech going into the fourth quarter and beyond into 2025? TD: Our advice to our clients has been to focus on adding exposure to the ancillary areas around this new revolution that is forming. Data centers are obviously top of mind. You need to have some sort of exposure to the entire data center value chain if you want to participate within the AI revolution. Beyond that, you can look at the consumer semiconductor ecosystem. You can look at cloud computing ecosystem because ultimately you will see a large breadth of these technology companies participating in this cycle and benefiting from that growth, as well.

Title: Nvidia notches fifth day of gains as Wall Street stays bullish on AI

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 4% in Tuesday, notching its fifth straight day of gains. Wall Street analysts at KeyBanc, Citi (C), Bernstein, and several other investment firms reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week. KeyBanc analysts raised their fiscal year 2025 sales outlook for Nvidia from $128.5 billion to $130.6 billion, with Nvidia’s new flagship Blackwell AI chips contributing $7 billion to fourth quarter revenues. That’s higher than Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $125.6 billion for 2025 revenue, according to Bloomberg data. Even as production of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips ramps up, KeyBanc said in a note to investors Monday that demand for Nvidia’s prior AI chip models — H100s and H200s — “remains extremely robust.” Nvidia shares are up nearly 14% over the past week and 190% from last year. Wedbush analysts said “another positive data point” for Nvidia is a potential new wave of funding for AI startups. The Information reported Monday that OpenAI’s staggering $6.6 billion funding round will likely drive a wave of new AI investments. New funding for AI-related startups would, in turn, fuel demand for Nvidia's AI chips. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson said on Tuesday that the report is an indication "that there is little likelihood AI spending growth pauses through much (if not all of 2025) to NVDA's benefit." Nvidia is also looking to prove its worth beyond AI hardware. At its AI Summit in D.C. this week, the company is attempting to highlight the strength of its AI software offerings in a bid to show that it’s more than just a chipmaker. Adding to the wave of positive press for Nvidia was the announcement of Foxconn's (2354.TW) new megafactory assembling Nvidia's AI servers. The chair of the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Young Liu, said during an annual event in Taipei Tuesday that Foxconn is building the world’s largest factory assembling Nvidia GB200 servers in Mexico, according to the Financial Times. Liu said there is “crazy” demand for Nvidia’s latest AI chips. The move will reduce Nvidia’s reliance on China amid rising trade tensions. Nvidia and Foxconn said they're also working to build Taiwan's fastest supercomputer. Nvidia isn’t the only semiconductor company that’s thriving. Citing WSTS semiconductor industry data, JPMorgan (JPM) said Tuesday that sector-wide sales rose 28% in August from last year. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 [the second half of 2024 and 2025] and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25 [the 2024 and 2025 calendar years].” The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) both rose more than 1% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, chipmakers in China faced a different fate Tuesday. After China’s economic planning agency failed to live up to the market’s hope for more stimulus measures, China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) fell 18%. Investors had expected stimulus initiatives to boost China’s semiconductor sector. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Dynasty Financial Partners has closed a minority capital raise, saying it will use the proceeds from this investment round to enhance its technology-enabled wealth management solutions and business services. The round was supported by new investors BlackRock and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, existing investor The Charles Schwab Corp., and several long-standing investors and members of Dynasty’s board of directors, the company said in a Tuesday (Oct. 8) press release. Dynasty will continue to make “significant investments in technology, talent and capabilities” to better serve clients, Dynasty CEO and founder Shirl Penney said in the release. “In addition, enhancing our fortress balance sheet will allow us to provide more capital in support of our clients who are looking to grow their businesses via M&A or achieve succession planning goals,” Penney said. Together with its strong balance sheet, Dynasty has access to growth capital via a $50 million unused credit facility, according to the release. The company’s offerings include integrated technology, services, turnkey asset management program, digital lead generation services, capital solutions and investment bank, the release said. Its customers include clients who own and operate independent registered investment advisories (RIAs) and its network currently includes 58 network partner firms representing 400 advisors with $100 billion in platform assets, per the release. Dynasty Chairman of the Board Harvey Golub said in the release that the roster of backers participating in the company’s latest investment round includes “one of the largest custodians, asset managers and banks in the world.” “I feel it speaks to the remarkable growth of the RIA space and innovative companies like Dynasty who are driving positive change in the industry for financial advisors and their clients,” Golub said. In another recent development in this space, wealth management platform Envestnet said in July that it plans to go private in a deal with Bain Capital. Envestnet entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Bain Capital in a transaction that values it at $4.5 billion. Also in July, Earned Wealth raised $200 million for its business that advises doctors on their professional and personal finances. Earned Wealth provides one interconnected platform that doctors can use to consult with wealth management experts on topics like financial planning, tax planning, wealth management and investing.

Major U.S. indexes were higher at midday Tuesday as tech stocks surged and oil prices eased. The Nasdaq jumped 1%, while the S&P 500 climbed about 0.6% and the Dow was little changed. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose as partner Foxconn touted strong demand for its servers and Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) and MDU Resources Group (MDU) gained after S&P Global announced they were part of changes in its indexes. DocuSign is set to replace MDU in the S&P MidCap 400 index, while MDU is moving to the S&P SmallCap 600 index, bumping Chuy Holdings (CHUY). Beaten down Humana (HUM) shares got a lift as Bernstein analysts upgraded the stock, saying the recent drop made the shares attractive. The decline in oil prices sent shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and others in the oil industry lower. Prices for gold and other key metals declined, sending shares of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and rival miners down. Roblox (RBLX) shares sank after short seller Hindenburg Research claimed the online gaming platform overstated its user data and was a dangerous site for kids. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The dollar was up on the euro and yen, but lost ground to the pound. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower. TradingView

NEXT | The Queue: Darkmoon Faire Mystic Mage World of Warcraft‘s current expansion The War Within has been out since August 26 (with early access beginning on August 22), and due to the published 2024 roadmap we already know that the first post-release update will be patch 11.0.5. This patch brings the 20th Anniversary celebration for World of Warcraft to Azeroth, and we now know it’s coming out the week of October 22! By coming out on October 22 we have our first strong suggestion that The War Within is going to emulate Dragonflight‘s patch cadence, as eight weeks since the expansion released is right in line with the 10.x.5 patches. While patch 11.0.7 probably won’t arrive until after the anniversary event is over in January it looks like regular updates are still in the offing for TWW.What’s in patch 11.0.5 including the 20th Anniversary celebration?The 20th Anniversary celebration will be running from the release of the patch until January 6, 2025 and is promising to be a huge one, with several new events planned. These include:Two new Anniversary world bosses: Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher.Blackrock Depths will be a new 8-boss “dungeon raid” for 10-15 players that can be run on LFR, Normal, and Heroic difficulties.Upgraded Tier 2 armor appearances, with new looks for classes that weren’t around during Classic.Chromie has a new adventure at the Gates of Ahn’qiraj.There’s a lot happening with the 20th Anniversary celebration so one could assume that it’s all that’s coming, but the Anniversary and its rewards aren’t the only things we’ll see with patch 11.0.5. So far we know that it will also include:New rotation of Timewalking dungeons from Classic, including both wings of Stratholme, east and west wings of Dire Maul, Deadmines, and Zul’Farrak.Dracthyr will be finally be getting classes besides Evoker; starting with patch 11.0.5 you’ll be able to roll Dracthyr Hunter, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Warlock and Warrior.Shaman will be getting new forms for Ascendance … although it wouldn’t surprise me if glyphs arrive shortly thereafter for those who want to keep the current forms.Originally published January 29, 2024.

Join the 20th Anniversary Celebration near the Caverns of Time, spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock, ascend with a new Shaman Ascendance form, and more. Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Take part in quests and activities to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens to spend on items during the 20th Anniversary Celebration, including returning items from previous anniversaries and new ones. Join Moira Thaurissan as the bronze dragonflight grants her a look back in history, guiding us all through a journey through eight epic boss raid encounters. Players can queue for this epic raid with the Raid Finder (Group Finder Hotkey I) or create their own groups of 10 to 15 players by speaking with Moira for Normal and Heroic difficulties. Paladin Death Knight, Hunter, Mage Warrior, Druid, Priest Monk, Shaman, Evoker Warlock, Demon Hunter, Rogue We’ve modernized some very classic Tier 2 sets for all classes, including those that didn’t exist at the time these sets were introduced—such as Monks and Evokers—for a total of thirteen class sets! Each set comes as an ensemble of 9 pieces, including a cloak, making sure you look the part from head to toe. Step back in time and show off your class pride when you purchase these appearances with Bronze Celebration Tokens earned during the 20th Anniversary Celebration. Take part in a new Timewalking event that will take you through the original version of Deadmines, Zul’Farrak, Dire Maul (east and west wings), and Stratholme’s living and undead dungeons for epic new rewards. Queue up via the Adventure Journal or the Group Finder with players level 10 and above. Players will have the option to visit special vendors to get new mounts, pets, and transmog appearances. Here are just a few items you will find on the Timewalking vendors starting with the 20th Anniversary: Blizzard employees earn special service awards during their time at the company. We’ve taken inspiration from these awards to create a new mount that is fully armored in a similar style—the Coldflame Tempest mount. This blue-flamed flying mount takes after its fiery cousin, the Ashes of Al’ar, and will let you show off your own years of service to Azeroth. Players can also earn appearances based on the employee sword, shield, and crown to show off in-game, along with a version of the employee ring as a toy. Stand out with a 20-Year balloon toy and two adorable baby doomlord pets—Lil’Kaz and Lil’Doomy— you can add to your collection. For a limited time, you will also see some returning Anniversary items that can be also purchased with Bronze Celebration Tokens when you visit Storekeeper Reginald in the Celebration Pavilion and peruse his inventory. This year’s celebration event has expanded, and the bronze dragonflight have taken the activities just outside the Caverns of Time with various new and exciting things to do. Show off your transmog at the Fashion Frenzy stage hosted by Althaea. Mount up to match Abigail Cyrildotr at the Mount Mania arena and show off your mount collection. Join Lorewalker Cho at the Storyteller stage for an epic tale you can’t help but join in on. Take a photo with guildmates, venture to epic vistas, disguise yourself as your pet, cosplay as famous heroes or villains, skate on the rink, or take a balloon for a lazy ride around the event space. There’s plenty to see and do as you join the celebration in Tanaris, and it’s available to players at level 15 and above. There are gate-crashers at nearly every party, and that’s true of our anniversary celebration. We’re bringing back some classic World Bosses from the past, including Doomwalker, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and the Dragons of Nightmare, along with a couple of additional party crashers in the sands of Tanaris— the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher. Players can join in bouncing them out of the celebration beginning at level 15 to earn some great rewards and anniversary currency. Chromie is up for any challenge, but due to her unique role, she has not kept her codex in order. When asked to put together time tours of the opening of the Ahn’qiraj gate, she’s discovered things are in a jumble. She’ll need help from Azeroth’s heroes to put things to rights once more and send out of place enemies in the sands of Silithus back to where they belong. Players can queue up using the Group Finder for this 10-20 player scenario beginning at level 15. Often a thankless job, guest relations has a new volunteer, Alyx, stepping into the role with the lofty hopes of doing a better job than their predecessor. As visitors pour into the celebration, Alyx is under pressure and could use a little help making it an event to remember. Thankfully, they have found a secret-sleuthing tuskarr family who have become the perfect helpers in getting players up to speed with the tools of the secrets trade. Assist Alyx each week with resolving new guest mysteries by using your new secret-finding skills, and be on the lookout for stolen celebration goods. Follow the rumors and solve the mystery— if you can. We’re counting on you, secret finders. Players can begin working on the initial secrets beginning on October 28 with additional secrets opening up on November 4. Run down your enemies, raze their fortifications, and exchange the tokens you loot from their corpses to summon mighty reinforcements in Korrak’s Revenge, a throwback Battleground inspired by the earliest days of Alterac Valley. Players who complete the quest, “Korrak’s Revenge,” will be rewarded one of two mounts based on your character’s faction: the Stormpike Battle Ram (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde). Players taking part in the battlegrounds during the anniversary celebration can also click on the Alliance Armory or the Horde War Supplies located in the starting areas of battlegrounds to don the appearance of PvP sets from times past. Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with November’s Trading Post. Players will be able to fill the month’s bar to earn four iconic back appearance shields representing the factions of Warcraft III— Orc, Human, Night Elf, and Scourge. Spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock. Undertaking one of these new classes as a Dracthyr will allow you to choose between fighting as a Dracthyr or fighting in Visage form by activating Visage, which switches you between forms. You can additionally choose to toggle on Chosen Identity, which will automatically shift you into Dracthyr form when entering combat and Visage form when leaving combat. Dracthyr Evokers will continue to use Dracthyr form during combat, as many of their abilities emphasize their draconic nature. With the addition of new classes to Dracthyr, we are making some further adjustments to their racials. Dracthyr players will also be able to learn a new Skyriding talent called Squadron in which up to two additional Dracthyr players can join you to fly in formation as you soar through the skies. But wait, there’s more! Shaman can also look forward to new Ascendance forms to express their elemental mastery. Restoration Shaman will get a new Water form, Elemental will get a new Fire form, and Enhancement will get a new Wind form. 1920x1080, 3840x2160, 1080x1920 We look forward to celebrating all things World of Warcraft with you. We’ll see you in Azeroth!

Title: WeightWatchers is getting in on the off-brand GLP-1 game — and it's cheap
URL: https://qz.com/weight-watchers-compounded-semaglutide-1851667926
Time Published: 2024-10-08T16:54:42Z

Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know WeightWatchers (WW) announced Tuesday that it is now offering off-brand weight loss drugs for one of the cheapest prices in the industry. WeightWatchers, the once-popular points-based weight loss program, said it will be offering its members compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of the active ingredient in Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy — for $129 for the first month and then $189 a month for the subsequent months. That’s hundreds of dollars cheaper than Wegovy’s $1,349 monthly price tag. “At WeightWatchers, we have always combined proven science and personalized support to help our members achieve meaningful, lasting results. With the addition of compounded semaglutide, we are expanding our offering to include a clinical weight management solution that is both accessible and affordable,” said Tara Comonte, interim CEO of WeightWatchers, in a press release. WeightWatchers stock surged 25% following the news. This offering comes just a week after Comonte replaced outgoing CEO Sima Sistani in late September. Sistani departed the company as it struggled to adapt to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs. Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatchers acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering WeightWatchers members branded weight loss drugs such as Wegovy. But the bet hasn’t seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers’ stock is down more than 88% since the beginning of the year. The class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 27% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 61%. WeightWatchers joins other digital health care companies including Hims & Hers, Noom, and Sesame in offering cheaper alternatives to branded weight loss drugs. Typically, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications — compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand-name drugs such as Wegovy has spurred several digital health care companies to take advantage of that provision. However, there are risks. The FDA said in July that it had received reports of overdoses related to weight loss drugs, often due to confusion over proper dosing. And companies hawking compounded weight loss drugs may have to stop when the shortages end. Last week, the FDA updated its drug shortage database, marking the shortage of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound as resolved. Wegovy remains on the list.

Time Published: 2024-10-08T16:42:05Z

In today’s dynamic business environment, organizations are overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, yet the challenge remains in effectively leveraging this data to inform strategic decision-making. A recent report indicates that companies lose approximately $5.8 million annually due to inadequate data quality and analytics [1]. This alarming statistic underscores the critical need for accurate financial forecasting methods that are agile and capable of adapting to the rapidly evolving market landscape. According to the findings of a recent survey carried out by Finextra, more than two thirds of financial institutions anticipate that in five years finest artificial intelligence (AI) will have been incorporated towards improving risk management and forecasting. Traditional financial forecasting, which often relies on static spreadsheets and labour-intensive processes, is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of contemporary business operations. Therefore, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into financial forecasting is not merely advantageous but indispensable for organizations striving to navigate these complexities and achieve long-term success. The Evolution of Financial Forecasting The evolution of financial forecasting has shifted from labour-intensive, manual processes to dynamic, AI-powered methodologies Historically, financial professionals relied on the analysis of historical data and market trends to generate forecasts using fixed models. While this approach provided some degree of insight, it was inherently constrained by human error, delayed response times, and the inability to effectively integrate real-time data. AI has fundamentally transformed this landscape, allowing businesses to analyse vast volumes of data instantaneously, uncovering trends and making predictions that were previously unattainable. This transition from retrospective analysis to proactive forecasting is reshaping how organizations formulate their financial strategies. The most recent trend in this transition is the proactive rather than the traditional reactive forecasting approach made possible by making use of real-time predictive analytics and machine learning technologies available today in the financial services sector. For instance, JP Morgan’s AI-based COiN platform analysed billions of data points saving 360,000 hours of human labour in forecasting tasks done by population each year. There are changes in terms of operational excellence and exactness. Simply put, the importance of AI in the financial services industry is very high. (https://superiordatascience.com/jp-morgan-coin-a-case-study-of-ai-in-finance/ ) The Role of Predictive Analytics in Financial Forecasting Predictive analytics is central to this transformation. By utilizing historical data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques, predictive analytics enables businesses to anticipate market trends, identify potential risks, and uncover opportunities before they become evident .A key advantage of predictive analytics lies in its ability to enhance accuracy. Through the automation of extensive dataset analysis, AI significantly reduces the likelihood of human error and progressively improves the precision of forecasts. Moreover, AI-driven dashboards can seamlessly integrate real-time data from various sources, including internal accounting systems and external market indicators, ensuring that organizations have access to the most up-to-date information for informed decision-making. Key Benefits of Al-Driven Predictive Analytics Predictive analytics in financial forecasting offers several key advantages that significantly enhance decision-making processes The Future of Al-Driven Financial Forecasting As we look to the future, several transformative trends are set to shape the trajectory of AI-driven financial forecasting: Applications in Financial Services Several large banks and other financial organizations have gone a step ahead and implemented AI in predictive analytic models for financial forecasting. For example, Goldman Sachs has created an approach towards the trading of shares through the incorporation of an AI platform with machine learning thereby enabling the third part to predict prices in a fast changing market. A similar case applies to Blackrock which employs artificial intelligence to enhance the performance and risks of the holding of the investment various instruments it possesses. This is confirmed by one of the instances that tend to show how global companies are already integrating into their operations AI for sales forecasting, which they deem very important. Whether it is about changing the approach towards the management of the portfolio, or measuring the risk, or going back to the operational excellence that is being expected, or decreasing the risks of fraud, nothing is more effective than AI in financial services. (https://thesciencebrigade.com/btds/article/download/165/165/359 ) Challenges and Considerations Apart from the numerous benefits of AI, its use within the segment of financial forecasting also comes with concerns. One of such restraints is the quality of the data and its integration. This means that the models ensure much data is acquired, and such models perform well whenever the data used for their training is accurate and extensive. For financial institutions, this entails spending money on strong database systems which will permit the vertical aggregation of different types of data. Another challenge is the complexity of AI models. As AI systems become more intricate, some professionals in finance may have challenges grasping the reasoning hypotheses that generate some of the predictions. This highlights the importance of developing more understandable AI models as institutions follow AI-enhanced predictions since it helps customers understand the reasoning behind them. Next Trends in AI Systems for Financial Forecasting When trying to talk about the future, there are a number of aspects that can be able to shift the way we have been forecasting in Finance with the help of AI: (https://ijsret.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IJSRET_V10_issue1_138.pdf ) Conclusion AI-enabled dashboards are quite literally redefining the methods of predicting finances, thanks to advanced analytical abilities. Such enabling tools allow corporations, as well as the financial sectors, to fully utilize data in real-time whilst predicting trends more accurately and with better insight in order to make the decisions required. Even if challenges such as data privacy, data integration and data regulatory compliance still exist, the advantages offered by these technologies cannot be over risks. In a subsequent part of the report, companies that apply AI-enabled dashboards will enhance their competitive edge profitability in the course of trading activities in a market that is highly influenced by data. This will allow not only to enhance their financial operations and risk management but also to act in accordance with those rules. These novel perspectives will enhance the organisational financial decision-making capabilities and mitigate the operational risk associated with noncompliance. In this new age, the application of artificial intelligence tools in the analysis and planning of finances will become the new normal. Illegal barriers will be effectively mitigated by those able to embrace today’s technological changes. References 1.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose on Tuesday after Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, touted strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. Executives at Foxconn—officially named Hon Hai Precision Industry—said Tuesday at the company's annual tech day they were constructing in Mexico the world’s largest facility for assembling AI servers to house Nvidia’s GB200 chips, part of its Blackwell AI architecture. Young Liu, chair of Foxconn, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that the company is aiming to produce 20,000 GB200 NVL72 servers at the factory in 2025. HSBC analysts have estimated the price of one GB200 NVL72 server is about $3 million. Demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell system is “awfully huge,” said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn’s senior vice president of cloud enterprise solutions, at the company’s tech day. Liu told Bloomberg demand was “crazy,” echoing comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last week. Nvidia stock climbed more than 4% Tuesday, extending gains from yesterday when the company overtook Microsoft (MSFT) as America’s second-most valuable company. The stock, which closed just under $133 on Tuesday, is approaching its record closing high of $135.57, which was set on June 18. Nvidia's all-time intraday high, set on June 20, is $140.76. TradingView Nvidia shares have more than doubled this year after rebounding from a summer slump amid reports that a design flaw would delay the rollout of the Blackwell system. Those reports coincided with a sell-off of big tech stocks as earnings disappointed and Wall Street questioned the wisdom of massive AI spending. Update—October 8, 2024: This story has been updated to reflect Nvidia's share price at the market close on Tuesday.

The bank's recent third-quarter 2024 earnings report exceeded analyst expectations, with net income rising to $13.7 billion, up 8% from the previous quarter. This strong performance was driven by solid consumer banking results and increased net interest income due to higher interest rates. The bank's investment banking division has shown resilience in a challenging market, maintaining its top position in global investment banking fees. JPMorgan's recent expansion of its middle-market banking services in Europe has begun to yield results, with the bank gaining market share in a traditionally underserved segment.

The bank's blockchain-based payment network, JPM Coin, has processed over $1 trillion in transactions year-to-date, demonstrating the potential of this technology to transform financial services. The bank's strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 14.5% as of the third quarter of 2024, provides a solid foundation for growth and resilience against economic uncertainties. This strong capital base has allowed JPMorgan to increase its dividend by 5% in 2024, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend growth. As the Federal Reserve signals a potential end to its rate-hiking cycle, JPMorgan is well-positioned to benefit from a stable interest rate environment. The bank's diversified business model, spanning consumer banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking and asset and wealth management, provides resilience against sector-specific downturns. JPMorgan's strong risk management practices, evidenced by its performance during recent banking sector turbulence, and its "fortress balance sheet" philosophy instill confidence in its ability to weather potential economic headwinds. With signs of financial stability emerging and the potential for a "soft landing" scenario, JPMorgan benefits from increased lending activity and potential upticks in consumer spending and business investments.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. OPINION Welcome to Inside Economics. Every week, I take a deeper dive into some of the more left-field economic news you may have missed. To sign up to my weekly newsletter, click here. If you have a burning question about the quirks or intricacies of economics send it to liam.dann@nzherald.co.nz or leave a message in the comments section. Today we get one of the most highly anticipated Official Cash Rate calls in years. At 2pm the RBNZ will release its October Monetary Policy Review (MPR) and there’ll be no shortage of homeowners and business people hoping for significant relief. The MPR is different to the full Monetary Policy Statement we got in August. It means we’ll just get a one-page release with no press conference and no fresh forecasts. But you can still bet that every word of the release will be pored over for clues to the outlook. A 25 basis point rate cut is almost certainly baked in. But will Governor Adrian Orr and the monetary policy committee double down and deliver 50 basis points? The local bank economists have all picked that he will, but they’ve all added that it is a close call. So it’s far from a done deal. In the end, it will come down to an RBNZ judgment on just how grim the economy really is right now. Some commentators - like Greg Smith from Devon Funds Management - have even suggested that a 75 basis point cut might be warranted. That seems unlikely, as it would send panic signals to the market. The RBNZ gets another shot in November with a full Monetary Policy Statement and if it cuts by 50 bps then as well, that would send us into the new year with an OCR at 4.25%. Economists are picking the rate will fall further next year, so there is more relief on the way. ASB expects the OCR will be down to 4% by February 2025 and will reach a terminal rate of 3.25% from around mid-2025. KiwiBank economists say market traders are putting “odds-on” bets of 50 bps cuts all the way through until February. “The cash rate is priced to hit 3% by August next year, with a terminal rate around 2.5%, in line with our forecast,” they said. So there is no question relief is on its way ... it’s just a question of how fast. Check-in on the nzherald.co.nz site at 2pm for the decision and analysis. That’s my favourite question about the economy. It’s more of a prelude to a range of questions, but it draws on the seemingly endless well of pessimism that economics inspires. If things are going well, we can worry that the only way from here is down. If things are going badly, we can worry about our capacity to cope with any more bad news. Remarkably, things are going pretty well for the global economy right now. There is a chance that this optimism will flow through to New Zealand as interest rates start to fall. As discussed last week, the US economy is on a roll - its annual economic growth rate has recovered to 3% and at the weekend we saw its latest job creation data (the quirkily named non-farm payrolls) showed a big surprise on the upside. It looks like the US will avoid recession, giving the US Federal Reserve breathing space to cut rates in a measured fashion. This comes alongside a struggling Chinese economy that has already boosted iron ore prices, which will give Australia’s economy a shot in the arm. Hopefully, the stimulus will lift Chinese consumer sentiment too, which could boost prices for dairy and our other food exports like meat, wine and fruit. We might even see a much-needed lift in the number of Chinese tourists to New Zealand. So what, if anything, could derail this positive economic outlook? Since the conflict in the Middle East broadened to include Lebanon and Iran, oil prices have spiked about 10%. That’s a concern for those still worried about the tail end of inflation - not to mention being a pain for drivers who were just starting to enjoy the benefits of lower prices at the pump. Brent crude - the variety of oil that New Zealand petrol prices are pinned to - spiked above US$81 ($131) on Tuesday after the latest strikes by Israel and Hezbollah. It’s safe to say you’ll be paying more to fill up the tank this weekend. But it’s worth keeping the spike in context. It takes us back to where we were in August and we’re still a long way off this year’s high of US$90.38. Obviously, a wider war between Israel and Iran would be a disaster for the world. We’ve seen Iran launch a large-scale but ineffective missile attack against Israel and now the world is waiting on Israel’s response. The stakes are high and it’s an awful situation for the region. It would be foolish to try to pick how it all plays out. But essentially there is a binary way of looking at the economic risk. Either we’ll see an expansion of Israel’s conflict with Iran or we won’t. If Israel can be convinced (and there will be a lot of US lobbying going on) to respond in a measured way, perhaps this part of the current conflict will settle down. If that’s the case, we could see oil prices slide back as the rest of the conflict - as terrible as it all is - has less direct impact on oil supply. Iran is the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, though half of its exports go to China. If a serious and sustained conflict breaks out between Iran and Israel, there is a risk oil prices could spike back above US$100. They rose to $US130 a barrel after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These are different times though. Broadly, oil prices have been coming down over the past year, mostly due to subdued demand, with both the US and Chinese economies being sluggish. As these economies rebound we should expect oil prices to rise, regardless of the Middle East situation. The big variable in all of this is OPEC+, which still controls 40% of global supply. That’s enough that it can shift the price significantly depending on how much oil it decides to produce. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in OPEC+ and that gives it significant political sway. It’s one of the reasons the US maintains such friendly relations with the Saudis. So far it has played a neutral hand, neither boosting nor cutting production. Good news for human readers: if MIT economist Daron Acemoglu is to be believed, AI is unlikely to be able to replace more than 5% of jobs in the next decade. There, bad news for humans with KiwiSaver accounts, though, as Acemoglu is a leading voice among a growing camp of sceptics who believe AI hype has created a bubble that will likely cause a stock market crash. AI stocks - like chip maker Nvidia - have been very good to KiwiSaver funds over the past few years. Nvidia shares were worth US$12 in October 2022. Today they are worth US$125. Acemoglu, who says he is not anti-AI or even pessimistic about its long-term prospects, hit the headlines last week with his big call about the low level of jobs that AI can actually do. The Herald picked up the coverage from the Washington Post (read the full article here). It’s probably worth mentioning that 5% of jobs is still a lot of jobs. That would effectively double our unemployment rate to 10% if it happened overnight. But as promising as AI is for many things, there’s little chance it will live up to that hype, Acemolu says. “A lot of money is going to get wasted,” he says. “You’re not going to get an economic revolution out of that 5%.” He notes that four companies alone - Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms - invested more than US$50 billion into capital spending in the second quarter of this year, with much of that going towards AI. Having lived through the dotcom crash in 2000, I’ve been bothered by the risks of an AI bubble for some time (even as I’ve watched it pump my KiwiSaver account). I remain ever hopeful that we might see pricing levels rebalance in an orderly fashion as investors switch out of tech stocks and into more mainstream companies that will benefit as interest rates fall. But that’s seldom how market bubbles resolve themselves. Usually, things are much more dramatic. Acemoglu sees three scenarios - a best case, a bad case and a worst case. The best we can hopeful is the kind of gradual deflation and rebalancing of valuations, he says. There have been promising signs of this in the past few months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange, home to Nvidia, has risen just 1.2% in the past six months. In fact, it is down about 4% since its most recent peak - just before August’s “flash crash” market sell-off. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 - full of more traditional companies - has hit a series of record highs in the past couple of weeks. But the Nasdaq is still up 40% in the past year and 130% since 2019. If investors get spooked, there is still enough air in there to deflate rapidly. In Acemoglu’s second scenario, the AI hype keeps rolling for another year or so, leading to a tech stock crash that burns off corporate enthusiasm for the technology. “AI spring followed by AI winter,” he says. But there’s a third, even worse scenario. As the Washington Post puts it: “The mania goes unchecked for years, leading companies to cut scores of jobs and pump hundreds of billions of dollars into AI without understanding what they’re going to do with it, only to be left scrambling to try to rehire workers when the technology doesn’t pan out.” That could have widespread fallout for the entire global economy, Acemoglu says. Ominously, he sees a combination of the second and third scenarios as most likely. But not this year at least! US political mayhem might be a more pressing risk. As mentioned above, America’s economy has been humming along nicely. Could the upcoming election derail that? There is plenty of commentary highlighting the risks with both presidential candidates. On balance, there is probably more concern about Donald Trump and his plans for 10% tariffs on all imports, although it depends on who you ask. Elon Musk seems more concerned about Kamala Harris’ tax plans and ambitions to rein in the tech sector with price controls and other regulations. If we strip out the partisan political takes, the one big risk that remains is around an uncertain or contested election result. If we don’t get a clear result on the night, we will face weeks of recounts or even months of uncertainty if things end up going through the courts. That seems likely given how close the polling is and how high the stakes are. Markets famously hate uncertainty. Wall Street is likely to cope with either a Trump or Harris presidency. But a power vacuum for any significant length of time might be enough to spook investors and derail the current rally. This year’s Mood of the Boardroom survey of chief executives and directors showed a surge of optimism about the economic outlook from here. But one thing they weren’t so upbeat about was New Zealand’s recent economic performance. As I wrote for Inside Economics back in August, the idea of a “hard” or “soft” landing refers to whether policymakers can bring down inflation by lifting interest rates without putting the economy into recession. On that definition, New Zealand has had a hard landing. If the Reserve Bank forecasts are correct, we are currently in our third recession in two years. But interestingly, when business leaders were asked what they thought, the results weren’t a slam dunk. Some 65% gave a hard “no” to the suggestion we might have managed a soft landing. Around 20% were unsure and 15% said yes. Mitigating factors might include that the recessions so far have been shallow (albeit propped up by high net migration). Unemployment is still below 5%, a historically low level. And despite some grim headlines and high-profile business failures, the stats for credit arrears, mortgagee sales and business liquidations remain lower than they were during the GFC and the years immediately after it. There’s no question it’s a tough economy right now. But the long-term damage the period does will ultimately depend on how many jobs are lost and how many businesses fail. Here’s hoping the recovery rolls on smoothly from here and we escape with something that might still be described as “softish”. Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the New Zealand Herald.

If you have a burning question about the quirks or intricacies of economics send it to liam.dann@nzherald.co.nz or leave a message in the comments section. Today we get one of the most highly anticipated Official Cash Rate calls in years. At 2pm the RBNZ will release its October Monetary Policy Review (MPR) and there’ll be no shortage of homeowners and business people hoping for significant relief. The MPR is different to the full Monetary Policy Statement we got in August. It means we’ll just get a one-page release with no press conference and no fresh forecasts. But you can still bet that every word of the release will be pored over for clues to the outlook. A 25 basis point rate cut is almost certainly baked in. But will Governor Adrian Orr and the monetary policy committee double down and deliver 50 basis points? The local bank economists have all picked that he will, but they’ve all added that it is a close call. So it’s far from a done deal. In the end, it will come down to an RBNZ judgment on just how grim the economy really is right now. Some commentators - like Greg Smith from Devon Funds Management - have even suggested that a 75 basis point cut might be warranted. That seems unlikely, as it would send panic signals to the market.

Title: Microsoft's Stock Has One Fewer 'Buy' Rating on Wall Street Today

Optimism about AI-related growth has helped shares of Microsoft (MSFT) this year, but at least one investment bank is urging caution about what might come next. Oppenheimer analysts on Tuesday downgraded shares of Microsoft to “perform” from “outperform.” That's rare on Wall Street, with nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the software giant holding "buy" or equivalent ratings, according to Visible Alpha. Shares of Microsoft were recently up about 1%, slightly outperforming the broader market. The stock is up more than 11% for the year. "Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling," the analysts wrote Tuesday. Open AI is an independent company, but it has a "strategic partnership" with Microsoft. “Enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint.” In a September report, Oppenheimer said it was “tweaking down near term AI revenue, but tweaking up CapEx spending, mostly for Microsoft.” The company is investing in "once-in-a-generation technology," the analysts wrote, so "we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority.” Oppenheimer also said that Microsoft's shares are trading near the midpoint of the five-year range for its price-to-earnings ratio and "could trade to the lower end" down the line.

The mTBILL and mBasis products, launched on Tuesday, have no minimum investment requirements. That opens them up to a wide range of investors, including retail traders who are often unable to shore up large sums of capital like their institutional counterparts. “Retail access to tokenized RWAs, like treasuries, is a game-changer,” Midas co-founder Dennis Dinkelmeyer told Decrypt. “This is about giving retail the same access to high-quality assets that institutions enjoy.” Many real-world asset tokenized funds are targeted toward institutional investors, requiring a minimum investment of $100,000. Midas bills itself as the only RWA issuer with a regulatory-compliant offering that has no minimum investment thresholds and investor accreditation process, however. Midas’ new product based on mBasis—the firm's yield-bearing token that tracks a delta-neutral basis trading strategy—offers investors exposure to a tokenized basis trading strategy that has offered up to 25% year-to-date returns, according to the firm. The product is the first to offer full DeFi composability of a permissionless token that is regulated, the firm said. Meanwhile, the mTBILL product offers holders exposure to a lower-risk investment based on U.S. T-Bills, offering a return of roughly 5%, Midas’ website shows. Both tokenized RWAs have secured regulatory approval in Liechtenstein, making them available to retail and institutional traders in various parts of Europe, according to Midas. Early investors in the mTBill and mBASIS products can participate in an incentive program to maximize their investment returns, according to Midas. The first 100 holders of mTBILL will earn 50% APY for a limited time, which will be paid in USDC stablecoin for the first 100 holders of either mTBILL or mBasis. RWA tokenized funds have exploded in popularity in recent months. Earlier this year, BlackRock launched its BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which holds more than $500 million in assets under management, according to Etherscan data. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton's Franklin On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund, which launched several years ago, has seen its assets under management balloon to roughly $430 million, according to the investment firm's website. The firm has also expanded the fund to multiple additional chains, most recently Aptos and Avalanche. And beyond those traditional finance titans, other firms are launching RWA funds based on different underlying assets. Guggenheim Treasury Securities launched the first-ever commercialized paper fund on Ethereum earlier this month in partnership with blockchain infrastructure firm Zeconomy.

Title: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before or After a New iPhone is Released?

The launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight. However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release. This raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. Historically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). However, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. Investors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. Apple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company. As the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. In fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. While new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI. Various products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product. Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. In 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues. This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. While iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: The top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A). As of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a "buy" or "strong buy" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price. Apple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple. Apple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. Several factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. Michael M.

Nvidia (NVDA) is best known for its highly coveted artificial intelligence chips. But at its Nvidia AI Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, the Nvidia vice president of Enterprise Platforms, Bob Pette, delivered an address providing greater insights into the company’s various software platforms. Nvidia says companies ranging from AT&T (T), Deloitte, and Quantiphi to research centers like the National Cancer Institute and the SETI Institute are using its software technologies to do everything from helping employees work through software development and network engineering jobs to searching for signs of extraterrestrial life. Nvidia has a number of AI software platforms including Nvidia NIM Agent Blueprints, Nvidia NIM, and Nvidia NeMo. NIM Agent Blueprints is designed to help businesses develop generative AI applications, while NIM provides the ability to quickly put together chatbots and AI assistants. Nvidia NeMo gives companies the means to build their own custom generative AI models. Shares of Nvidia rose 3.7% following the announcement. The offerings are part of Nvidia’s strategy of ensuring that companies don’t just look to the company for AI processors but also for its software as well, driving additional revenue streams outside of hardware sales. According to Nvidia, AT&T is teaming with Quantiphi to create a conversational AI platform to assist employees with software development and financial services tasks. The University of Florida is using Nvidia’s NIM and MeMo to improve its learning management system for teaching assistants, and Deloitte is using Nvidia’s NIM Agent Blueprint alongside its own cybersecurity products. Nvidia says the National Cancer Institute is using NIM Agent Blueprint to help cut down on the time and cost of developing novel drug molecules, while the SETI Institute used the company’s Holoscan software development kit to create software for receiving and analyzing radio waves from space. Nvidia is also teaming with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh as part of its new AI Tech Community initiative, establishing two new AI centers at the schools. The company says its Nvidia Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University for Robotics, Autonomy, and AI will provide students, faculty, and researchers with technologies related to robotics and autonomy, while the Nvidia Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will revolve around AI focused on health sciences. Nvidia has developed the most sought-after AI chips in the world, which has sent its stock price skyrocketing a staggering 934% over the last two years. To put that in perspective, and maybe generate some envy, if you invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2022, your stake would now be worth $103,400. But the company is facing increasing competition in the hardware space from longtime rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia’s own customers are also developing their own chips to power their AI software, which could cut into the company’s bottom line in the future. Nvidia’s endgame is to use software to hold on to its customers well into the future while providing recurring revenue streams. Highlighting its software also attracts developers to Nvidia’s offerings, and the more developers that build on Nvidia’s services, the more companies will seek out those platforms. Nvidia’s hardware lead isn’t going to disappear anytime soon, though. The company has been investing in AI technology for years, and it should continue to hold on to its competitive edge for some time. But by showing off its software, Nvidia is looking to prove it’s more than just a chip firm. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: One Wall Street Titan Thinks NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPU Production Volume Will Hit A Whopping 750K – 800K Units By Q1’25

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few weeks, the tech news airwaves have become literally choked with speculation surrounding the production cadence of NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, dubbed Blackwell. While NVIDIA had already laid a lot of consternation to rest during its recent earnings call, when it confirmed that the architecture's minor design flaws were rectified via specific changes to the photomask, the true scale of the company's oncoming production ramp-up is only now becoming visible, with Morgan Stanley expecting a 3x jump in the Blackwell production volume between Q4'24 and Q1'25. As our discerning readers would remember, Morgan Stanley had penned an important note on NVIDIA back in September, noting among other things that the company was on course to ship 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in ~$10 billion in revenue. At the time, the Wall Street titan had conceded that NVIDIA was still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, positing a qualifier that such issues were a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell revenue could surpass Hopper as soon as Q1 2025, says Morgan Stanley: "According to our checks of the GPU testing supply chain, Blackwell chip output should be around 250-300k in Q4 2024, contributing $5-10 billion revenue for NVIDIA, which is still… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 8, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh investment note on NVIDIA, where the bank leverages its channel checks to confirm its earlier prognostication of between $5 billion and $10 billion in Blackwell-derived revenue for Q4'24. However, this time around, Morgan Stanley moves a step further by expounding on its thoughts for NVIDIA's first quarter of the calendar year 2025. Specifically, the Wall Street behemoth believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes: "And into 1Q25, we understand that Blackwell chip volume may reach 750k-800k units, up almost 3x from 4Q24." The bank goes on to note: "Meanwhile, we expect Hopper volume (including H200 and H20) to be around 1500k units in 4Q24, and gradually ramp down to 1000k units in 1Q25." Critically, given the fact that the B200 chip is priced at a 60 to 70 percent premium to the H200 chip, Morgan Stanley expects NVIDIA's Blackwell-derived revenues to exceed those related to its Hopper architecture in Q1'25.

Clark on Tuesday launched a new venture, called Auger, which aims to help companies and governments combine the mishmash of "Franken-software" overseeing their supply chains into a single platform. "At Flexport, I got to see all of these companies in the middle, like the Nikes or Lululemons, and I was amazed at how much of a struggle it is, and how much they still use Excel or Smartsheet or Tableau or something to bring all this disparate data together in such a way that they can do something," Clark said in an interview. "A shocking amount of supply chain still runs on Excel." Clark's third act follows a short but tumultuous stint at Flexport. Last September, Clark abruptly resigned as CEO of Flexport, allowing for the return of its founder, Ryan Petersen. Petersen claimed repeatedly that Clark overspent and overhired during his time at the freight forwarding startup. But documents viewed by CNBC, and sources close to Clark, showed that Petersen and members of Flexport's board helped implement decisions that Flexport has suggested were ill-advised. Petersen has since taken steps to turn around the business by overhauling its top ranks, implementing layoffs and subleasing excess warehouse space. Before Flexport, Clark developed a storied reputation during his 23 years at Amazon as the architect of its mammoth logistics network. He joined Amazon's operations division in 1999 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the most important executives at the company. In 2020, Amazon tapped Clark to head its core retail business after longtime executive Jeff Wilke left the company. Clark departed Amazon for Flexport in 2022. Clark joined Flexport to bring what he had built at Amazon to "small businesses and other businesses around the world." He left the startup feeling there was still a gap in the market for supply chain tools, and began to develop the idea behind Auger. The name is meant to convey the drilling tool's ability to break through things and dive deep. "I spent the last year with the chance to really sort of step back and think about the best way to tackle this problem," Clark said. "What do I want to do next? Do I still want to try to tackle this problem? Do I want to do something else? And I just kept coming back to, this should not be a problem for companies with the technology that exists in the world." He said a typical company might have "eight to 10 to 12 to 20" systems for procurement, forecasting, and enterprise resource planning. The systems can be clunky and are rarely integrated. He wanted to build a platform where companies could manage their supply chain with the "same level of simplicity and intuitiveness as the consumer applications that they use every day." Clark, who moved with his family to Texas before leaving Amazon, has returned to his former employer's backyard in Seattle to work on the new venture, which will be based in Bellevue, Washington. He hopes to pull from the area's deep bench of tech talent. Amazon last year rolled out its own supply chain management platform, which can handle the process of transporting businesses' goods from the manufacturer to customers' doorsteps. But the service is targeted at businesses that sell on Amazon's marketplace and use its logistics and fulfillment network. Auger's launch comes as venture deal volume has steadily declined over the past few years, aside from investments in artificial intelligence companies. U.S. venture capital exit value this year is expected to reach $98 billion, down 86% from 2021, according to an Aug. 29 report from PitchBook, while venture-backed IPOs are expected to be at their lowest since 2016. VC activity in the supply chain tech industry has shown recent improvement, although it's well below the levels seen in 2021 and 2022. Global investment in the space hit $2.4 billion, marking the third straight quarter of growth, according to Pitchbook. Auger has raised $100 million from venture firm Oak HC/FT. Clark said he soon expects to grow headcount to about 20 employees and intends to launch a "V1" product within nine months.

In January, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chief Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote at Consumer Electronics Show 2025. The tech event will occur in Las Vegas from January 7-10, 2025. The event coincided with rumors of next-gen Nvidia GPUs appearing in 2025, the Verge reports. Nvidia could divulge an update about its RTX 50 series at CES, including its desktop GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture. Also Read: What’s Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Monday? Recently, Huang snubbed Wall Street concerns by indicating massive demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur flagged that the Blackwell GPU platform can support over 100 different system configurations, compared to the 19-20 options available with the prior generation Hopper GPU platform. According to Sur, Nvidia’s AI and accelerated compute moat will likely help it sustain growth into 2025 and beyond. Per the rumors, Nvidia may announce the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 simultaneously. At CES 2024, Nvidia showcased three new GPUs—the RTX 4060 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super for AI-ready laptops. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) voiced their conviction on AI personal computers (PCs) at the event, which contrasted with Nvidia’s focus on server-based AI. Nvidia stock is up over 182% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE:VTI). Price Action: NVDA stock is trading higher by 1.82% at $130.01 premarket at the last check on Tuesday.

Title: Florida's real-estate market is on edge amid back-to-back hurricanes

Time Published: 2024-10-08T12:29:29Z

Another hurricane is expected to hit Florida as the state continues recovering from Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Milton, a Category 4 storm (it weakened from a Category 5, but remains "extremely dangerous"), is on track to make landfall near Tampa Bay by Wednesday. It's the latest hurdle for the state's volatile real-estate market. Milton's peak wind speeds hit 160 mph on Monday. Heavy rain is expected before the storm arrives, and flooding is anticipated throughout the region. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued a state of emergency for 51 counties, and mandatory evacuations have begun in some areas. The mayor of Tampa, Jane Castor, has also issued a stark warning that anyone who remains in the city as Milton approaches will "die." It's never a good time for a hurricane to hit, but preparing for a powerful storm while you recover from another makes the situation even more challenging. Helene caused over 220 deaths and as much as $34 billion in damage, according to an estimate from Moody's Analytics. Meanwhile, federal agencies meant to provide emergency assistance, like FEMA and the Small Business Administration, face their own cash crises. Back-to-back hurricanes represent the latest problem for a real-estate market facing buyer's remorse. The threat and cost that hurricanes pose mean Florida homeowners have some reevaluating to do if they want to remain in the state, write Business Insider's Jordan Pandy, Dan Latu, and Madeline Berg. One homeowner told BI she pays $7,000 a year in flood and hazard insurance for her 1,400-square-foot bungalow just south of Tampa. (The policies paid off, her home was deemed uninhabitable after Helene, and she still wants to live there after it's repaired.) But those high costs, coupled with the annual fear of potentially losing your home every fall, have other residents throwing in the towel. Even a few insurers have called it quits on the state, while others could increase their prices by over 300% in the coming years. It's representative of the extremes the Sunshine State's real-estate market has faced in recent years. One of the pandemic's hottest markets, some people are now souring on Florida over its climate, costs, and overcrowding. (It's not alone in its post-pandemic comedown, as Texas is facing a similar fate.) But as much as people want to get out of the state, there will always be those looking to get in. More than 8,000 miles of coastline will do that. One Florida resident whose home sustained almost three feet of water damage from Helene cut their listing price by 40%. Within hours, their real-estate agent received 25 calls from investors interested in the property. Jump to

Title: This ‘Investing 101’ Advice Is A Mess When It Comes To Dividends

Time Published: 2024-10-08T12:05:00Z
Full Content:
The words "Investing 101" on a yellow legal pad Having a diversified portfolio is pretty much Investing 101, right? I mean, it’s one of the first things we all learn as investors. But there’s a problem here: Going for balance in “regular” stocks, bonds or ETFs can mean leaving income on the table. To see what I’m getting at here, check out the average yields on two ETFs many people buy for stock and bond exposure. For stocks, I likely don’t have to tell you about the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It’s the popular S&P 500 tracker. And it yields a microscopic 1.2%. There are plenty of options on the bond side, but let’s go with a fairly high-yielding ETF, the SPDR Bloomberg High-Yield Bond ETF (JNK). It holds the high-yield, or “junk,” bonds many investors (wrongly, as we’ll see in a moment) see as too risky. JNK yields 6.4%, which is obviously a lot better than 1.2%. But if you average the two together, you get just a 3.8% yield. Good news is, there’s an asset class out there that gives us the same level of diversification but with way more income: I’m talking 8%+ yields, with payouts often going out monthly. If you’ve been reading me for a while, or are a member of my CEF Insider service, you likely know where I’m heading next: to closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% on average as I write this. Below I’ve got three CEFs (one holding stocks, one holding high-yield bonds and one holding a nice stock-bond combo) that, when taken together, pay an average yield of 8.1%. Two of these funds pay dividends monthly, too. Let’s talk about them, starting with our equity CEF. As CEF Insider’s Investment Strategist, I’ve had plenty of occasions to speak to the staff at Adams Funds, sponsor of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). These conversations have always left me impressed. These people are professional, dedicated to shareholder value and committed to ensuring stable and reliable payouts. ADX, which yields 8.2% today, also gives us access to a level of institutional experience that’s very hard (if not impossible) to find elsewhere, inside or outside CEFs: The fund was launched in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. That’s nearly a century of dealing with anything the market can throw at it. As we’ll see in a moment, the result of that long experience has been market-beating performance. A long-time knock on ADX is that up until earlier this year, it paid most of its dividend in as a one-time, year-end special payout that fluctuated according to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). That caused some CEF investors to give ADX a pass in favor of monthly or quarterly paying funds. Management has now dealt with that issue: Under a change brought in earlier this year, ADX promises to pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That adds stability to the payout while still letting it ride with the value of the fund’s portfolio. So if you own SPY or one of its cousins now, consider swapping it out for ADX. You’ll get exposure to many of the same stocks, and ADX’s dividend policy means it essentially “converts” stock gains to dividends, giving you a solid income stream if you draw these funds off as cash. And if you reinvest your payouts, you get a real shot at beating the market. ADX has crushed SPY since we added it to the CEF Insider portfolio in July 2017: ADX Total Returns Now let’s talk discounts: As I write this, ADX trades at an 11.7% discount to NAV, meaning we get its portfolio of top-quality stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN), for around 88 cents on the dollar. ADX Discount NAV As you can see above, the discount narrowed to just below 7% earlier this year, on news of the new dividend policy. It has since fallen back, but as interest rates decline and investors go looking for higher yields, I expect them to flock back to ADX, drawn by its new dividend policy, its strong performance history and its high yield, too For bonds, let’s go with the Barings Global Short Duration High Yield Fund (BGH). BGH focuses on high-yield corporate bonds and yields 8.4%, while focusing on short-term bonds as a way to lower the risks of those bonds falling in value during a market panic, since they come to term so quickly. The fund’s payout is monthly and steady, having gone unchanged for years, with the odd special dividend (the spikes below), too: BGH Dividend That’s a much bigger dividend than JNK offers. And even though JNK does pay monthly, BGH’s payout is a picture of calm in comparison to JNK’s “squirrely” dividend: JNK Dividend By lending to large, established companies, BGH generates reliable cash flow. Limiting its investments to short-term bonds also lowers the risk of these investments going sour. And as you can see below, BGH’s discount is still wide, at around 6%, but it’s trending higher—a very nice setup. BGH Discount NAV I see this one trading at a premium as more income-seekers make their way to bonds as Treasuries yield less and CDs mature. Finally, a word on junk bonds and the risk of defaults, which is overblown. As we discussed in the September CEF Insider, American companies are far from struggling to meet their obligations, with fewer than 1% of issuers defaulting: Defaults Decline So don’t let the words “junk” or “high-yield” put you off—and cause you to miss out on BGH and its steady (and monthly paid) 8.4%-yielding dividend. The Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO) gives us exposure to top US large caps like Microsoft and Apple, much like ADX. But US stocks make up just 48% of the portfolio. The next-biggest slice (36%) goes to international equities like Nestle SA, pharmaceutical firm Sanofi and Compass Group PLC, a British food-service firm. The remainder (around 16%) is in fixed-income assets, mostly investment-grade bonds, to add a bit of extra stability. The whole package delivers a 7.8% dividend, paid monthly. And management recently raised it: ETO Dividend Trading at an 8.7% discount to NAV as I write this, BGH offers a smart blend of growth and income at a bargain price and, as with BGH, that discount is slowly disappearing. To cap it off, the fund has also delivered a strong annualized total return of 9.6% over the last decade, adding strong performance to our high, rising monthly payout and “stair-stepping” discount.

US stocks opened higher on Tuesday as investors welcomed a pullback in surging oil prices, putting focus back on the ongoing debate over the economy and interest rates. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) stepped up around 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also rose about 0.5% as tech megacaps began to recoup some of the previous session's losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%. Stocks are set to pick up on the winning trend of recent months as Monday's headwinds ease, with oil prices retreating as Mideast tensions cool somewhat. Some "Magnificent 7" stocks were starting to regain ground lost amid negative headlines, with Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) all nudging slightly higher. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) built on a closing gain as the chip heavyweight's partner Hon Hai pointed to "crazy" AI demand. But the market is still grappling with busted hopes for jumbo interest-rate cuts, while lingering recession worries got a boost as China failed to deliver expected big stimulus on Tuesday. Stocks in Hong Kong (^HSI) slumped over 9%, as a roaring stimulus-fueled rally in Chinese stocks fizzled out. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards On that theme, Federal Reserve policy is "well positioned" to nail a "soft landing" for the economy, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times. Meanwhile, Fed governor Adriana Kugler said data will continue to drive rate decisions. Those comments sharpened investors' focus on the CPI inflation report due Thursday, which will provide further clues on the path forward for interest rates. In corporates, PepsiCo (PEP) got the ball rolling on earnings season, posting a surprise drop in quarterly revenue and lowering its forecast for 2024 sales growth. Shares of the snack and drinks giant slipped in early trading. US stocks opened higher on Tuesday after all three major indexes closed Monday's session in the red. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each climbed around 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%. Oil prices, which have surged amid Middle East tensions, retreated early Tuesday. Crude oil (CL=F) fell about 3% to trade just below $75 a barrel. PepsiCo (PEP) lowered its sales outlook for the year, forecasting organic revenue growth in the low single digits below the previously expected 4% growth. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, PepsiCo's third-quarter revenue trailed behind Wall Street's estimates, coming in at $23.3 billion, versus the $23.8 billion expected. CEO Ramon Laguarta said in the release that Pepsi's performance was impacted by "subdued category performance trends in North America," the impact of recalls at Quaker Foods North America, and business disruptions from "rising geopolitical tensions in certain international markets." In a phone interview with Yahoo Finance, Laguarta said consumers are "very challenged" and they are making a "lot of trade-offs" when it comes to food. Those tradeoffs are weighing on the snacks business most acutely, Laguarta explained. PepsiCo shares dipped nearly 1% in pre-market trading. Read the full story here. Sign in to access your portfolio

PepsiCo (PEP) earnings come in below estimates and it cuts its full-year guidance; Honeywell (HON) will spin off its Advanced Materials division; a judge rules that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google must offer alternatives to its Play Store; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising after it overtakes Microsoft (MSFT) as the second-largest company by market capitalization; and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Big Deal Days kicks off as retailers look to grab consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season. Here's what investors need to know today. PepsiCo (PEP) shares are slipping about 1% in premarket trading after the soda giant reported third-quarter revenue of $23.32 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.13 that came in below expectations. "Given our performance to date and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver a low-single-digit increase in organic revenue (previously approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth)," PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ramon Laguarta said. PepsiCo's report comes after it warned about a weaker consumer in its prior-quarter report. Honeywell International (HON) will spin off its Advanced Materials division into a separate publicly traded company, the conglomerate said. According to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the plan, the division could be worth more than $10 billion as a separately traded public company. Shares of Honeywell were roughly 2% higher in premarket trading. A U.S. judge has issued a permanent injunction that will force Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play Store on Android phones. The ruling comes from video game maker Epic Games' successful antitrust suit, which found that Google maintained illegal monopoly power in operating its app store. After declining about 2.5% Monday, Alphabet shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) are gaining about 2% in premarket trading, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) in market capitalization to become the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares added 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, as its partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) reported strong shipments of its GPU processors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Amazon (AMZN) will hold its Prime Big Deal Days today and tomorrow as retailers attempt to draw in consumers looking to get an early start on holiday shopping. Concurrently, Walmart (WMT) is running its Holiday Deals event from today through Sunday, while Target (TGT) is holding its second Circle Week of the year through Saturday. Shares of Amazon are higher by less than 1% in premarket trading, while Walmart and Target are little changed.

As worldwide markets are challenged in an environment of higher interest rates, conflict in the Middle East, and the lingering battle between Russia and Ukraine, one thing has not changed: U.S. stocks are more expensive than global stocks. And with the large run-up in stock prices in late 2023 and the first half of 2024, U.S. stocks are even more expensive. Consider P/E ratios. The trailing P/E ratio on the S&P 500 is 28, above the global average of 14 and well above the 6-12 average P/Es for emerging markets stocks. A review of yields tells a similar story. The current dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 1.2%, versus the global average of 2.8% and Asian, Australian and Latin American yields of 3%-6%. The foreign region that does not completely fit the pattern is the Middle East. The average P/E on a Saudi Arabian stock is a relatively high 17. This can be attributed to high oil prices. Taking a step back, one reason investors generally are willing to pay a higher price for North American securities is the transparency of the U.S. financial system as well as the liquidity of U.S. markets. What's more, global returns can be volatile across individual countries, given GOOGL, HUM, NVDA, AVGO, ESYJY, EJTTF, HBI, ZTNO, INTC, ADBE, AMD, RGEN, AMZN, MRVL SMCI LEN, SMCI, CENT BABA, FBIN, LAZ, PTON, SMCI, K, SNAP, AAP, VFC, CAVA, IART, GEV, RKT, MRNA, PLTR LLY

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak. Here’s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them: Meta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how. Both stocks have outperformed the broader market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) – an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index. Valuations of both stocks have become expensive following the recent spike. The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant’s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector. The Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, “The profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.” Although there was a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October. Meta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta’s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September. The two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings. These include AI-driven chatbots, an updated Llama large-language model, the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved camera functionality, voice controls, and deeper integration with AI, Meta Quest 4, the next-generation virtual reality headset, and the Orion augmented reality glasses. The stock has been on a steady climb since then. Trending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. Further Upside? The average analysts’ price targets, compiled by TipRanks, suggest modest upside potential for Meta but downside for Palantir. Current Price 1-Year Average Analysts’ Price Target Upside/Downside Potential Meta $595.94 $608.20 +2.06% Palantir $40.01 $27.67 (-30.84%) The next big catalyst for Meta is likely to be the company’s third-quarter results due on Oct. 30, with the consensus modeling over 30% earnings per share growth and nearly 20% revenue growth. Meta’s fortunes to a large extent is tied to ad spending, which in turn hinges on macroeconomic conditions. With the Fed showing a proclivity to take rates down in the coming months, credit conditions could ease, potentially benefiting Meta. Palantir is a favorite among retail investors. Continuing deal flow, and strong third-quarter results and positive fourth-quarter guidance could keep the upward momentum intact. More importantly, the market has entered a seasonally strong quarter when a confluence of factors typically lifts the market. The stretched valuations, therefore, may not preclude further gains. That said, investors may remain wary of geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, with two wars ongoing and a hard-landing scenario still not off the table.

Title: Spotify’s HR chief says remote staff aren’t ‘children’ as company reaffirms work-from-anywhere policy

Amid a raft of return-to-office mandates from tech giants, including Amazon and iPhone challenger Nothing, Spotify sees no need to treat its staff like “children” and end its popular work-from-home policy. Spotify went through an overhaul last year, laying off 17% of its staff in December in a move CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged had a larger impact on operations than the company had anticipated. The decision has helped almost double Spotify’s market value this year, as the group notched record quarterly revenues while cutting costs. However, inside Spotify, the layoffs have shaken morale. For those who survived the cull, there isn’t likely to be a further morale-sapping plan to break with Spotify’s popular “work from anywhere” policy. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grownups and then treat them like children,” Spotify’s chief human resources officer Katarina Berg told Raconteur, explaining the group’s continued flexible work location policy. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom? “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” In February 2021, Spotify joined several other tech groups in allowing its employees to “work from anywhere.” This enabled employees to choose where and how they worked, provided the company had an office in that jurisdiction. Unlike other companies that have trickled employees back in on a hybrid basis, like Meta, or gone all-out and demanded a full return to the office, like Amazon, Spotify hasn’t chosen to renege on this policy. A big reason is likely the effect it has had on retention. Spotify said attrition rates were 15% lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2019. The company also said it had improved the diversity of its talent. While Spotify doesn’t intend to scrap its remote-working policy anytime soon, Berg acknowledged it wasn’t an ideal setup. “It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” Berg said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.” The company is still using innovative ways to encourage its music-loving staff to come into the office, including hosting “listening lounge” sessions featuring pop stars including Olivia Dean and Rag ‘n’ Bone Man. Staff are also strongly encouraged to come into the office during Spotify’s “core week” to reconnect and discuss strategy. Spotify’s biggest-ever round of layoffs last December, when it said goodbye to 1,500 staff, came as CEO Ek said the company was doing too much “work around the work.” The impact of those layoffs on operations was bigger than Ek expected, with Berg explaining to Raconteur that remaining staffers were left in a “state of shock” by the cull. “Spotify had been in hypergrowth, and this was the only thing people knew,” she said. “A lot of people at Spotify had never seen a recession, and it was a lot to absorb and digest.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: How Kamala Harris Is Creating a New Majoritarian Center
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/186863/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-majoritarian-center
Time Published: 2024-10-08T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Almost from the moment Joe Biden stepped aside in favor of Kamala Harris, the concern trolling commenced. “Harris’s biggest political liability is that she may be seen as too politically extreme,” fretted very serious journalist Josh Barro before advising the new Democratic nominee to “run to the center.” Former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Schoen concurred, confidently telling CNBC that “the key for her campaign is moving to the center.” To satisfy New York magazine political columnist Jonathan Chait, a mere “pivot” to the center would not be enough. Rather, he provocatively suggested, “Harris needs to adopt positions that will upset progressive activists.” Apparently, Harris’s nomination didn’t just unite the Democratic base. It also united a parade of pundits, politicos, and conventional wisdom–mongers of all stripes in urging her to unceremoniously betray the base by swerving to the center—especially on the economy—if she’s to have a fighting chance of defeating Donald Trump at the polls. Given the divisive state of American politics, that might not sound like such an unreasonable take. But glaringly absent from this allegedly centrist consensus is a working definition of what or where the political and economic “center” actually is. And spoiler alert: On most issues, the center is arguably somewhere in the vicinity of Kamala Harris. Especially on the economy. To understand why, we need to think a little bit about what would comprise a truly “centrist economics.” But before we do that, we need to define our terms. The whole left-right dichotomy dates back to the early days of the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly who favored a more revolutionary path (that is, a republic) took to sitting to the left, while those defending the ancien régime (the monarchists) gathered together on the right. Today, we universally put conservatives on the right and progressives on the left. Policies that favor the rich go on the right, policies that favor working people go on the left. An economic ideology that advocates unfettered free market capitalism definitely goes on the right, while a Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat is the sine qua non of far left. Most people still have a shared intuition about what the political labels “left” and “right” mean, particularly in regard to how competing policy proposals relate to one another. But the “center”? Not so much. For example, most people would instantly agree that a proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would fall on the left or even far-left side of the spectrum. After all, it’s more than double! Yet ask people to pick an ideologically “centrist” minimum wage rate and this remarkable consensus instantly falls apart. Self-described centrists often pride themselves on reaching across the aisle to negotiate bipartisan compromise. But ideological centrism can’t be as simple as just splitting the difference—in fact, on many noneconomic issues, difference-splitting would be facially absurd. For example, how do we split the difference on marriage equality, or on the peaceful transfer of power? How would we split the difference on Trump’s plan for the “bloody” deportation of 20 million people? Would a centrist alternative be just 10 million deportations, and with precisely half as much blood? And even on economic issues that can be easily quantified in dollars, difference-splitting can make little sense. Splitting the difference between $15 and $0—that’s the essence of the Project 2025 proposal, which would allow states to opt out of enforcing a minimum wage at all—would set the federal minimum wage at just 25 cents more than the current $7.25-an-hour rate that has been relentlessly eroded away by inflation for the 15 years that have passed since the last increase in the federal minimum wage. That’s not centrism. That’s defending the status quo, a quintessentially conservative instinct that has long been associated with the political right. The truth is, there is no inherently centrist ideology. According to an analysis by 538, the large plurality of voters who self-identify as moderate are in fact “all over the ideological map.” That’s why if you ask the average person to describe an ideologically centrist policy position, they usually default to the position they already hold. And in fact, that’s exactly what Barro and Schoen and Chait and others have done in assuming that Harris’s positions are “too politically extreme.” The center to them is where they currently stand—smack dab in the middle of the old neoliberal consensus that had long dominated both parties before Biden abandoned it in favor of an agenda that grows the economy “from the middle out.” And it’s that neoliberal center they want Harris to reclaim. Neoliberalism argues that markets are inherently efficient, rational, and meritocratic, and that the fastest path toward achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people is to simply get out of the market’s way. Over the nearly half-century during which neoliberalism held sway, the ideologically centrist agenda was dominated by tax cuts for the rich, deregulation of the powerful, and wage suppression for everyone else. The result was decades of rising and radical inequality that have undermined faith in both democracy and markets. And if this sort of centrism is your measuring stick, then yes, the Harris agenda might look a little extreme. But there are in fact two kinds of political centers: There’s the ideological center—the one that neoliberals have long occupied. And there’s the majoritarian center—the one where most of the people are. Harris’s critics are half correct. If Democrats hope to be a majority party, they need to embrace the center. But it’s the majoritarian center, not the ideological one, that matters most in November. As I argued in Politico Magazine back in 2018, to understand the difference between these two strains of economic centrism, it’s important to understand exactly what the center is measuring. Imagine lining up every person in America on a yardstick, with the poorest person standing to the far-left edge of the stick (zero inches) and the wealthiest person standing to the far right (36 inches). Assuming that people are equally spaced, and that there is no correlation between wealth and weight—if you could balance that yardstick on the tip of your finger—the fulcrum would fall on the 18-inch mark, the exact center of the yardstick, with exactly half of all Americans standing to the left, and the other half standing to the right. Clustered on and near that 18-inch mark are the median American families—the middle-middle class: the majoritarian center of the American electorate, at least from an economic perspective. Now imagine that very same yardstick with every American standing in their very same spots—only this time, rather than balancing people, we are balancing their personal wealth, stacked up in $100 bills. But because 2 percent of Americans (of which I am one) own 50 percent of the nation’s wealth, to balance this yardstick you’d now have to slide your finger nearly all the way over, beyond the 35-inch mark, just inside the far-right edge. This fulcrum balances the interests of capital versus the interests of working people. And unfortunately, this is the yardstick that represents the reality of political and economic power distribution in the United States. It’s the yardstick of the neoliberal center—a centrism informed by the bad economic theories that guided the policies of both parties for more than 40 years. This precarious balancing act helps explain why policies that would clearly benefit the majoritarian center are so often rejected as ideologically “far left”; for an ideological centrism that seeks to balance the interests of capital is a centrism that seeks to protect the interests of the very wealthiest Americans against those of everybody else. By contrast, a majoritarian centrism focuses its policies more on outcomes than on ideology. For example, consider again the $15 minimum wage, a policy our intuition suggests leans ideologically to the left. At $7.25 an hour, the current federal minimum wage provides a floor under only 1.1 percent of all wage and salary workers—a cohort one might fairly characterize as occupying the far left of our economic yardstick. By comparison, a hike to $15 an hour would directly or indirectly benefit 29.2 percent of workers. And with half of all American jobs paying less than $23.11 an hour, a $20 minimum wage (almost exactly what the minimum wage would be today had it been raised to $15 and indexed to inflation back when that idea was first proposed in 2012) would directly cover a large plurality of workers, while indirectly pushing wages higher for many millions more as employers raise wages further up the pay scale in order to maintain differentiation relative to the minimum. From a majoritarian perspective—a perspective that asks, “Who benefits?”—the higher you raise the minimum wage, the more centrist the policy becomes! (For those neoliberals still insisting the minimum wage would hurt workers by destroying jobs, a recent meta-analysis of 88 minimum wage studies concluded that estimates published since 2010 found near zero offset from earnings due to lost jobs.) Further bolstering its centrist credentials, raising the minimum wage turns out to be extraordinarily popular across all partisan identifications. Eighty-five percent of likely voters would support a $9 minimum wage, 83 percent a $12 minimum wage, and 64 percent a $17 minimum wage. Even Republicans are largely on board. It’s hard to find another economic issue with greater majoritarian support. And the minimum wage is just one of many intuitively left- (and sometimes right-) leaning proposals that pass the following two-part majoritarian centrist test: 1. Is the policy broadly beneficial? A policy that directly benefits a majority of Americans clearly passes this part of the test, but so might a policy that benefits a large plurality, especially if the beneficiaries are clustered around the middle. 2. Is the policy broadly popular? Obviously, policies that enjoy majority support are clearly popular, and most of the elements of the Biden-Harris economic agenda pass this test. Even Harris’s pledge to go after price gouging, widely derided by economists, is popular. But in addition, given a deeply divided electorate, a policy should not necessarily require an absolute majority in order to pass this test. For example, a policy that receives just 40 percent support but with only 20 percent opposed may in fact be more majoritarian and certainly less divisive than a policy that enjoys a slim 50.1 percent majority support to 49.9 percent opposed. A policy that is both broadly beneficial and broadly popular is properly located within the majoritarian center. And by this measure, the bulk of Harris’s economic agenda is inarguably centrist regardless of how ideologically left or right we might at first intuit it to be. In fact, if you step through Harris’s 82-page economic plan and evaluate it from the left, right, and center (I’m looking at you, Josh Barro), I challenge you to conclude that any of her proposals are “politically extreme” either by ideological or majoritarian standards. Among Harris’s signature proposals is to cut taxes on more than 100 million working- and middle-class families through restoring and enhancing the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, with the costs paid for by increasing the tax on stock buybacks, enacting a billionaire’s tax, and raising the capital gains tax rate for those earning more than a million dollars a year. All of these proposals score as both broadly popular and (unless you’re a recalcitrant trickle-downer) broadly beneficial, so they are majoritarian centrist to their core. But instructively, they also highlight how useless our ideological intuitions can sometimes be. The EITC, for example, has long been an essential thread in our social safety net, lifting millions of families out of poverty by supplementing low-wage pay. So it sure feels like it leans to the left. And yet … first proposed by Richard Nixon and signed into law by Gerald Ford, the EITC is essentially a variation on Milton Friedman’s negative income tax—about as economically right a pedigree as a policy could have. Furthermore, in practice, this tax credit is as much a subsidy to low-wage employers as it is to low-wage workers, helping to perpetuate an exploitive business model that increases profits at the expense of the working poor. And this isn’t the only Harris proposal that challenges standard categories. On housing, Harris proposes working with public, private, and not-for-profit developers to build an additional three million affordable housing units over the course of her first term, while “cut[ting] red tape” (i.e., deregulation) and imposing new regulations on corporate property owners who drive up prices by hoarding supply or by colluding on rents. In addition, she proposes to help first-time homebuyers with up to $25,000 toward a down payment. Because this ideologically nuanced fusion of regulation, deregulation, public investment, and market incentives would benefit millions, it clearly serves the interests of the majoritarian center. And while neoliberal critics might dismiss any role for government in directing the housing industry as too far left, there remains “strong bipartisan support for federal action” on housing affordability. The same is true of Harris’s pledge to “build” on the progress made through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan, as well as to continue the Biden administration’s practices in favor of organized labor and against unfair trade. This embrace of industrial policy—of (gasp) state planning—might reasonably be intuited as ideologically left. Yet many of the policies required to implement it (for example, hundreds of billions of dollars of grants and loans to giant corporations) arguably lean to the right. So which is it? Republican Senator Marco Rubio makes a compelling case that industrial policy, properly done, is inherently neither left nor right, and I totally agree. That said, the policy objectives are all broadly progressive, broadly popular, and if properly done, broadly beneficial. The rest of Harris’s agenda is easier on our ideological intuition. Her proposal to increase the startup expense tax deduction for new businesses from $5,000 to $50,000 arguably leans right, while nearly everything else is at least moderately progressive. But they are all majoritarian. Protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing quality affordable childcare, long term care, and education, tackling the climate crisis and lowering energy costs by investing in clean energy, lowering drug prices by taking on Big Pharma, and “expanding and strengthening the Affordable Care Act” (as opposed to Trump’s “concepts of a plan” to repeal and replace it)—they all pass the test. Quibble with the details of my analysis all you want, but there is arguably nothing in Harris’s economic plan that is ideologically “extreme,” and while taken as a whole her agenda is clearly progressive, it is also more fiscally conservative than what her opponent has proposed. Don’t take my word for it: The Penn Wharton Budget Model—a paragon of neoliberal orthodoxy—finds that Harris’s tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. By comparison, the Trump proposals? $5.8 trillion! From a budget hawk perspective, it’s the Trump economic agenda that is extreme. Of course, the obvious question, the one that is always hurled at Democrats who propose good things, is “How are you going to pay for it?” And the answer is that policies that grow the middle class pay for themselves. Not in the first year, maybe not over 10 years, but certainly in the long run, because, as Harris recently explained in a speech to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the middle class is “the growth engine of our economy.” This is the “middle-out economics” that clearly infuses Harris’s economic agenda—an economics informed by decades of empirical research and the latest advances in the fields of complex systems theory, evolutionary theory, physics, behavioral psychology, and other disciplines. And while middle-out still has far to go before achieving the same ideological devotion as neoliberalism, it has already proven far more capable at connecting cause with effect. For example, the Democratic policy agenda has always been more middle-out than the Republicans’, even during the neoliberal era, which helps explain why, by every standard economic metric—including gross domestic product growth, job growth, wage growth, investment growth, the S&P 500, and yes, even inflation—on average, the economy has performed better under Democratic administrations than under Republicans. It’s doubtful that most Democratic elected officials understood that their more inclusive agenda was also more pro-growth, but if they did, they lacked the confidence to run on such an unorthodox claim. The emerging new middle-out consensus finally offers an empirical and theoretical foundation to back it up. What we are seeing in the policies of Biden and Harris and in their rejection of neoliberal orthodoxy is the coalescing of a truly centrist economics that, in Harris’s words, is not “constrained by ideology.” If many of these policies appear to lean to the ideological left, it is merely out of “pragmatic” consideration for how modern market economies work best, and for the indispensable role of government in assuring that they work for everybody. “What makes an economic policy distinctively centrist,” wrote the political scientist Damon Linker in 2019, “is its capacity to speak to the concerns of the broadest possible slice of the electorate—while remaining at all times keenly aware of the main points of fracture in contemporary public opinion.” The key, wrote Linker, “is to follow public opinion wherever it leads,” even when it diverges from that of the neoliberal elites of both parties. “If this centrist agenda sounds like something many progressives would applaud or at least view as a good start, that’s because the new center takes its economic cues from the left side of the traditional spectrum.” When members of the old guard pitch Biden’s exit as an “opportunity” for Democrats to reclaim the center, what they’re really pitching is an opportunity for the neoliberal ancien régime to reclaim the Democratic Party for themselves. But Harris can’t move to the center, because she’s already there. It’s just a different center than the one we’ve been taught to think about. It’s her neoliberal critics who are extreme.

Netflix (NFLX) reports third-quarter earnings next Thursday, Oct. 17, and analysts expect the streaming giant to post year-over-year revenue, profit, and subscriber growth ahead of the final quarter of 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project that Netflix will report net income of $2.23 billion on revenue of $9.77 billion, up 33% and 14%, respectively, from a year earlier. Shares have gained nearly 45% since the start of the year, but they dipped following the company's quarterly reports in April and July. Analysts expect Netflix to report just under 286 million active subscribers at the end of the quarter, up about 4 million from last quarter and over 30 million more than last year, according to Visible Alpha. Netflix has said it will stop reporting subscriber data starting in 2025, and focus instead on financial metrics. Analysts have said Netflix's crackdown on password sharing has been successful in driving new subscribers. Barclays analysts, however, recently cited the "trade-offs" suggested by its pathways to future growth in downgrading the stock to "underweight" from "equal weight"—making them the only analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with a "sell"-equivalent rating—while leaving unchanged a price target of $550. Netflix has an important fourth quarter, with KeyBanc analysts recently noting that the streamer's first NFL games, which will be broadcast on Christmas Day, could be a catalyst for subscriber growth. The analysts, who raised their price target to $760 from $735, said nearly a quarter of people they surveyed who aren't Netflix subscribers said the games would make them consider signing up. The Christmas games are the latest bet on live sports from Netflix and other streamers as a way to draw new subscribers. Netflix is also set to become the official broadcaster of TKO Group's (TKO) WWE professional wrestling events starting next year.

Title: Nvidia: What are investors are asking?

Investing.com -- Analysts at Citi have been on the road marketing in Boston and Europe, where they discussed with investors key topics regarding the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. According to the Wall Street firm, the company's AI adoption “remains in 3rd/4th innings as enterprise AI demand takes off next with AI agents.” Analysts expect Nvidia stock to remain range-bound through the CES event in early 2025 before new product launches, such as Blackwell GPUs, drive a sales and margin inflection. Citi notes that a recurring investor concern is Nvidia's gross margin trajectory. The bank predicts that gross margins will bottom out at around 72% in the January quarter, stabilizing in the mid-70s once the Blackwell series ramps up. Another focal point for investors is the competition between Nvidia’s GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). While ASICs can be advantageous for fixed-function applications, Nvidia GPUs offer versatility. As AI models expand, Nvidia's GPUs, which are capable of handling various applications, will likely see continued demand, analysts said. Moreover, enterprises favor multi-cloud strategies, and GPUs allow applications to run across different cloud platforms without rewriting. Citi also highlights that data center operators prioritize the total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI), areas where Nvidia continues to lead due to its ability to run diverse applications, including AI. “As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases,” analysts said in a Monday note. At the same time, investors are also keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s vertical integration strategy, which has progressed from chips to entire systems, a response to the slowdown of Moore’s Law. As for the Blackwell sales mix, the shift towards the GB200 format from the B100’s 8-GPU format is also expected to optimize TCO and ROI, Citi’s note states. Looking ahead, investors are optimistic about the long-term ROI, particularly with Nvidia’s emphasis on AI across large markets like social media and e-commerce. However, patience will be required as generative AI matures into disruptive business models. “We expect to see positive ROI data points next year led by GPU-as-a-service providers,” analysts said. With a Buy rating and a price target of $150, Citi remains bullish on Nvidia, with potential risks stemming from competition in gaming and possible market volatility in the auto and data center segments.

Nvidia's (NVDA) market capitalization overtook Microsoft's (MSFT) on Monday, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares climbed just over 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, ahead of Microsoft's $3.04 trillion. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a partner of Nvidia, reported strong shipments of its GPUs driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, helping send shares of both companies higher. Nvidia and Microsoft have been jockeying with Apple for the top spot by market cap in recent months. In June, Nvidia briefly took the crown when it surpassed Microsoft, but Microsoft later reclaimed the title, and Apple has since pulled ahead. Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, as demand for its AI chips surged. Analysts suggested Nvidia shares could still climb higher, given the strength of AI spending trends and seasonal tailwinds. Semiconductor companies typically perform better in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter, with Nvidia “still set to lead," Melius Research analysts said Monday, adding "the setup here is still pretty darn good." Melius holds a price target of $165 for Nvidia, a 29% premium on Monday's closing price of $127.72. That compares to an average price target of $152.52, according to Visible Alpha.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will hold its "Advancing AI" event this week, with analysts expecting new product announcements that could drive the stock higher and lift sales. AMD shares are more than 15% above where they started the year, though off the record levels set in March. Thirteen analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on AMD stock, while three have a "hold" rating. AMD stock has an average target price of $190.56, meaning analysts broadly expect AMD shares will rise a further 11%. AMD closed Monday at just under $171 after changing only slightly tostart the week. The company's shares rose nearly 20% in the days following a similar event last December. Analysts have said they expect AMD to announce new products at the Thursday event, which could pave the way for it to gain market share in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator space as it faces off against Nvidia (NVDA), the industry leader. Analysts said the "AI ecosystems partners, customers and developers" that AMD mentioned in the event's announcement could include new customers—evidence of AMD's growing market share.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Citi has penned an important investment note on NVIDIA today, touching on the stock's immediate prospects and the likely trajectory of the GPU manufacturer's margins as the Blackwell production ramp-up gets underway. Off the bat, Citi has asserted that NVIDIA's under-pressure gross margins will bottom out in the low-70s percents in Q1 2025, with the Wall Street titan continuing to view the ~72 percent level as the likely trough. After Q1, Citi expects NVIDIA's gross margins to stabilize in "the mid-70s%" as the Blackwell architecture ramps up. The bank notes: "While we are bullish on another strong +40% Y/Y cloud data center capex growth next year, we expect the stock to likely remain range bound through CES Jan before Blackwell driven Y/Y sales and gross margin inflection in the Apr-Q." On the topic of the GPU competition that is rapidly heating up, Citi perceives no immediate threat as NVIDIA's products currently lead the market on multiple metrics, including the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and the Return on Investment (ROI). The bank believes data centers prefer NVIDIA's GPUs for the flexibility that they offer: "As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases." According to the bank, an enterprise operating across multiple cloud-based platforms has to re-write its applications specific to every cloud operator, which poses a huge pain point. In contrast, "with NVDA GPUs, enterprises write their applications once as it will be transferable across clouds." What's more, NVIDIA's large installed base already constitutes a strong pull for developers, who desire "the largest possible adoption of their applications." On the topic of the Blackwell sales mix, Citi asserts that the GB200 chip will attract a greater proportion of orders from customers instead of the "B100’s 8-GPU format," owing to the former's favorable TCO and ROI metrics. In light of its positive - if a bit dampened - view on NVIDIA, Citi has maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a target of $150 per share.

Title: Humana Stock Is at Multiyear Lows as Investors Digest Its Medicare Rating

Time Published: 2024-10-07T19:22:52Z
Full Content:
Humana (HUM) shares slid after Jefferies downgraded the insurer's stock, pointing to the negative impacts of the company's latest ratings for its Medicare offerings. Humana stock plunged last week after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said the quality rating of one of its plans, which accounts for nearly half of its Medicare Advantage (MA) memberships, fell to 3.5 stars down from 4.5 stars last year. Higher star ratings generate bonus payments for the insurers that offer plans that earn them. Today the shares, down nearly 2%, are trading at lows not seen since the early days of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Jefferies, meanwhile, cut its rating on Humana to “hold” from “buy,” and slashed its price target from $419 to $253, well off Wall Street's consensus around $327 according to Visible Alpha data. The analysts said that although Humana is suing the CMS, calling its star ratings process flawed—and noting that United Health Group (UNH) and Elevance Health (ELV) both filed successful appeals last year—they are continuing to move forward as if Humana would not win its appeal against CMS. Shares of Humana have sunk since the CMS rating came out last week, adding to a slump that began in January when the company first warned that higher medical costs and government regulations would hurt profits.

Title: Nvidia Eclipses Microsoft As World’s Second-Largest Company As Stock Climbs To 6-Week High

Nvidia stock rallied Monday despite a broader down day on Wall Street for its big technology peers, boosting the artificial intelligence heavyweight to reclaim its spot as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia's centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang speaks last month at a Washington, D.C., conference. Nvidia notched its highest intraday share price since Aug. 26 at $130.64, with shares up about 4.2% by mid-afternoon. The Silicon Valley firm accordingly registered its highest market capitalization since August, and its $3.19 trillion market value sent it past Microsoft ($3.07 trillion) as the world’s second-largest company for the first time in six weeks; Nvidia now only trails Apple’s $3.4 trillion valuation. Nvidia stock’s strong start to the week came despite broader losses, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% as higher bond yields and oil prices ate into the equity boost from shifting U.S. monetary policy. Shares of all five trillion-dollar tech companies other than Nvidia fell Monday, with Apple down 1.3%, Microsoft 0.7%, Google parent Alphabet 1.4%, Amazon 2.8% and Facebook parent Meta 0.9%. Nvidia, which designs a full suite of custom AI technology intended for high-end applications like large-language models, benefitted Monday from fellow AI tech maker Super Micro Computer’s announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products deployed alongside Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) was strong this quarter. Another bullish analyst note also boosted shares, as Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote to clients the “setup here is still pretty darn good” for Nvidia stock even as it enjoys an extended bounce. “Strong AI spending” from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet and ChatGPT parent OpenAI should “catalyze consumption” of Nvidia’s core (GPUs), according to Reitzes. The demand optimism follows continued comments from Nvidia’s centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang insisting demand for its AI products is “so great” and “insane.” Monday is a continuation of a month-long period of outsized returns for Nvidia, as its 26% return since Sept. 6 trounces the S&P’s 6% gain during the period and its five trillion-dollar peers’ 7% average gain. Nvidia was briefly the world’s largest company in June, when its share price peaked at a still-record $140.76. Previously a fairly low-profile company known for its video game business, Nvidia became a Wall Street darling as its profits skyrocketed amid the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s valuation has increased tenfold over the past two years. $21.9 billion. That’s how much in adjusted profits Nvidia is expected to report in its fiscal quarter ending this month, according to average analyst forecasts tracked by FactSet. That’s a more than 80% year-over-year increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and a more than 1,000% jump from 2022’s comparable period. One Community.

Some employees have already voiced their opposition to the RTO mandate, with some saying they have no intention of complying, often because they were hired during the pandemic, assured remote work would continue, and live outside commuting range of any corporate office. It’s unclear at this time if Amazon will primarily target these individuals, or if the layoffs will have a wider scope.

Title: EM Currencies Fall for Fifth Day as Traders Temper Fed Bets

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market currencies declined for a fifth consecutive session on Monday as traders scaled back bets on another big interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve amid signs of a resilient US economy. The MSCI Inc. gauge for developing-nation currencies was down 0.3% as of 12:10 p.m. in New York, posting its longest streak of losses since July. The Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah were among the worst performers in a basket of currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Oil prices rose as investors remain nervous about increased tensions in the Middle East. Traders have been rethinking the path for the Fed’s policy easing since the release of stronger-than-expected US jobs data on Friday. US Treasury 10-year yields rose to hover the 4% level as traders pared wagers on another half-point cut by the US central bank. “The repricing of the US easing cycle is likely to keep EMFX under pressure in the short term,” said Luis Estrada, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Bearish bets on the US dollar are being dismantled, while some investors are also buying dollars to hedge their constructive wagers on EM rates, he said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists cut their recommendation on EM local-currency debt last week, citing the “big upside surprise” in payrolls and risks stemming from the US presidential election in about a month. That comes after EM local bonds posted their biggest quarterly advance since 2020. The benchmark for emerging-market equities rose for a second day, mostly driven by gains in shares of Asian semiconductor companies. A subindex for Latin America stocks retreated. Optimism about stimulus measures has sparked a massive rally in Chinese stocks. Exchange-traded funds that buy the nation’s equities have seen billions of dollars in inflows. China’s top economic planner will hold a press briefing on Tuesday to discuss a package of policies aimed at boosting economic growth. Details on potential fiscal policy stimulus will be key in determining whether the momentum of the current rally can continue or whether the relief might be only temporary, according to Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. “In the short term, EM ex-China stocks may continue to underperform China due to rotational shifts in capital flows,” Dinic said. In credit markets, El Salvador’s notes jumped after the government launched a tender offer for several debt instruments. Bonds maturing in 2050 rose as much as 2.8 cents on the dollar, according to indicative pricing collected by Bloomberg. Ghana bonds also rose after the nation received “overwhelming” backing of bondholders to restructure $13 billion of eurobonds. --With assistance from Srinivasan Sivabalan.

Title: Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu isn’t thinking too far ahead

By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. Today, I’m talking with Jesse Lyu, the founder and CEO of Rabbit. The startup company makes the adorable r1 AI gadget — a little handheld designed by superstar design firm Teenage Engineering. It’s meant to be how you talk to an AI agent, which then goes off onto the internet and does things for you, from playing music on Spotify and ordering an Uber to even buying things on Amazon. Rabbit launched with a lot of hype at CES and a big party in New York, but early reviews of the device were universally bad. Our own David Pierce gave it a 3 out of 10 in May, saying that most of the features don’t work or don’t even exist. And the core feature that didn’t seem to exist was the most important of all: Rabbit’s large action model, or LAM, which is meant to allow the system to open a web browser in the cloud and browse for you. The LAM is supposed to intelligently understand what it’s looking at on a website and literally click around to accomplish tasks on your behalf. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! There have been a lot of questions about just how real Rabbit’s LAM was, but the company finally launched what it calls the LAM Playground, which lets people use a bare-bones version of the system. It does indeed appear to be clicking around on the web, although it is very slow. So, I wanted to know how Jesse planned to invest in the LAM and compete with other AI agents that promise to do things for you. For example, Microsoft just announced a new agent-y version of Copilot, and Apple’s vision for the next generation of Siri is an AI agent — and it’ll run on your phone and have direct access to those apps and your data inside them. It’s the same with Google and Gemini and Amazon’s rumored next generation of Alexa. This is major competition for a startup, and Jesse talked about wanting to get out ahead of it. But really, I wanted to know how Rabbit’s system works and whether it’s durable — not just technically, which is challenging, but also from a business and legal perspective. After all, if Rabbit’s idea works and the LAM really does go and browse websites for you… what’s stopping companies like Spotify and DoorDash from blocking it? You might have a strong point of view here — Jesse certainly does — but at some point, there’s going to be a fight about this, and it’s not clear what’s going to happen. To put this in historical context, about a decade ago, a handful of startups tried to stream broadcast television without licenses by putting a bunch of antennas in a single location and building apps that let people access them. This felt technically legal — what’s the difference between all those people having their own antennas and putting all those antennas in a single place and those accessing them over the internet? Some of these companies were seriously innovative — the most famous was a company called Aereo, which spent a ton of money designing specialized TV antennas the size of a nickel so it could pack as many of them into a data center as possible. I wrote about Aereo back then — visited the antenna floor, interviewed the CEO, the whole thing. Aereo then got sued by the TV networks, the case went to the Supreme Court in 2014, and you will note that Aereo no longer exists. I don’t know if Rabbit is another Aereo, and I don’t know how all these companies will react to having robots browse their websites instead of people. And I certainly don’t know how legal systems around the world will handle the inevitable lawsuits to come. I asked Jesse about all of this, and you’ll hear his answer: he thinks Rabbit will be so successful that these companies will want to show up and make deals. I have to say, I don’t know about that, either. I do know that this is a pretty intense and occasionally contentious interview. Jesse didn’t back down, and that means we got pretty deep into it. Let me know what you think. Okay, Jesse Lyu, founder and CEO of Rabbit. Here we go. The following transcript was edited for clarity. Jesse Lyu, you’re the founder and CEO of Rabbit. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. Glad to be here. I’m very excited to talk to you. Rabbit is a fascinating company. The idea for the r1 product is fascinating. I think a lot of people think that something that looks like the r1 is the next evolution of smartphones or products or something. And then there’s the company itself, which is really interesting, and you’ve got a connection to Teenage Engineering, which is one of our favorite companies here at The Verge. So, just a lot to talk about. And you’ve got some news to share about opening up Rabbit’s Large Action Model so people can play with it, and it’s kind of an early version. I really want to talk about that. But let’s start with Rabbit itself. The company has not been around that long. The r1 just started shipping six months ago. What is Rabbit? How’d the company start? Long story short, it’s a very young company. So here’s a little bit of history of it. I actually started a AI company back in 2013, which was called Raven Tech, and we were at YC Winter ‘15 batch. And it’s basically my personal dream to chase this grand vision that, I guess, me being this generation, growing up, we watched so many sci-fi movies, there’s AI stuff here and there. And I guess every geek wants to build their own Jarvis at some point. So I think that’s exactly how I started Raven Tech 11, 12 years ago. And back then, we had this idea, we had this direction, but the technology back then — obviously, there wasn’t like GPU training, there weren’t transformers and stuff. So we worked really hard on the early days of voice dictation and NLP and NLU, which is natural language processing and natural language understanding. So the technology wasn’t there, but we tried our best. We actually built and entire cloud system and the hardware, which is similar to what we have in Rabbit today. But the form factor was more of a smart speaker — as we all know back 10 years ago, everyone was chasing that form factor. Ultimately, the company got acquired, so it’s not a new idea for myself, but it’s definitely a new opportunity that when I saw the progress on the research side, the transformer, obviously, [when] I got a chance to try ChatGPT, or GPT’s API. We were really impressed because we felt the timing is right. Because being able to do something like r1 or more sci-fi, Jarvis stuff, you really need to figure out two parts from the back end. One is that you want to make sure that by talking to the device, the computer or device actually understand what you’re talking about, which is the transformer, the large language model part. But we believe at around 2020, 2021, we believe that the transformer is absolutely the right path that opening, other companies are heading to. We believe that portion has been solved, will be solved. So our focus immediately shifted to: after this device can understand you, can it actually help you do things? And the company that I started 10, 11 years ago, Raven Tech, we were actually one of the first company that designed a cloud API structure. After the [voice] recognition, after the understanding, the query got sent into different APIs. The system has a detector to understand, “Oh, maybe you are looking for a restaurant on Yelp. Maybe you want to play a song from this streaming software.” But I guess 10 years ago, there’s a great opportunity of APIs. There are a lot of company working on APIs. And if you remember 10 years ago in Silicon Valley, everyone was talking about maybe in the future the entire operating system will be just HTML5. Right? But that didn’t live quite long. I think now when we’re looking after 2020, the API business is not really major business for most of the popular services. So we also want to take an evaluation of whether we can build a generic piece of agent technology, which is really hard. Because I believe the current AI is all generic. Obviously, there’s a lot of people doing vertical stuff. Right? You can build an agent for Excel. You can build an agent for legal documentation process. But I think the biggest dream, what’s really make us excited is the generic part of it. It’s like, can we build something that without pre-training, without knowing people want to do what, and they just talk whatever they want, and we’ll be able to smart enough to handle all the tasks. So that’s why we felt the opportunity was right, and we started Rabbit right after COVID. The idea that agents are going to be a big part of our life, and in particular general purpose agents that go take actions for us on the internet — I’ve heard this idea from all kinds of folks, from startup founders like yourself to the CEOs of the biggest companies in the world. I want to come back to that. That’s a big idea, but I just want to stay focused on Rabbit for a second. How many people work at Rabbit today? I believe at the current moment, we’re roughly around 50 people, 50 to 60 people if we plus the interns. But when we started, the company was seven, and by the time we launched as CES it was 17. So just by growing the team within four or five months, it was quite a challenging job for me. So CES was the big launch. We were there, David Pierce was at the party. The Rabbit was introduced. You gave demos in a hotel room, I think. And then you had the launch party here at the TWA Hotel at JFK, which is very cool. The thing’s been out, but you’ve been growing. You said you started at 17 people in January at CES, and you have 50 now. What are you adding all those people to do? Most of it’s just engineers. We have a very small group of design, hardware design or ID that we started from day one, and most of the new folks are working on AI and infrastructure perspective, like cloud basically. We not only ship the hardware. We build the entire Rabbit OS for it. So I think the major work is always going to be in the software part. How is the whole company structured? As you go from seven to 17 to 50, you obviously have to decide how to structure Rabbit. How is that structured now? How has it changed? We are primarily located in Santa Monica. We have a device team of really great folks in the Bay Area, and we have a couple of research engineers here and there. So it’s kind of mostly in person, but a somewhat hybrid system. And the way that we find our people is mostly by internal referring. So we’re not spending money chasing for agents, agencies to do the hiring. Most of the good folks, we basically do internal recommendation. But your 50 people that you have now, how is that organized inside the company? It’s really flat in a sense. We have different departments, obviously. The hardware ODM/OEM part is in Asia. We have our ID team in collaboration with folks in Stockholm.,Teenage Engineering in this case. And we do our own graphics and marketing, all of that in house. And then for the software part, we have the device team that they need to work with the ODM/OEM. And we have the cloud team, we have the AI team. That’s basically how much team we have. And each team, there’s obviously crossovers, and we basically work project-based. So there is no crazy hierarchy going on. I mean, the biggest company I ever led was back in the Raven days. I believe by the time we got acquired, we were 250 people. So this is still within my comfort zone, to manage 50-ish people. Teenage Engineering is a big part of the Rabbit story. They obviously designed the r1 hardware, and then their founder, Jesper Kouthoofd, is your chief design officer. How much more hardware are you designing right now? Are there iterations to come? Do you have a roadmap of new products? The way we work together — obviously this is not the first time we’ve collaborated. We did a collaboration back in Raven days. First of all, Teenage Engineering is my hero company. It’s basically a fanboy dream come true story for me, and I really appreciate their help over the years. The way that we work together is very intuitive. There are obviously many ways that could be considered to be the proper way of designing a project like this, but I think we’re out of the ordinary way of doing this — I can give you an example. Back in the Raven days, all we did is that we had probably two meetings in person, a couple of phone calls, no email, no text messages. We set up a secret Instagram account that we just used to share sketches, and we just hit like on our Instagram accounts, and that’s how we designed the previous Raven project. This time, it was even quicker. I think I shared this publicly. I think we spent probably 10 minutes on deciding how the r1’s going to look like, and we had quick sketches here and there. Ultimately, I pushed Jesper for using the current color, which is the orange. We do have maybe two or three projects in our minds, but I think by the end of this year, our current focus is to really get this LAM pushed to the next level. So yeah, stay tuned. I think one thing people will realize is that this team does hardware really quick. Because when we start sketching the r1, it was like last year back in November, and we introduced that by January, and we start shipping by April. So if we want to launch the next project, it’s going to be roughly, I don’t know, six to eight months timeframe. Certainly not like a year or two. But that being said, I think... I was having my own community voice chat yesterday. I was talking to people about the current r1 because I really don’t like the current consumer electronics. Like, one year per generation by default, regardless. We’ve seen that from the smartphone companies doing annual release for all this stuff with minor changes. When we started designing the r1, the entire Rabbit OS runs out of cloud. That means that this piece of hardware, even though it’s $199 and not the latest chips, it’s really capable of offloading the future features to this device. So I don’t think r1 is like a one-year lifespan device. Our community does, though. They think they can tweak so many things about it. So in that sense, we’re not in a rush to drop another version of it, but we do have different form factors in our mind at the moment. And is Jesper actively working on those designs, or as chief design officer, is he working on something else? He was literally in our office three days ago. Yeah, we are actively working together. Correct. How much money have you raised so far? That’s a good question. I want to be accurate, but it’s somewhere around $50 million total in the whole lifespan. Last part was $35 million led by Sound Venture and also Khosla Venture, and Amazon Alexa, Foundation Synergist. So last round was $35M, and if you consider all the money together, I think it’s around $50M. When I look at the amount of money that other AI companies are going out to raise, right as we are speaking, OpenAI just raised the biggest round ever in history to go build, obviously, a foundation model, digital god, whatever Sam Altman thinks he’s doing. Do you think you can compete at $35 million a round? No, but I think talking about competition — money is one part of it. I think I’ve considered myself a veteran because I’ve done startups before. I know how it works. Certainly, money is very important, probably most important in the early couple of years. But I think when we talk about competition, we ultimately want to ship products to consumers. Because the way I look at it is that people are not buying electricity. Electricity is basically controlled by — here in California, it’s Southern California Edison, right? You have an address, you have to pay for it regardless of how much electricity you’re using. But I think people are ultimately buying microwaves, cars, motorcycles, televisions. People are buying products powered by electricity. So research-wise, I can say very clearly, we have at this moment of Rabbit, there’s no way that we can compete over OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind and Google, but how can we play the game? We become partners with everyone. Right? So r1 is hosting every single model, the latest models from these guys. Their capabilities combined with our product innovation on the Rabbit OS and all the features offered to our user. So there’s no way we can compete over on a research perspective, but we ship product fast. You saw OpenAI just released the Instant API, as they call it. I was actually invited to the meeting, but I was launching the LAM Playground yesterday, so I couldn’t be there in person. But they’re offering an API for people to build an agent for it. But yesterday, we dropped a LAM Playground, which you can go to any website and just [browse] it by voice. So I think competition is a different magnitude. I think money is definitely important. We hope that we can raise more money, of course. But I think right now, if you talk about competition, we have to play smart. They are good on the research. We are good on converting all the latest research into a piece of product that users can use today. Let’s talk about what that product is today. So right now you have the r1. You can buy it. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware. It is orange. It is very striking. It has a screen, it has a scroll dial, and then it has a connection to your service in the cloud, which goes and does stuff for you. Yep. That costs $199. Are you making money on the sale of each individual r1 unit right now? Correct. What’s the margin? What’s your profit on r1? I have my r1 right here. It’s a very good margin, even though I cannot tell you the details, but it’s over 40 percent. Do you make over 40 percent on the hardware margin of the r1? On hardware margin, which we did the math, we run the calculations. We might have to redo the math because yesterday, literally after dropping the LAN Playground, the server crashed multiple times. So we might need to redo the calculation. But again, first of all, in the beginning we’re making money. Now we have these more powerful features moving forward. I think I haven’t heard a company that went bankrupt because they got a popular service that is so popular that they couldn’t afford cloud bills. I think if you build a good product, there will be — Well, hold on, I can draw that line for you. So it’s $199. You’re making over 40 percent per unit, so that’s between $80 and $90, right? It’s not 50 percent, which would be $100, so it’s a little less. So between $80 and $90 in margin. That margin — you do have to pay your cloud bills, right? Yeah. So is that margin all being fed into your cloud bills? Obviously, we have this dedicated instance with all these cloud competitors. Right? I mean, don’t get me wrong. The Amazon AWS, they’re hosting on AWS, and there’s AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. On the LLM partnerships, we have Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini. So don’t get me wrong, it — That’s a lot of companies that like to make a lot of money. I just want to be... They’re not cheap to partner with, all those companies. They’re not cheap, but what I’m trying to point out is that they are competing so fiercely in a way that they have a lot of good benefits for the early startups. I have to shout out for all these companies. So they really want to figure out a way to help you on board and maybe making your money in the long run, but I think at this current scale, we can totally handle it, yes. So we get great deals from them. So if I buy an r1 from you, you take $90 of margin, or $80 of margin. At what point, how much do I have to use my r1 to turn that negative for you? Because everything I do with an AI, that’s a token. That token costs money. It costs multiple servers. Your bandwidth cost money. It all costs money. How much does a single r1 user have to use their r1 to take up $90 of margin, or $80 of margin from you? So I think of a moderate user using it in a non-robotic way or a non-malicious way, it’s going to be really hard to break down. But — Is that two years worth of usage? One year? Six months? I think it’s definitely over a year and a half. I’m not sure about two years because there’s new features we’re going to implement into this, including LAM Playground and teach mode. But yeah, so I want to share my understanding of this is that yes, we did the mathematics. We are making money. No problem. We wish we can sell more, which we’re hoping that we can sell more. That’s going to definitely help. But I think the target of this whole launch strategy is not set for making X amount of money on first six months. I think there’s other companies that really greedy about how they want to launch their product. I’m not going to even mention a name, so that won’t work. That won’t work. So I think if you look at any new generation of product, if the founder and the company and the board decide to set up a strategy that’s, “Let’s squeeze every single penny out of the user,” it’s not going to work. Because we know AI is very early, and we know that there’s going to be a lot of things that go wrong. In fact, I believe that every company, regardless of if you’re big or small, if you work on the latest AI stuff, the first two weeks, it’s going to be disaster because you’re going to find a lot of the misbehavior about the AI. You’re going to find a lot of the edge cases by the model. So I think the whole thing is too new. There’s no way that we want to charge for subscription. That’s even worse. I don’t like that strategy in general. So even though this sounds very concerning, that, okay, you can easily twist my story or someone might twist my story, be like, “Oh, Rabbit is doing everything great except they’re going bankrupt no matter what” right? I think there’s a very stupid way to think in that sense, because a great innovation, you have to focus on the innovative part first. Then you figure out the money part. If we start figuring out the money part now, none of this is making sense. Really. None of this is making sense. I think there’s other people in the industry that they have a great understanding of everything, and then they decided to release a wallpaper app, charge $4.50 per month. Right? Hopefully that works, I guess. You can go talk to that guy and you say, “Hey, there’s no way you’re going to bankrupt because your money checks, all this equation checks. If you charge for this, you’re going to be making money.” But that’s based on the perspective that the whole logic needs to stand up, right? So I think I’m not really wasting a lot of my time at this point on trying to basically fine tune a little about mathematical equations to make this more like, 20 percent, 50 percent. Obviously, as a startup, we need to survive, even though we have a roller coaster ride since launch. But we’re growing, and we’re surviving, and we’re still pushing the features that none of the other devices, including iPhone can do, which is a very, very good sign. So one, I don’t think anybody has ever linked criticism of Humane to criticism of Marques’ wallpaper app on our show before. Well done. I think Marques has a very different view of where his expertise is and what went wrong with that app and maybe one day we’ll talk to him about it. But my question for you, when you talk about growth and you talk about the unit economics of the Rabbit is that on some curve, the hardware becomes unprofitable for you. Just me having a Rabbit for longer than 18 months becomes unprofitable for you. That’s the moment that you would charge a subscription. You would say “to continue using this thing, it can’t be negative for our company.” And that’s the thing that I’m pushing on here. I think there are multiple solutions to that question. One is that obviously — let’s use R1 for every user for more than 18 months. There’s a couple of solutions. One is that we are going to launch the next generation device, and maybe multiple devices, that are still profitable from the hardware. Two, I think we have this prepared for since day one. From last week we’ve rolled out the alpha of Teach Mode to a very selected group of testers. I would love to give you the access, so please reach out to us later on. We’ll see if we can help you set it up. But we rolled out a very small group of our testers, roughly around 20, 25 people to be honest. And then over the last 72 hours I saw more than probably 200, more than 200 lessons or agents has been created through Teach mode. And if you look at the current Apple ecosystem or Android ecosystem, I think the hardware is not going to be the number one money contributor. It’s really hard to make on top of the margin of the hardware anyway. So at some point you want to convert that into services and software. That doesn’t mean that you’re going to charge a subscription for the device. What I think is very promising is that we are going to slowly roll out the teach mode to beta testers and hopefully by the end of this year we can grand open the teach mode as we promised on day one. So all these lessons created or Rabbits or agents created by each independent users or developers, they can be considered as a new generation of an app store. On that, we can make big money. Using the app store economics of taking 30 percent. I don’t want to invent any — exactly. I think I’m not trying to invent any new business model. I think as a startup it’s very risky to invent your own business model, but there is a very great business model out there which is App Store and that’s contributing like what, 70 percent for the annual income, right? I’m just curious, just as I’ve played with r1s and looked at the device, I’ve always wondered how on earth are you making money at $199? So that makes sense to me. When you think about what the Rabbit is actually doing, I ask it a query, it shows me a beautiful animation on the screen, which is adorable, and it goes off into the web and uses a bunch of APIs. And now the new large action model, which is the news, right? Yesterday you announced the large action model playground. People can watch it work. I’ve seen the LAM click around on The Verge’s website just to read headlines, which is neat. Is that the back end of this, I ask the Rabbit to do something and in the cloud it goes and clicks around on the web for me? So we have to separate two different systems here, maybe three different systems here. Let’s talk before yesterday, because yesterday is really a great milestone. Before yesterday, what happens is that you talk to the r1. We have an intention triage system, which basically we convert this audio to a text, we send that text to our LLM providers, and then we have an intention triage system. From there, after the LLM understand the intention we send to different APIs or different features. There are a lot of feature which is on device, right? Like set a smart timer or something like that. Or there’s a simple question, but we think that there’s other services or model probably answers better than the default LLM. So sometimes we send a particular query to Perplexity. Sometimes we send a particular query to Wolfram Alpha. So you can understand as intention triage system is dispensing on this to different destinations and then the relative features will trigger. But after yesterday, we have this playground and that’s a first stepping stone towards what we really want to create, which is a generic cross-platform agent system. It has to be generic, which on this case it is a generic. It is not cross-platform yet because it handles only a website. It will be cross-platform very soon. But with this generic website agent system, essentially you can just talk to Rabbit, be like, “Hey, go to ABC website or go somewhere and then help me do this.” So that’s exactly how we wish to design a product, and I think everyone in the industry is heading towards this direction, which is you say something, we understand you and we help you do it. And what happens as we put windows on the Rabbit hole that you can see is that the agent will break down different steps. I’m going to Google first. I’m searching for The Verge, I’m clicking to The Verge’s home website. I’m trying to find this title as you requested. I’m clicking the button to share this. And in theory you can chain multiple steps, infinite steps, follow up queries to the system. So I’ll gave you an example. I think I showed this to another reporter, it’s “hey, go to Reddit first and search for what are people recommending for the 2024 best TV 4K HDR. Get that model, then go to Best Buy, add that to my cart. If Best Buy is out of stock, then search on Amazon. If they both are out of stock, get me the second recommended model.” So you can actually chain different queries and you can pause it, you can add, you can tweak it, you can fine tune it. So it’s really just like a playground. You can freely explore the system and the system is fairly good enough to do daily tasks. And people are obviously developers and our hackers — white hat hackers of course — are giving us impressive showcases. There are people using the LAM playground to create an app just by talking to r1 because there are third party AI destinations that you can just use prompt and create an app and download the code and stuff like that. So it’s really amazing to see all this great showcases just within actually precisely 24 hours. So I want to make the marker between yesterday and the day before it, right? You announced the Rabbit at CES in January with the LAM, but it wasn’t there. Why announce it without its fundamental enabling feature? It is not accurate. I want to take this opportunity to address that. If you go to the connections, now we have seven apps. By day one we have four apps. Those are the first iteration of LAM, which is not a generic technology. We never on the CES claimed that you can now go to Amazon to order something. We said we are working towards this piece and today there’s four apps that you can connect. We are going to add more services. And over the past couple of months we did add three more services. So as of today there are seven services in total, then we keep working on the current LAM Playground and when the time is right, we swap it. So there’s a lot of debate saying LAM wasn’t there. That is not true. I can trace back to where this rumor starts is where there are people hacking into the r1. They saw r1 is fundamentally powered by an Android system on the local device, and obviously that should be the case. It would be more sketchy if it’s not Android. So at the bottom of it is an Android system and they dump the code, which — you can do that. In fact, every good piece of hardware in history has been hacked. So someone goes into this and jailbreaks the r1, which I guess every piece of hardware is jailbreakable at some point. Obviously, that’s flattering to us. If you build a form factor and no one even bothered to jailbreak it, it’s probably not a good form factor anyway. So people jailbreak it, find out the Android code, they dump the Android code to another media and they say, hey, there’s nothing about AI here. There’s nothing about LAM here. Of course, because all the stuff is in AWS. That’s where the rumor starts. And then there’s a lot of media and they just take that piece and reiterate that. The apps you started with, Spotify, DoorDash, there are a few others. Those are APIs, right? You were using their APIs. You were actually opening Spotify on the web in Chrome and clicking on it. Yes. Yes. Because what do you mean — Why? There is no API — That’s the most brittle way to use Spotify I can think of — There is no API. There is no API. You made a smart speaker. Spotify can run on smart speakers and other kinds — That’s a partnership. That’s a partnership. Go to Spotify, read their documentations. There is a specific line is that you cannot use API to build a voice-activated application. Literally. So Spotify right now on the r1, when I ask to play a song, it goes and opens Spotify on the web somewhere — Goes to the window. Yes. And then you’re re-streaming the audio to my device through your service. Correct. Correct. Yes. Does Spotify know that you’re doing this? Yes. And they’re okay with that? We had a conversation. They realize this is agent behavior. And we said, look, we ask the user to log in on your website and they’re a 100 percent legitimate user and they’re a paid user. And when we do the trick, we help them click the button. I’ve always been very curious about this. I’ve been dying to ask you these questions. So I ask my r1 to play a song. Somewhere in AWS, a virtual machine fires up, opens a web browser, opens Spotify, logs into my Spotify account using my credentials, clicks around on Spotify, pushes a button to play a song, and then you capture that audio and re-stream it to me on my r1? Everything is accurate except we don’t help you log in. You have to log in for yourself and we don’t save your connection. But the part where you are re-streaming audio that Spotify is playing to your virtual machine to me, you’re doing that? We are basically giving everyone a virtual machine, which is a VNC, which is 100 percent within policy, and you have the right to access that VNC. And on that VNC, we basically work directly on a website just like today’s LAM Playground. So we’re not getting the audio from the server from Spotify or somewhere else. We’re basically going to the Spotify website and playing — and do the things for you and play that song for you. Okay, but where do the bits go? The bits come to the virtual machine and then they come from the virtual machine to my Rabbit. Correct. So you are re-streaming the song to me. I’m not re-streaming the song to you. I’m basically presenting the VNC directly to your r1. Wait, explain how that works. Maybe I’m not technical enough to understand how that works. You’re presenting the VNC to my r1. Correct. So it is running locally on my computer? With no UI. Okay, I see what you mean. So I’m logged into a cloud computer. The r1 is the client to a cloud computer. And Spotify is playing on that cloud computer and the r1 is taking that audio. Okay. That raises a million extra questions, right? First of all, I see where you’re going. Okay? Before you go deeper, I just want to say first of all, we’re not using API. Second of all to say LAM is not there, that’s false claim. Because we have all these services, if you really pay attention to their documentation, there is no API for like DoorDash. There is no API for Uber. But I just want to be clear, that’s a choice those companies have made to prevent companies like Rabbit from automating their services and disintermediating their services from the user. So as you think about these agent models going out onto the web, however they’re expressed, whether it’s the LAM, whether it’s whatever you’re doing before the LAM Playground hit, all of those companies are going to have a point of view on whether agents can use their services in this way. That’s pretty unsettled. Yes. And I’m curious, you have a few services, they might’ve just said, okay, let’s see how this goes. But over time you’re going to enter into a much more complicated set of negotiations that will actually be probably determined by the big companies making deals, right? You can see how OpenAI or Microsoft or Amazon would make a deal to have DoorDash accessible by agents and DoorDash would say, “we’ve made this deal, you can’t be accessible.” How do you solve that problem? It’s not a problem for now. We’ll see how this problem evolves, but I remember when Apple is relatively not so big, not as big as today. When I read the Steve Jobs book, there’s one chapter. He said, okay, “go talk to Sony, from tomorrow 99 cents per track,” right? Remember that moment? So at some point this level of negotiation needs to be happening. I’m not sure if we’re leading this or someone else is leading this, but this is the working proof that we’re not using API, and I don’t think the services are not building API just because they’re trying to prevent people from automating the company. It’s just because API to them is not making money. And they for sure will love to set up a negotiation in some phase later when we grow bigger. You know, we tried to reach out to Uber, we did, before launch. They were like, “who are you? You’re too small.” That’s it. “We don’t care.” And so then you have Uber on the r1 now, that’s opening the Uber desktop app? No, the Uber website, which is very janky, which is very — That’s what I’m asking. Sorry. What I meant by desktop app is in the web browser you’re calling an Uber. If you’re running on Android, why not open an Android virtual machine and use the Android app? It is a little bit more technical to achieve that, which we are working on the other platforms. I think I showed a vary select group of people a working prototype that LAM is operating on the desktop OS such as Linux with all the local apps. So we’re definitely heading in that direction. Is there a possibility they can detect the fact that these are not human users, but in fact agent users? I guess there’s always a way that you can detect, but I think the question is — this is actually a very good topic that we’re talking about here. Think about CAPTCHAs. Sure. LAM playground or any capable AI models now can go there and solve text-based CAPTCHAs. So their old systems to prevent automated systems like this are currently failing. This is an industry effort to push everyone in the industry to rethink about — now with this AI, now with all these agents, how their business is going to reform or how all these policies need to be changed? I do agree, this is a very complicated topic, but what I can see is that this is not Rabbit doing some really fancy magic here. Every company is doing this. We have other agent companies even the GPTs are doing this. So this is a new wave emerging for all this old services that they have to think about. But I can tell you my personal experience dealing with scenarios like this, like when we first started building one of the first smart speakers back in 2013 — all this music labels, they don’t care. They didn’t care until everyone’s building smart speakers, they’re like, ‘okay, we have to resell the whole copyrights for this particular form factor.” I guess at the end of day, it’s about money. They want to sell the same copyrights to as many form factories as they want, if there’s a popular one. So we’re okay to have this kind of negotiations, but certainly like you said, there’s bigger companies that are doing similar things or even more advanced things that needs to be addressed. I give you another example like Siri and Microsoft, there’s a feature called Microsoft Recall, which they pulled back that feature now and I think they relaunched it. Which is very aggressive, that is taking screenshots of your local computer. So this is what I saw happening in AI in these early days. There’s going to be a lot of different takes and tries and eventually people will reconcile and agree on single piece of terms and agreements. But if you check how we automate the website to their interface, the most important part is we don’t create fake users. We don’t create spam users. We don’t log in on your behalf and you are you. The way I help you to do things is by help you click the buttons and mouse. It’s equivalent of, if I want my buddy to help me — I’ll give you example. So if I’m busy, I’m about to head into a meeting, I want my buddy to help me order a burger from DoorDash. All I need to do is I unlock my phone, I pass my phone to my guy and my guy helped me click that. And in this process, I’m not sharing my credentials to my buddy. I’m not telling him my phone password, I’m not telling him my DoorDash password. I’m not even sharing my credit card info. All he has to do is just add to the cart and click confirm. That’s it. So this guy is the equivalent of the first generation of LAM, which is unfortunately we don’t like it. So that’s why we work so hard. Now we have Playground, which is a more generic technology. Well, let me ask you about that difference between the first generation of LAM and the playground. The playground sounds like the thing you’ve always wanted to build. You actually have an agent that can look at web pages, understand them, take action on them. The first one, it might have been a LAM in the broader definition, but as technology it was expressed as testing software that was moving in an automated way through these interfaces. You weren’t actually understanding the interfaces. You were able to just navigate them. Because that’s pretty normal robotic process automation stuff. Were you just building on that kind of technology while the LAM came into existence? No, no. No? Okay. We’re working on neuro-symbolic, right? So the idea is that — But even in the first versions? Yeah. The question I’ve always had is, what happens if Spotify — before the LAM existed because I understand that the claim is that this version can understand every website — but if Spotify changed its interface or DoorDash changed its interface, Rabbit was kind of getting tripped up, right? I’ll tell you, Spotify changes its interface all the time and I think in the past six months, five months since the first LAM was adding the Spotify with the connection since launch. I think we probably put Spotify under maintenance for maybe two times, one hour in total. That’s a very hard proof. That’s a hard proof, but I — just take this for what it’s worth, I think that means it’s not good enough, right? The Spotify app on my phone never goes down for maintenance, and if the claim is the agent can go take actions for me, I have to rely on that at 100 percent. No — And so I think the question for me that I have, this whole thing, is the delta between what you want to do, which is have agents go and crawl the web for me and the reality of what we can do now. Actually the middle ground is APIs, the middle ground is not so brittle. You — Okay — It makes more sense to me that the agent would, instead of using an interface designed for my eyes, use an interface designed for computers. I really want to laugh hard. Okay. Really. Two things. I disagree that Spotify is not working good. Spotify has been working amazing. Sure. Five months, maybe two times we put it under maintenance and the total amount of time put under maintenance is probably under one hour. You can ask any r1 users. That’s not through API, which is impressive. That’s through agent. I’m — That’s through agent to handle to — I get that it’s impressive for an agent. I’m just saying that API — You said it’s not — I said it’s not — You said it’s not good. Good enough. I said it’s not good enough. It is not good enough. Right? Where’s the curve where it’s 100 percent? Okay, now that’s my — Because the API is 100 percent. That’s my second part. Yes, API is 100 percent, but you’re relying on, they gave you the API that’s stable, that works, that never break- I’m the user, I don’t care. That’s what I’m getting at: as the user, why should I care? The user doesn’t need to care. We need to care. Okay. We need to care and we need to care because we checked what are the good APIs we can use, don’t get me wrong, Perplexity API’s has being great. Sure. OpenAI’s API breaks every day or two and they said , “We observe an issue.” You can follow the, Is ChatGPT Down? It’s very detailed, how many breaks per day, it’s, I guess more than 10 on average that the ChatGPT API breaks or is unstable, whatever it takes. We have a notifier. So, first of all, API is not stable. It is not stable. Sure. And you have to chase for the services people want. We want to offer this music feature and we think Spotify has the best experience overall, and we want to chase for this partnership and we’re still chasing for this partnership. But to talk from a technical perspective, why I said I don’t like APIs is because — think about Alexa. Alexa speakers are all using APIs and you literally have to go there and negotiate. Because like I said, today, not everyone’s opening APIs, a lot of the traditional services don’t have APIs, and then startups, for a startup it’s impossible. wWen you go talk to them, they think you’re too small, right? We did that, we just did that to everyone. They think we’re too small, they don’t care, so we can’t get an API, Does that mean that we’re not going to figure out an alternative way to make it work? No, hell no! We’re going to make it work and this is exactly how we make it work. So we care about users to use this feature. We don’t care about how to do it. In fact, because we know that you don’t care how this has been done, I don’t want to spend six months, eight months suited up to talk to Spotify people and Uber people, and one by one, let’s do that. Well the promise here is you’re going to eventually have a general purpose LAM that is just using the web for you, right? You said you hand your phone to a buddy, which is why you can make the Rabbit device and just talk to it and it goes off and does stuff in the general case. The enormous Death Star that everyone sees is that Apple has announced substantially the same feature for Siri on the iPhone. Yeah. And Apple can get the deals and Apple can pull developers into an API relationship locally on the phone with Siri, and Apple honestly can just burn money until it chooses not to build a car or whatever it wants to do. And getting people to buy another device that doesn’t just fall back to the Spotify app on iOS when it breaks seems very challenging. How do you overcome that? Because if the technology isn’t 100 percent better 100 percent of the time, that feels like a challenging sale. Yeah, this is the fun part of the game, really. How do you win the game? I think, first of all, speaking for myself, I’ve sold my company before when I was 25. I don’t want to build another app. I should chase my same dream because I really think that the grand vision that I have and our team was working on is actually the current direction everyone’s chasing. And it just feels so bad if you don’t chase the same dream no matter how hard it is, really, and in reality, we feel blessed and happy to say the exact situation because we don’t have any serious competitors from startups to be honest. When everyone — Well there’s one, and they seem like a pretty spectacular failure, right? Yes. Humane launched with a lot of money and a big T-Mobile partnership and a subscription fee and Time magazine and all that stuff and it doesn’t seem like that has gone very well. So I said as of right now I don’t think we have serious competitors from startup and then when we talk about competitors, obviously there’s Apple, there’s every big company out there, including OpenAI. So first of all, I think this is good for us because it validates our direction is absolutely correct and I also am curious about — what are going to be the definitive routes for the generic agent technology because different people in the industry might have different ideas. There are still debatable states, there is no eval for agent systems yet, there is no very good eval yet, and you can see a lot of different research houses and companies trying different routes. Obviously there’s API routes like GPT’s, which doesn’t really take off, there’s pure neuro-symbolic routes, there’s Haber routes, there’s all this multi-modality. So we’re still in the phase of everyone trying their own recipe and hopefully that can become a definitive recipe, including Apple. I think the benefit for Apple to do that is that yes, they understand the user better, much, much better than any companies out there and they have infinite money, theoretically infinite money, and they have the very closed ecosystem. The way that they’re rolling this out is that they have this SDK called App Intent, right? So different companies or app developers need to choose to enroll or not enroll with that to have the new Siri to control stuff. I guess my relative advantage as a small group, as Rabbit, is that we move fast. We move fast and we keep growing. I think if we put all the cards on our table, we had a spectacular launch. We are the most sold dedicated hardware yet, and we have made good profit, we fix all the day one problems and the company actually quadrupled the size. So we’re growing, we’re moving fast, and now we drop this. Like you said, put a marker between today and yesterday. I think today I can say, a lot of things that you can do on r1, you cannot do it on a iPhone, I believe eventually everyone will be able to come to the same solution that all the devices can do kind of like similar stuff, but I firmly believe at least this remaining half of the year or the Q4 of 2024 and probably till Q1 2025, it is still a game of you have something that they don’t have, versus you guys all have the similar stuff, who’s done better? So I think relatively we have a good six to eight months headstart, we have our little room here, but obviously I also believe when a big company wants to kill a startup, they have a million ways to kill you. That’s just the reality. People keep talking to me and asking questions, “What happens if the risk is too high? What happens if the company dies?” I really don’t think that all these questions matter because we’re on this course, we’re going to see the end, whether it’s a good end or bad end, and I don’t think any answer to these questions will change our course to be honest. I can go here and tell you and be a cry baby like, “This is super hard, this is impossible. Everyone in the industry can kill us easily, or a YouTube reviewer can kill us by posting a review.” It doesn’t change the course because we are doing things, we’re launching, we’re shipping things, we’re moving forward. So it’ll be interesting to see what Apple came from. I was on the Apple iPhone upgrade program, so I automatically get a new iPhone every year by paying the same monthly fee, but I really don’t find any reason to upgrade that because people are talking about Rabbit being launched too early, now you have a company like Apple, if you go to the... What is that called? Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles where it’s close to here or, I guess Mission Street in San Francisco. You go to any major cities, you see these gigantic posters, billboards that Apple put there, right? iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, what are the other lines underneath? It says Apple Intelligence. Is it ready? Is it out? No. Let me talk about growth for a second. You mentioned you quadrupled and I guess you mean by employee size? Yeah. You told Fast Company last month the r1 is only being used daily by 5,000 people. Is that higher or lower than you expected? First of all, you saw that article from I guess Verge? I think — No, it’s Fast Company, that’s what it says. Yeah, no, yeah, but there’s — I’m reading it, I’m looking at it. No, but there’s a Verge [article] says r1 only has 5,000 users daily, which is from- Well that’s a quote from you. First of all, I think that what I said there can be misinterpreted. What I said is that if you go look at the data dump right now, you probably will find 5,000 people using r1. At least 5,000 people. I’m just going to quote you. Fast Company. “Lyu said, ‘Right now around 5,000 people use the r1 daily.’” I said it can be misinterpreted. Okay? Okay. First of all, I think we saw a very steady growth of all the people interacting with r1 and each time with new features, there’s going to be more people using it. I will give you some numbers that I want to throw to you and maybe I can share very detailed usage sometime in the future. First of all, there are about 5 percent of people that have their r1, they’re not happy, that return it, less than 5 percent. Sure. Which is a very good number, and I think the top features that people are using are asking questions and vision and all that, and we really are hoping for people to discover more use cases, but unfortunately we have like four or seven apps on the connections, that’s one of the bottleneck. So if you check for the total query, most of the cases you ask a question, you forget about it, so it’s not about how many times you ask r1, it’s about what kind of task you ask r1 and is r1 actually going to help you? So I guess, yeah, very unfortunate, it seems that that’s a misinterpretation. So what’s the number? What’s the daily active number? We’ll issue the correction tomorrow, what is it? I will go back and get you a very accurate number, but I can tell you yesterday our server actually crashed, so I think — Is it double? Is it 10,000? Is it 25,000? Oh, yesterday our cloud cost actually, I think... Actually, let me check right here, because I can check right here. This is why I love having a founder on the show. Okay, so the past one day is 33,760. Okay. So 33,760, yes. So almost 34K yesterday. Okay. 34,000 active users yesterday. Okay. Yeah, and — What percentage of your sales is that? Yesterday? Yeah, 33,760 people. What percentage of your total sales is that? I think we delivered more than 100,000 units, and that should be around 33 percent, 34 percent. Sure, that makes sense, and that I’m assuming yesterday, because it was a launch of LAM playground, this is a big spike. Yes. What were the days before that? So past two days, 5206, so if you minus 33, that’s another 20,000. Wait, I’m sorry, I don’t think I followed. You said numbers, but I don’t think I followed them. Past two days, say it again. So past two days, 5206, so — That’s the total of two days? Correct. Okay, and one day is with the LAM playground on, so okay, I got what you’re saying. Correct. So you’re saying it’s 5,000 active users at any time, not daily. Correct. Okay. And then you’re getting about 20,000 users daily and then we’ll see if that goes up — Correct. ... because of the LAM playground. Correct. Then there’s an article by The Verge that used that title, 5,000, which is wrong. I can tell you, that’s wrong. That’s very wrong. That’s me saying — Well, you tell Fast Company and then we will update it, but we — Well, he was a — ... ran your quote in the magazine, so we feel good about that. He wasn’t there and he... he or she. That journalist wasn’t there and that’s not what I said in the quote, okay? Welcome back. So you heard all that back and forth about Rabbit’s daily active users, and CEO Jesse Lyu saying he’d get us a better number. I asked the company to clear it up, and what Jesse actually said to Fast Company was that at any given time, Rabbit has 5,000 users. The Fast Company article has been corrected, and we’ll use Jesse’s number of between 20,000 and 34,000 daily active users, which is between – which is still substantially less than the 100,000 units sold. Now that we have the number, we’ll run it, but my question to you is, you’ve got to sell more r1s, you’ve got to get more people who’ve already bought them to continue using it, and you are, in fact, whether or not Apple Intelligence has arrived or not, it will arrive in some fashion in the coming weeks. There’s a report just a week or so ago that Jony Ive is working with Sam Altman and OpenAI on a hardware device. Something will happen with Humane, something will happen with Google, something will happen with Samsung. As that universe of competitors expands, it feels like the core technology you’re betting on is being able to automate a VNC with a large action model, right? You’re going to open up user sessions for people in the cloud and then your LAM is going to go click around on the web for them and that will get you out of the challenges of needing to strike API deals with various companies, with other kinds of deals, copyright deals with various companies, whatever you might need. Is that durable? The idea that this will keep Rabbit away from needing all of the deals that the big companies will just go pay and get? Because that’s the thing that I think about the most. I can think of 10 companies that came up with a technical solution to a legal problem, and even if the technical solution was amazing, the legal problem eventually caught up with them. We’re confident that this technology is the current technology route that it will work, and I haven’t yet seen another approach that actually makes any generic agent system work in any other manner. That doesn’t mean that we’re locked in to one technical path. If you talk to any company, it’s probably not a smart idea to say, “Hey, we just bet on this for the next 10 years.” The technology changes so fast, you have to adapt. But right now, I think we’re off to a good start, we launched a concept with playground with free of charge that you can explore so that we understand how this system can be improved. In fact, I believe the speed can be improved very fast, but we’re not here to say, “Hey, we’re stuck into this.” We do have patents about this, but we’re not saying, “Hey, we think this is the correct path to go.” I don’t think anyone in the AI industry can give you a very definitive answer, be like, “Hey, if you just do this, here’s the structure. This is going to guarantee you the best result in the long run.” I think that’s not a good way to think of it, but yeah, I agree. Everyone in the industry are experimenting with something new and a lot of companies that we saw are going to, like you said, run into some sort of legal problems. There’s music generation platforms, there’s — I mean, this feels like the story of the AI industry broadly, right? There’s a YouTube training video can be used by this or that. There’s all sorts of things like this. But I think it’s not just the builders are adapting, the industry are going to adapt to the builders too. At some point, there’s going to be a conclusion that, “Okay, this is a new policy, these are new terms that we need to follow.” Are you building to that goal? I think, again, this is just the big question I’m thinking about all of these things. Basically every AI product is a technical solution that is ahead of wherever the legal system is or wherever the business deals are. At some point Spotify might show up on your doorstep and say, “You know what? We’re not going to allow agents. It has to be a human user, and we’re going to change our terms of service to say it has to be a human user.” DoorDash might say it, whoever might say it. Are you ready for that outcome? Do you have the budget socked away to go lawyer up and fight that fight? No. At the moment we don’t have the resources to fight that fight, and at the moment, that’s not a real threat to us because they said we’re too small. [Laughs] Fair enough. When do you think the turn hits? I don’t think that it’s a dead end for us, right? No, I’m saying when do you think it’s a turn? When do you think that becomes a conversation about whether you can have agent users or human users? Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. I don’t think that they are not willing to change their terms. And I think it’s unlikely they’re going to put terms like, it has to be a human. It cannot be. There’s a lot of automation tools out there already. There’s no turning back. I think what they would like to work with any companies, including us, is that when they see a popular demand from this new kind of agent technology, they want to charge for it, and then we ask our user and us to pay for them, and that’s a business deal. That’s more like money terms. That’s what I can see. But as for now, we’re not breaking any of their terms and agreements. And if they change the terms and agreements tomorrow, we’ll take a look and we’ll see how we adapt. But the agent is out there already. There’s a lot of agents running already, so I think there’s no turning back, and it’s very unlikely to say, “Hey, we are going to stop agents using our services.” That’s not going to happen. Think on the longest timeline you can, let’s assume everything works out and it’s all solved. How much time and money is it going to take before the general purpose agent you’re trying to build is a hundred percent reliable and can just do all the things that we all imagine them being able to do? I might have a different opinion here. I think foundation models like OpenAI’s, obviously they’re raising a crazy amount of money. I think we take benefit from what they’ve been working on, because their primary services is selling their models as APIs, which saves a lot of money. We don’t want to recreate the wheel retraining an LLM. I think it might not be as scary as a lot of people might think. I think there’s a huge gap between converting the latest technology into a piece of product versus pushing for a more advanced technology. Obviously I’m very proposed to do high-end research. We want to have a research house here set up at the same scale as OpenAI and DeepMind, even though they’re already far, far behind. But I think what we’re trying to do right now at this current scale, because here’s the money we have. We don’t have $1 billion, we don’t have $2 billion. We have this very limited budget. Is that how can we convert the latest technology and research, and build to a product that we can ship early and collect feedback and learn from it? So a lot of people have different definitions of AGI. I don’t really talk about this term because I think so many people have so many definitions for it. But I do think that AI understands what you say and can help you do things, and maybe here we’re talking about virtually help you click buttons and stuff. There are a lot of companies doing humanoid android that they’re actually giving a hand and legs for the AI to do things. I think it is an entire humanity’s effort, and a lot of the resources can be shared instead of each company has to go raise for this amount of money and take that amount of time to achieve the same goal. So it’s really hard to say, but we know we need more money and resources, that’s for sure. But I think you’ve seen how efficient this team has been performing from seven people, 17 people till today. We raised obviously much less than Humane or any big companies out there. I think it’s actually one of our advantages that we can do things in a relatively cost-efficient way and fast. Timeline wise though — again, assuming everything goes your way, is it a year from now that you can build on all the foundation models and all the other investment in this thing? Just does whatever I ask on the web, is it five years? What do you think? I think the AI model will get very smart very fast, but I think we’re talking about a generational shift. I think obviously we don’t want a 2024 piece of technology operating on eBay’s website, which is basically designed back in 1990, right? So I think a lot of the infra needs to be refreshed, and the biggest gap as I can see here is productionized. So I think in our roadmap we think that it’s very likely that we can get all this separate piece of technology we have like LAM playground, Teach Mode and rabbitOS at some point, maybe next year, merged into a new rabbitOS 2.0. And that actually will push a huge step forward towards this generic goal. But my general take is that the AI model is smart enough, but the action part is a lot of infrastructure. There’s a huge gap between research and productionized, so that’s what we learned. So I will say I’m very optimistic in the three years term, but I think, like I said, right now and starting next year is everyone trying different approaches, and we’ll see which one works, but I think we’re confident on the approach we’re take right now. I just want to end by asking about form factors. Obviously the Rabbit is a very distinctive piece of hardware. People really like the design. We’ve seen just a lot of interesting glasses lately. The idea that we’re all going to work cameras on our face and someone’s going to build the display. Do you think that’s correct? I was wearing the Meta Ray-Bans yesterday. I was like, why would I wear these all the time? I’d rather have a thing. I am not against any form factors. In fact, I really think that there will be a lot of form factors. But when we were trying to design r1, the reason is that we know it’s not going to be a smartphone because we know people are going to do a lot of other things on smartphones, which the current AI cannot do. So we deliberately avoided the smartphone phone factor. Talking about pins with lasers and glasses — I have different comments for each phone factor because there’s no universal rules here. Let’s talk about pins. I think my general pushback for making it a pin with a laser like Humane, I think first of all, I think it’s really cool, but I think it’s too risky. You are trying to offer a new way of utilizing your technology, to have user use the software. That’s already new to them, and you don’t want to just introduce a sci-fi type of gear. So two new things stacked together that’s too risky. So if you look at r1, it’s a very familiar design. You know there’s a button you know you’re going to push, you know the wheel probably can scroll. There’s a screen, you can look at things. So the r1 form factor is very conservative, in the sense that it de-risks the software. It’s just like, people haven’t figured out how to interact in a virtual world, and all of a sudden back in 2016, there’s 200 different companies making goggles and they all failed. So I think I’m very, very conservative on the hardware form factor. Talking about glasses, that’s a different story. I think your skull actually grows to fit the frame, not the other way around. I used to wear prescription frames. I know the pain, your skull is growing to fit the glass frame, not the other way around. So I think there is really no generic fit on the glass frame. I was having fun with my design team joking, I’m like, “Maybe if we do the glass, we’ll probably do the Dragon Ball style,” like the power reader or whatever that is. Like the old Google Glass form factor? I can’t wrap my head around “I have to put a frame that doesn’t fit.” So we’ll see. I think the current smartphone is perfect. I really like the slate of a glass or a screen form factor, but the real problem here is not about the form factor. The problem is about the apps, right? Because now we see all this agent technology, AI stuff, and they’re doing things that apps are doing, and they’re doing things that apps can’t do, so I think the problem is with apps. I forgot to ask you the main question. You’ve had a number of startups, you’ve done a number of things, you have a big idea here. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions? I am a very intuitive person. I like to trust my intuition on big directions like what’s going to happen in the long run. But meanwhile, I’m quite conservative in that I hate to predict things. So I think when people replay this episode, they’ll hear probably that I got really tricked by some of your questions. It’s just my brain couldn’t work for predictions. It’s that I don’t like to make predictions — like what happens if this happens, if that happens, what do you think? When I manage my team, I tell people, “We make decisions based on current facts, and we find the best solutions to it.” If you spend too much time — at least, if I spend too much time thinking about what if Apple knocks on your door, what you’re going to do? What if A happens, then B happens, then C happens, what you’re going to do? Most likely you’re going to get a different strategy, right? Because if you think if B is a solution to A — when A happens, you just do B. But there are other types of people they’re like, “Hold on, have you ever thought of when A happens then D happens, then E happens, then F happens, are you still going to do B?” If you think that way, probably not. So I just choose not to predict a lot of what ifs, and I make short, clear, concise decisions based on current facts. And in fact, if you do the recap for what we launched back in the CES, it was probably the best timing. The price is probably just right, the color probably just right, and the decisions of not negotiating, spending six months negotiating with T-Mobile is probably just right. I make current decisions and that’s my style. And I talk to people, everyone talks to me. I told everyone in my team, they can find me anytime. Talk to me anytime. I spend a lot of time talk to my people. We’re, in general, just a very real team, down to earth. I really don’t like some of the other types of startups that spend too much time enjoying the feeling, if you understand what I’m indicating. But there are a lot of people that they say, “Oh, I’m a founder. I’m cool.” No, I’ve grown enough to get rid of that. Probably the same way as if I’m 21, 22, but now I’m 34. Startups are really tough. It’s a war. It’s about survival. It is really, really tough. And it doesn’t really matter if others want to do something. You have to survive, and just surviving by your own is tough in any sense. So that’s why a lot of people ask me — I get asked a lot like, “Okay, what if they do this? What if they do that?” Well, end of the day, there’s nothing you can do. You have to do your thing and they will react to it. I think it’s fair to say that with Rabbit and other startups like us, the biggest companies like Apple, they react to us. They react to us in a very hostile way, a very unusual way that they have this new phone, but all those things are still not there. We’re making very small dent, but that even doesn’t matter. I think for us, we care about our customers. One thing I want to say is that yes, there are a lot of misinformation, there are haters, there are all that feedbacks, criticisms. If you talk to the r1 user, they’re happy. That’s what I care. That’s what I care. Otherwise, there will be a lot of returns, there will be a lot of refunds. We have less than 5 percent return. Put that term in any consumer market electronics device, it’s a good benchmark, and we are going to keep releasing all the stuff. We pushed 17 OTA within five months. The other company pushed like, what? 2, 3, 4, 5 OTAs. So I really hope people can see us — we’re a bunch of underdogs. Our solution isn’t perfect, but it is David versus Goliath on day one because it’s a reality, and don’t expect perfect stuff from us because we are not perfect. We raise very little amount of money and we’re a small team, but we move fast. What we can guarantee is that when Rabbit shows you something, you probably couldn’t even find somewhere else. Just like the hardware, just like the playground or even the very janky day one version of LAM. We are the first company that has Apple Music can be streamed to our device. Yeah. Does Apple, because you’re opening it on the web? Yeah. I mean, I don’t get legal documents to my door. Maybe I will get one, but maybe they think we’re too small, but we do things in our way. I guess, that’s what I want to say. We’re really down to the ground team. That’s my style. Yeah. Jesse, thank you so much for coming to Decoder and being so game to answer these questions. I really appreciate it. Yeah, thank you so much.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's work-from-office mandate aims to help new recruits learn company work culture

Amazon Inc Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy's decision to bring back employees to the office full-time shows the executive's concern that new recruits don't understand the company culture, reported the news agency Bloomberg on Monday, October 7. Last month, Jassy surprised the employees with a memo instructing them to start coming to the office five days a week from January. Amazon currently lets many employees work from home two days a week, as per the report. The order stunned many of Amazon's more than 350,000 employees and restarted a heated debate in the tech industry about employee perks and the value of in-person work. They wonder if this was Jassy’s way of further thinning the ranks following a series of layoffs in recent years. The CEO expressed his intention to reduce management layers in efforts to reduce bureaucracy, which, according to him, was slowing down Amazon, as per the agency report. The senior leadership made the part change, as they believed the next generation of workers was being left behind rather than taught the Amazon way, according to three people aware of the development cited by the agency. Jassy mentioned the word “culture” a dozen times in his memo. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” he wrote. “You have to work at it all the time,” according to the report. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser refused to comment beyond the CEO's memo, as per the report. Amazon, which sees itself as operating like a startup, has long acknowledged that its culture may seem peculiar to outsiders. Employees pitching new ideas are expected to write detailed memos and avoid deck slides. According to the report, there’s a strong preference for analysis of data and trends and plenty of tolerance for frank and heated debate. Amazon is also famous for its tough environment and aggressive deadlines, as employees are expected to work long, hard and smart, according to founder Jeff Bezos who put it to the company's first recruits. According to the CEO's colleagues, Jassy who started at Amazon out of business school in 1997, is a product of and advocate for those approaches. After succeeding Bezos three years ago, he’s been a one-man ambassador for the Amazon culture, speaking frequently to employee groups and even cutting videos in which he explains each of Amazon’s leadership principles, said the report. Amazon doubled its headcount and reduced the requirement for recruits be physically located in a major hub with their team. Company executives have been openly saying that fresh grads, new to the workforce, are missing elements of the company's culture which cannot be effectively conveyed through videoconferences or chat windows. “Culture is a very important part of how we go and do the work, and how we have maintained the innovation and pace of what we do for the last 25 years,” said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, at a press event last week. “And that’s really hard to communicate, really hard to teach to new employees and really hard to maintain when you’re over a video call,” according to the agency report. Keeping in mind the new schedule would be controversial, senior leadership spent weeks weighing the pros and cons, according to two of the people aware of the development. The company denied the policy was designed to push employees out, according to the report. Workers expressed dissatisfaction and pressed the company to reconsider, in internal surveys. Some of the employees have already resigned and others are seeking work in other places. The last time the company ordered its employees to come back to the office for work, employees walked out at the company's Seattle headquarters, as per the report. It is unclear whether the employees will make a similar attempt again. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: 5 Stocks To Own For The 2024 Elections & Beyond!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

More Info Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. What happened next was for the history books, as Brent crude soared the most in almost two years on the back of what was a historic market imbalance with record shorts suddenly starting to run for cover... ... with the Kamala lackeys at Bloomberg going so far as to mock those who actually did the right thing and trade ahead of the inevitable squeeze as "tourists", when in reality the only tourists here are those who expected the ridiculous plunge in oil prices to persist despite Cushing approaching tank bottoms (Bloomberg's message is loud and clear: keep shorting oil unless you want to be branded a "tourist", especially since a spike in oil - and gas - prices may adversely impact its favorite presidential candidate). Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the squeeze in energy is just getting started, and not just due to fundamentals. Crude oil soared last week as a result of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the middle east. On Tuesday, spot month WTI and Brent rallied >5% from the lows on the initial headlines from the White House that an Iranian attack was imminent. Goldman's research desk noted on Tuesday that the jump in oil prices reflected a moderate risk premium as actual production disruptions have been limited and spare capacity remains elevated. The energy complex jumped again Thursday on news that the US was considering whether or not to support Israel’s potential retaliatory attacks against Iranian energy infrastructure. Then, over the weekend, the bank's commodity analysts published a new report (available to pro subs) in which they tried to calculate the impact on the price of oil should Iran oil output be "limited" by Israel, to wit: But it's not just fundamentals: Goldman's Prime Brokerage wrote in its latest weekly must-read note (also available to pro subs) that "after heightened geopolitical tensions and rising crude oil price, HFs reversed course and net bought US Energy stocks for the first time in 7 weeks, driven almost entirely by short covers." As a result, the US Energy long/short ratio increased +5% – the largest weekly increase in nearly 5 months – to 1.36, which is in the 69th percentile vs. the past year and 14th percentile vs. the past five years." That said, the short overhang in energy remains staggering, and hints at a far more brutal unwind once the upward momentum persists for another week, and not only in energy stocks where the short flow on Goldman's Prime Broekrage is just shy of record highs... ... but also in the oil patch, because after oil short interest hit a record two weeks ago as traders turned the most bearish on oil they have ever been, the amount of short covering was virtually non existent, and net managed-money (i.e., hedge fund) exposure across the 4 main oil contracts (Nymex and ICE WTI, Nymex and ICE Brent), is barely above its record lows! Putting it all together, Goldman Energy specialist Ryan Novak writes that "energy led to the upside on the week after we exited the prior week with aggressive PB selling/short selling that flipped this week, managed money positioning remains short - at all-time lows and tensions across the Middle East escalating with Israel beginning its ground invasion. E&Ps led on the week +7%. All eyes on any incremental news regarding any attack on Iranian energy infrastructure which would pose further upside risk to the commodity and equities." Bottom line: with record shorts now painfully squeezed as upward momentum has been ignited across the energy sector, and the risk of a flashing red headline that Israel has leveled Kharg Island looming, unwind of what until a week ago was a record short position in oil and energy stocks is just getting started. And that's without Israel even doing anything. Should Israel however take the plunge and either take out Iran's oil infrastructure or, worse, target its nuclear industry, then the coming explosion in oil will make the Volkswagen short squeeze of 2008 seem like quaint amateur hour.

October 07, 2024 06:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 2Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (3Q23-2Q24), webscalers represented $2.47 trillion (T) in revenues (+8.2% YoY), $301 billion (B) in R&D spending (+5.4% YoY), and $226B in capex (+15.4% YoY). They had $612B of cash and short-term investments (-8.5% YoY) on the books as of June 2024, and $527B in total debt (-3.6% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of June 2024 was $787B, up 19.8% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.182 million (M) people at the end of 2Q24, up a bit from the June 2023 total of 4.085M. Below are key highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 2Q24 were $614.4 billion (B), up 8.4% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.466 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For four straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 2Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 24.3% versus 3Q22-2Q23, followed by Microsoft (+15.7%), Alphabet (13.4%), and Amazon (12.3%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 2Q24 came from Amazon, as its revenues grew $13.6 billion from 2Q23 to end 2Q24 at $148B, up 10.1% YoY. The biggest curb on growth was Chinese ecommerce player JD.com, which recorded 2Q24 revenues of $40.2B, down $0.8B YoY (-2.0%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has been on a tear for the first two quarters of 2024, growing 25% and 51% in 1Q24 and 2Q24 respectively. That pushed 2Q24 annualized capex to $226.4 billion in 2Q24, an all-time high and up 15.4% YoY. Webscalers continue with big land purchases and long-term efforts to develop all-new data center campuses. However, the surge appears to be driven largely by technology spending, in particular purchases of servers (GPU and CPU) for data center facilities already up and running. From 44% of annualized capex in 2Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 54% of total capex for the last two quarters. The biggest capex outlays in 2Q24 came from Amazon ($17.6B), Microsoft ($13.9B), Alphabet ($13.2B), and Meta (FB) ($8.2B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 18.6% for the 2Q24 annualized period, much higher than the 16.3% and 14.4% recorded in the annualized 2Q23 and 2Q22 timeframes. Average net profit margins are also strong, totaling 18.8% for the overall market in 2Q24 annualized, from 15.2% in 2Q23 and 16.3% in 2Q22. Meta (FB) and Microsoft have the highest overall margins across these two categories. Amazon is a perpetual drag on margins despite its size. Alibaba and Alphabet both reported FCF figures substantially lower than 2Q23, impacting the market average negatively. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.18 million in June 2024, slightly up from 4.08 million in June 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Webscale employment is unlikely to rise much from here, if at all. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 2Q24 revenue growth was 3% YoY, after a 2% increase in 1Q24. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. One factor is TikTok's owner, ByteDance: this private company has exploded in the last 3 years, impacting negatively the measured growth of the publicly traded Chinese webscalers that we do track (Alibaba, Baidu, JD, and Tencent). The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

LONG BEACH, Calif. - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), a space systems company, has been selected by NASA to conduct a study for the Mars Sample Return Program, aiming to bring Martian rock samples back to Earth. This mission, if realized, would mark the first time in history that materials from Mars are retrieved for analysis, potentially advancing our understanding of the planet and the possibility of past life on its surface. The study is part of NASA's Rapid Mission Design Studies for Mars Sample Return, which seeks proposals for mission designs that can transport samples collected by the Mars Perseverance rover back to Earth. Rocket Lab's proposal suggests a simplified, cost-effective mission concept that could be executed significantly earlier and at a lower cost than the current projected sample return date in 2040. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck emphasized the company's track record in delivering cost-efficient planetary science missions. Beck stated, "We've developed an innovative mission concept to make it happen affordably and on an accelerated schedule." He highlighted Rocket Lab's experience, including delivering missions to the Moon, enabling orbital rendezvous, re-entering capsules from orbit, and contributing to NASA's Mars missions. The specifics of Rocket Lab's proposed mission architecture will be disclosed upon completion of the study in the upcoming months. Rocket Lab, founded in 2006, is recognized for its launch services, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions. The company has successfully launched 197 satellites to orbit since its first orbital launch in January 2018 and is currently developing a larger launch vehicle, Neutron, for constellation deployment. This press release contains forward-looking statements, and the final outcome of the study and any subsequent missions will depend on various factors, including technological developments and budgetary considerations. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, aerospace company Rocket Lab USA has been the subject of significant developments. KeyBanc analyst has increased the price target for Rocket Lab shares to $11.00 from the previous $8.00, maintaining an Overweight rating. This adjustment follows a roadshow with the company's CFO, Adam Spice, and reflects confidence in Rocket Lab's potential to expand its operations and its continued growth trajectory. Rocket Lab reported a substantial increase in Q2 revenue, hitting $106 million, primarily due to the success of its Electron rocket. However, Q3 revenue is projected to decrease slightly, estimated between $100 million and $105 million. The company also completed testing and integration of its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc., marking a significant advancement in in-space manufacturing and logistics. Rocket Lab also announced key personnel changes, appointing Frank Klein as its new Chief Operations Officer and adding Kenneth Possenriede, a former Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) executive, to its Board of Directors. The company is set for its 53rd Electron mission, 'Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star,' aimed at enhancing global Internet of Things connectivity. Rocket Lab has shipped two spacecraft, Blue and Gold, for NASA's Mars mission, as part of the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) project. These are recent developments in Rocket Lab's journey in the aerospace industry. Rocket Lab's selection for NASA's Mars Sample Return Program study aligns with the company's strong growth trajectory. According to InvestingPro data, Rocket Lab has demonstrated impressive revenue growth, with a 40.95% increase in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and a notable 71.25% quarterly revenue growth in Q2 2024. This growth trend supports the company's ability to take on ambitious projects like the Mars mission study. InvestingPro Tips highlight that analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year, which could be further bolstered by high-profile projects such as the NASA study. Additionally, the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility to invest in innovative mission concepts. Despite these positive indicators, it's worth noting that Rocket Lab is not currently profitable, with a negative operating income margin of -52.99% in the last twelve months. However, the company's strong market position and growth potential are reflected in its high revenue valuation multiple. For investors interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Rocket Lab, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

October 07, 2024 06:17 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range of trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company.

Good morning. On this day 22 years ago, a company named Palm introduced a mobile device called Zire, a $99 attempt to woo regular people—consumers—into using handheld computers, then called personal digital assistants. Two decades later, handheld computers are ubiquitous, and personal assistants are, shall we say, a bit more AI-flavored than they used to be. But $99? Friend, those days are long gone. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. There is not a video game company on earth that hasn’t had a tough time of it in the last two years as the passage of time eroded pandemic gains. But Ubisoft has had it tougher than most. The market value of the French maker of Assassin’s Creed has been steadily declining since it peaked in 2021. At Ubisoft’s height, you needed the equivalent of $20 to purchase a share on the Paris stock exchange; lately, you needed just $2. Ouch. So it comes as no surprise that Tencent and Ubisoft’s founding Guillemot family, which both retain minority stakes in the game publisher, are reportedly exploring taking the company private as it approaches its 39th birthday. (Ubisoft’s CEO is Yves Guillemot.) Its share price jumped more than 30% on the news. A push to go private may shield the company from investors trying to dismantle it, but it won’t rectify its challenges elsewhere. Sales of first-person shooter XDefiant underwhelmed, as did Star Wars Outlaws. Meanwhile, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been pushed to 2025 and the company’s workers in France are on the cusp of a strike. Remember, Yves: The world is an illusion. One you can either submit to, as most do, or transcend. —AN The company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has unveiled a new tool that will let people create short video clips by merely entering simple text prompts describing what they want to see and hear. Don’t count on using Meta’s new Movie Gen to become the next Steven Spielberg anytime soon, however—it’s not yet publicly available. And the clips the tool produces are limited to just 16 seconds. In announcing the service, Meta is joining a race that promises to revolutionize filmmaking. Upstarts Runway and Pika already offer similar tools, while OpenAI has developed one that is available only to a small number of users. Critics fear this new wave of AI for video creation risks being misused to spread disinformation. What is clear, though, is that Hollywood stands to both benefit from using AI to create new films and face challenges if anyone in their bedroom can do the same. —Jason Del Rey The Lone Star State has sued TikTok for allegedly misusing the data of its young users, adding to the social media company’s long list of legal woes in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed Thursday, accuses TikTok of violating a new Texas law banning social media companies from selling or sharing a minor’s data without an adult’s approval. The service is also accused of failing to add tools that let parents see how their children use social media; the current version works only if minors consent to being monitored. TikTok denied the allegations, telling the Texas Tribune that it complies with data-sharing laws and that parents can request that their kids’ accounts be deleted. Texas isn’t the only U.S. state to take TikTok to court. Utah, Nebraska, Indiana, and Arkansas have also sued the company, which is based in Los Angeles and Singapore, over alleged privacy and safety violations involving children. Of course, all of this may soon be moot. TikTok, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, is fighting for its life against the federal government’s order earlier this year that the service be sold or shut down. The clock ticks until mid-January. —Jenn Brice Over the years, major tech companies have come to define the idea of the “open web” to their own benefit—often to the disadvantage of their users. Google is the latest example of such tortured redefinition. New proposed legislation in New Zealand will force the U.S. company to compensate the news publishers that provide a significant portion of the content for its massively profitable search engine (not to mention training data for its generative AI models). Google’s response: Fine, we’ll just stop linking to news articles in our products. The company’s argument for removing the ability for New Zealand’s 5 million residents to access news articles through its popular search engine and other services is that remunerating publishers for using their content is “in conflict with the principles of the open web.” It would also harm small publishers and create unlimited financial exposure for the company, whose parent Alphabet generated $307 billion of revenue in its last full fiscal year. In recent years Australia and Canada have passed laws aimed at forcing Google and rival Meta to pay for news content that appears on their platforms. In Australia, the tech giants entered deals worth many millions; in Canada, they stopped linking to news. How distant a memory is the open web in New Zealand? We’ll soon find out. —Kali Hays Max Schrems strikes again! The Austrian-activist-turned-Meta-arch-nemesis has scored a ruling from the EU’s highest court, saying Meta and other online ad players can’t just use every morsel of someone’s personal data to target ads at them, forever. That’s because the “data minimization” principle in the General Data Protection Regulation says Facebook has to limit how long it can exploit a user’s data and the types of data that can be used for ad targeting. Schrems has been dragging Meta through the EU courts for a dozen years, leaving the wreckage of multiple EU-U.S. data-sharing agreements and forcing the Facebook owner to ask for users’ consent before targeting ads at them. He told me he was “happy to have gotten a clear ruling that Meta and other online advertisers have to minimize the use of personal data for ads.” —David Meyer —Apple Intelligence will arrive Oct. 28. Gird your iPhones. —“Salt Typhoon” cyberattack affects U.S. telcos. It links to the Chinese government. —Can you revamp Facebook for Gen Z? Meta is sure trying.

Title: Barclays sees Netflix shares out of sync with growth prospects, downgrades to underweight

Full Content:
On Monday, Barclays downgraded shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the streaming giant listed on NASDAQ: NFLX, from Equalweight to Underweight, while setting a price target of $550. The firm cited concerns over the company's growth prospects and valuation as reasons for the downgrade. The analyst from Barclays acknowledged Netflix's exceptional execution through various business model shifts and changes in the industry structure, highlighting the company's success in building the largest content and content distribution business worldwide. Netflix has been recognized as a major winner in the entertainment shift toward streaming and stands as the leading incumbent in the space. Despite these achievements, the analyst pointed out that over the past two to three years, Netflix has increasingly relied on new growth drivers, such as paid sharing, to sustain double-digit revenue growth. These strategies, however, may be accelerating future growth prematurely. Growth is reportedly slowing, and each new lever that Netflix pulls comes with trade-offs. Moreover, the analyst noted that Netflix has benefited from margin expansion being pulled forward, which may have created unrealistic expectations for the company's long-term margins and free cash flow (FCF). In light of these considerations, the firm believes that Netflix's current valuation does not align with its probable growth trajectory. Barclays' new price target reflects a more cautious outlook on Netflix's ability to maintain its growth pace in the face of evolving market dynamics and increased competition in the streaming industry. The report from Barclays suggests that investors may need to recalibrate their expectations for the company's performance moving forward. In other recent news, the Philippines has imposed a 12% value-added tax on digital services provided by tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Disney, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The move aims to create a level playing field between these global entities and local businesses. The tax could generate approximately 105 billion pesos ($1.9 billion) from 2025 to 2029, with 5% of these funds earmarked to support Philippine creative industries. On the analysts' front, KeyBanc Capital Markets has adjusted its price target for Netflix upward to $760 from the previous $735, maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm projects that Netflix could achieve earnings per share of approximately $24 in 2025 and $30 in 2026, marking an estimated 25% growth for each year. JPMorgan and Evercore ISI also show confidence in Netflix's potential, predicting that the streaming giant's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027 and maintaining an Outperform rating respectively. Netflix has scheduled its third quarter 2024 earnings release and has been making significant strides in its advertising business. The company's earnings announcement is set to be broadcast live on the Netflix Investor Relations YouTube channel, with management responding to questions from sell-side analysts. TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. The firm predicts that advertising will represent 13% of Netflix's total revenue by 2029. Disney's proposed merger with Reliance's Indian media assets is facing regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. While Barclays has downgraded Netflix, citing concerns over growth prospects and valuation, recent data from InvestingPro offers a nuanced perspective on the streaming giant's financial position. Netflix's market capitalization stands at an impressive $308.87 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the entertainment industry. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.62 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This suggests that the stock may still offer value despite its recent price appreciation. Additionally, Netflix has demonstrated strong financial performance, with a revenue growth of 13.0% and an EBITDA growth of 50.33% over the same period. Another InvestingPro Tip notes that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which aligns with the article's mention of margin expansion and free cash flow expectations. This financial stability could provide Netflix with flexibility as it navigates new growth strategies and competitive challenges. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips that could provide further insights into Netflix's market position and financial health.

Time Published: 2024-10-07T09:42:36Z

Feature-packed website builders for those with diverse needs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Squarespace is a top website builder known for its elegant designs and robust features. With over 100 premium, mobile-optimized templates, it’s a favorite for creatives and businesses seeking visually stunning, professional websites. GoDaddy Website Builder is a popular choice for beginners, offering a user-friendly interface and quick setup. With customizable templates and integrated marketing tools, it’s designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs create functional websites with ease. Creating a website is easier and more affordable than ever before. From no-code website builders to finding cheap domains and hosting plans, it seems like you can do it all for a couple of bucks. But, among countless brands, two stand out. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are well known as two of the best website builders on the market, but with many similar tools and features, it is no surprise potential customers often get confused about which one is best for them. Squarespace primarily offers a drag-and-drop website builder, dynamic website templates, and even multiple products targetting specific businesses such as dedicated templates for sellers, Bio Sites, creator tools for freelancers/ influencers, and SEO tools for digital marketers. GoDaddy's primary business is the sale of domains, and not very long ago, it started providing additional services like website building, logo making, and more. But this isn’t to say that GoDaddy isn’t a strong competitor in the website building space. In fact, in a short time, it has become one of the key players with powerful tools that are comparable to the likes of Squarespace. In this guide, we take a look at the most important areas of website building and offer a comparison between what is offered by the two players. The goal isn’t to give a generic answer to ‘which is the best website builder’, but instead provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision on which platform best suits your unique needs and goals. Squarespace pricing is straightforward, starting with the Personal plan. For $16/month (billed annually) you get features like a custom domain, SSL security, unlimited bandwidth, and Squarespace AI. If you need more, the Business plan for $23/month adds advanced website analytics, free invoices, promotional pop-ups, banners, and a nominal 3% transaction fee on sales. For ecommerce, the Basic Commerce plan at $27/month includes customer accounts, product waitlists, and low stock alerts and the Advanced Commerce plan adds advanced shipping, discounts, and abandoned cart recovery for $52/month. You can also save on your Squarespace subscription by signing up for an annual plan over monthly billing and using one of the best Squarespace promo codes at checkout. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! GoDaddy, on the other hand, starts with the Basic plan at $9.99/month, ideal for small businesses that need SSL, unlimited social media platforms alongside unified inbox and website chat. On top of this, the Standard plan adds additional marketing tools like built-in SEO and social posts for $11.99/month. Next up, the Premium plan at $14.99/month includes all the benefits of the Standard plan, plus recurring appointments. Lastly, if you just want to build an online store, the Ecommerce plan at $24.99/month is the best choice as it covers all the essentials like product listings, shipping, and abandoned cart recovery. My Verdict: Squarespace is a premium option with higher pricing, ideal for businesses and creatives needing strong design and e-commerce features. GoDaddy offers more affordable, simple plans, perfect for beginners or businesses looking for a quick and easy website setup. Squarespace’s setup and editing process are both minimalist and visually appealing. With a Fluid Engine drag-and-drop editor, Squarespace offers real-time previews of your edits and even offers many AI features to improve your website. You get dedicated theme patterns, tons of templates distributed on an industry basis, and limited yet versatile font options to fulfill your brand’s persona. If you plan on running an online store, Squarespace has dedicated e-commerce themes and well-organized sections for payments, shopping carts, and products. GoDaddy’s layout may be less visually appealing, but its editor is simpler than Squarespace's, particularly for non-technical users. With a guided walkthrough to set up your site, you can add pictures, design pages, etc., using the swipe-to-style editor both from your desktop or even your phone. Plus, GoDaddy Airo AI creates your website, logo, and more by just using details of your business. Likewise, once your ecommerce store is ready, you can upgrade to start selling and connect with top marketplaces like Instagram, Google, Etsy, eBay, Facebook, and Amazon. My Verdict: Squarespace is perfect if you want a visually-driven, customizable setup, while GoDaddy is better for beginners who value ease of use and speed over advanced design and customization. Squarespace lets you send invoices and sell content like online courses, videos, blogs, memberships as well as physical products. Further, you can use your own domain for checkout and connect with different Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems, helping create a seamless experience for your customers. If you want to go all in with your store, Squarespace provides product reviews for your customers, features for selling your products and services on Facebook and Instagram, limited availability labels, and abandoned cart recovery. On high-tier plans, you get advanced options for shipping, discounts, and access to Commerce APIs. With the GoDaddy Ecommerce plan, you can create dedicated websites to sell products. Just integrate your online store to add products and services, set up payment methods, manage shipping options and return policies, warranties, and guarantees. Plus, you can highlight featured products, integrate Square, PayPal, and Stripe, and keep subscribers informed about sales, coupon offers, and online events along with email marketing tools. GoDaddy also lets you customize your online store with WordPress and WooCommerce integration. My Verdict: Both platforms have extensive ecommerce features and support flat-rate, calculated, and free shipping, along with a range of third-party app integrations. In a nutshell, consider Squarespace if you want a neatly designed and stunning-looking online store and GoDaddy if you’re a beginner on a tight budget who just wants to get started with a simple yet effective ecommerce website. When it comes to SEO, both Squarespace and GoDaddy let you edit tags and meta descriptions, add image alt text, customize URLs, and access keyword support. But there are a few things to consider. Squarespace site comes with a site map using the .xml format, so you don't need to create one manually. Squarespace also lets you add Meta Pixel & Ads for targeted advertising. Plus, you can explore keywords with time filters and access an SEO Checklist making optimizing your site a breeze.. On the other hand, GoDaddy has a step-by-step wizard that guides you through optimizing your homepage, and if you've used it before, you can revisit tasks to refine any page, blog post, or image. Similarly, you can track your site's performance using Google Analytics and return to optimize further as needed. My Verdict: While Squarespace comes with an integrated sitemap and Meta Pixel for users who prefer simplicity, GoDaddy’s SEO wizard provides a more guided, step-by-step approach for beginners. Since both offer quite basic SEO tools, you can try their free trial to see which one suits your business better. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are solid website builders, but they cater to different needs. GoDaddy is the cheaper and faster option, perfect for those who want to get online quickly without fussing over too many details. It’s great for beginners with its straightforward email marketing process and essential features at an affordable price. GoDaddy’s guided approach is ideal for those who want to get things up and running with minimal hassle. Squarespace, while more expensive, excels in aesthetics and creative control. Its beautiful templates, drag-and-drop editor, and powerful tools like built-in SEO and automatic sitemaps make it a top choice for creatives, artists, and anyone wanting to build a visually stunning online presence. A generous student discount also makes it a great option for young entrepreneurs and creators looking to save while building something professional. In the end, if speed, simplicity, and cost are your main concerns, GoDaddy wins. But if you're after elegance, customization, and appealing aesthetics, Squarespace is a better choice.

However, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could weigh on investor sentiment this month. Nonetheless, investors could benefit by ignoring short-term noise and tracking the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts to pick stocks with attractive long-term growth potential. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is CyberArk Software (CYBR), a cybersecurity company that is mainly focused on identity security. The company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year guidance, indicating solid demand for its products. Recently, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg initiated coverage of CYBR stock with a buy rating and a price target of $328, calling it a top mid-cap cybersecurity idea. The analyst thinks that the company is in a "good position to consolidate identity spending and maintain durable and increasingly profitable growth." Hedberg expects CyberArk to sustain strong growth, driven by the demand for identity security and substantial room to grow within its core Privileged Access Management (PAM) market. Additionally, the analyst thinks that the company can grow beyond the PAM market by pursuing cross-sell opportunities in the Access, Secrets, Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) and machine identities markets. Hedberg also expects the company to benefit from its acquisition of Venafi, a machine identity specialist. He anticipates that Venafi's growth will rebound to more than 20% and be accretive to CyberArk's growth and margins over time. Overall, Hedberg is optimistic about a further rise in CyberArk's profitability and expects the company's organic growth to be above 20% for several years, backed by an estimated total addressable market (TAM) of $60 billion. Hedberg ranks No. 164 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.7%. (See CYBR Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) We move to the ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). After hosting meetings with the company's management, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reaffirmed a buy rating on UBER stock with a price target of $95. Highlighting the key takeaways from the meetings, Anmuth said that management is confident about achieving a three-year compound annual growth rate of mid- to high-teens for gross bookings, backed by a stable macro and demand backdrop since the second-quarter earnings. In particular, management stated that demand continues to be healthy in both the Mobility and Delivery businesses. Anmuth also noted the company's optimism about expanding its advertising business across Uber Eats and grocery. Notably, the ad business is on a run-rate of $1 billion (as of the second quarter) or about 1% of delivery gross bookings. In fact, delivery profits have improved over the recent quarters due to the high-margin ad business. Uber expects its grocery ad business to account for 5% of gross bookings over time. The analyst also pointed out the company's growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AV). "Uber can add value to AV tech providers by driving higher demand/utilization and building out the AV ecosystem through fleet operations," Anmuth said, based on discussions with management. Anmuth ranks No. 93 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.4%. (See UBER Stock Buybacks on TipRanks) This week's third stock pick is social media company Meta Platforms (META). At the recently held Meta Connect event, the company highlighted Quest 3S, its latest virtual reality headset, as well as other innovations, including its latest prototype of augmented-reality (AR) smart glasses (Orion) and the new features of its Meta AI chatbot. Following the announcements at the event, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reaffirmed a buy rating on Meta stock and boosted the price target to $605 from $530. The analyst attributed the higher price target to a number of factors, including significant opportunities to expand core monetization with artificial intelligence (AI)/generative AI features and the ongoing momentum in Messaging. His improved outlook also reflects "generally positive social media ad checks," with September looking better than the trends noted in August. The analyst raised his 2025 revenue and 2024 and 2025 earnings per share estimates to reflect stable macro trends, higher contributions from Messaging and enhancements related to devices and AI-driven platform. However, he slightly lowered his 2025 operating margin estimate to reflect increased networking and depreciation expenses. Commenting on Meta Connect, Sebastian said he thinks that this year's event reflects the significant progress the company has made with its Reality Labs division and AI/generative AI. Specifically, the analyst thinks that the Llama update provides a further edge to Meta's LLMs (large language models) over close rivals like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini. He is also optimistic about the innovations related to Meta AI assistant and expects it to be the most popular AI assistant by the end of 2024. Sebastian ranks No. 277 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.6%.

Title: Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears

The jobs report was so broadly strong that it signaled the end of the recent labor market cooling ... [+] trend. The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger. Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000. Monthly Job Growth The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%. Unemployment Rate Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January. Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks. Initial Jobless Claims Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well. Stock Returns Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting. U.S. CPI Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Friday’s job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Bose Reinvented Itself Just in Time. Now Comes the Tricky Part

Time Published: 2024-10-06T10:00:00Z

Bose might have turned 60, but the audio company seems to be firmly settling into its graduate school era. After late founder Amar Bose donated majority ownership to MIT in 2011—a little-known fact—it became higher-ed’s most valuable audio brand, and broadened its focus. Gone are the days of wired speakers, or a few paltry headphone options to pair with your stylish Bose Wave CD radio. In the past four years with CEO Lila Snyder—a former 15-year McKinsey consultant who is herself an MIT graduate with a master’s in mechanical engineering—Bose has seemingly righted a ship that appeared to be banking toward shore. Snyder and her team grabbed the helm after Bose shuttered its retail stores in the middle of a global pandemic. She also helped turn a rickety start in the wireless earbud and Bluetooth speaker space into some of the sleekest, best-sounding models on the market. In a world where management consultants and tech executives are known for stripping companies for parts and raising prices, Snyder and a slimmed-down Bose have maintained the brand’s noise-canceling superiority in the face of stiff competition from Apple, Sony, and others. What impresses me most about the Bose of 2024 is that it doesn’t have to play to the trends that publicly traded brands do: It has been an innovator for six decades, and it continues to be in everything from product development to retail strategy. It has quietly been deciphering the tricks behind in-car noise cancelation and beam-forming glasses, and has been developing personal line array systems for small-venue musicians. Ten years ago, I'd tell folks that beyond its excellent noise canceling, Bose offered very little for most people. Now? I’d say the company is getting dangerously close to eating Sonos’ lunch. Bose’s boxy new Smart Soundbar can pair with its Ultra Open earbuds for immersive sound in a small space. There are very few brands that have pushed personal audio technology so far forward in the past six decades. From vinyl record players to CDs, and now the streaming and portable listening era, Bose has made competitive products for higher-end listeners, even though it made a few missteps along the way—a few absolutely huge and uncomfortable pairs of early wireless earbuds, for example. It can be a surreal culture to join, Snyder says. The first female CEO of Bose, Snyder grew up a tinkerer who saved up for her first Bose radio. “I grew up with Bose as an aspirational brand, and an iconic one. And it's funny to join a company when you have stories from your background, right?” Still, even though Snyder no longer has to save up for access to the latest kit, apparently new hires and old get the same repetitive query from folks in their personal orbits. “Every Bose employee will tell you that the most common question they get is, ‘Do you get a discount?’” Snyder jokes. The company has always had premium prices, but in certain categories the products haven't always matched the brand's prestige: 2010s attempts at noise-canceling earbuds were bulky, sounded middling, and had poor battery life; and it also sold a line of too-expensive Bluetooth speakers with screens that nobody needed. Then, after its physical storefronts were not having the billboard-like effect Bose wanted, the brand, just prior to Snyder joining, decided to dramatically pivot—a word that can so often be replaced with “panic”—to a strategy that focused on online sales and bolstering exhibits in existing storefronts such as Best Buy in the United States. This seismic shift meant that every single Bose store in the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan shuttered, resulting in 119 store closures and hundreds of layoffs worldwide. So far, under Snyder's stewardship, that swerve toward online and in-store retail has, according to the company, worked out—but it could have gone the other way. Brands like Nike that have pivoted away from brand-owned retail stores have seen sales dives, but the key difference lies in Bose's decision to lean into retail partners. By bolstering exhibits in places such as Best Buy and other stores, as well as leaning into sales on Amazon and other online retailers besides its own website, Bose has been able to maintain a broad reach while also not keeping retail overhead in-house. According to Snyder, this slimmed-down approach has been effective in righting Bose's fortunes, especially when paired with excellent new products. In being a tech company that entirely focuses on audio products, Snyder says that the secret sauce at Bose is research. Engineers are constantly looking for innovation in materials, acoustics, design, production, and more. When asked about recent innovations in solid-state driver technology, for example, she isn’t shy about its prodigious market research. “What's interesting about Bose is we have been an audio company for 60 years,” says Synder. “We know we're going to be in competitive markets. We've always been in competitive markets, whether that's headphones, or in the home, or in the car. What makes us different is we're all about audio. You can be assured we experiment with everything. When we believe something’s ready, we bring it forward. We’re always looking for technology that can change the game.” This is particularly evident when it comes to noise canceling, which was pioneered by the brand for aviators—a market Snyder says Bose is proud to remain dominant in—rather than folks in the main cabin of the plane. By investigating what pilots needed to operate safely and comfortably in the cockpit, and constantly asking them for improvements and ideas, Bose was able to develop and trickle down what remain the best noise-canceling algorithms WIRED has ever tested. That makes sense, given that latest generation of Bose Quietcomfort over-ears and earbuds offer genuine professional-grade aerospace technology. Snyder says the brand uses professionals, or semi-professinals in the case of its PA gear for small-venue musicians, not only to improve its products but also to market to folks who are interested in higher-end audio. “They're a professional musician. They have a great ear. They know what great sound sounds like. Those products create a sort of halo.” However, a significant marketing tool Bose used for considerable time was NFL games, where it was the sideline sponsor for headsets for eight years, ending the partnership early this decade. The partnership has since been taken over by Sony. Bose CEO Lila Snyder at Bose headquarters Snyder with Bose’s latest over-ear headphones The other problems Bose faces are ones that top-tier makers in all industries suffer from: It must keep innovating to maintain its place atop the mountain of noise canceling; and it must continue to make other products, such as speakers and soundbars, that do the same. Current projects that excite Synder include the company’s developing work in car audio, aiming to help reduce the road noise in cars that’s even more apparent in the quieter electric vehicle era. “We have been, and we'll continue to be, everywhere that music is important to our customers,” Synder says, not-so-subtly hinting at new tech to come. “We're excited about what we're about ready to bring to the market.” In the weeks since our conversation, Bose has announced a new affordable pair of noise-canceling earbuds that have gotten rave early reviews (our review is forthcoming), as well as a new soundbar option that features an AI-based dialog mode. Bose also announced that you can pair its Ultra Open earbuds to the soundbar to use them as faux-rear speakers in surround sound—just the type of genre-bending listening she was alluding to. We expect to see more innovation and are keen to see what happens when Bose combines its beam-forming audio tech we've seen in its Frame sunglasses, and the noise-canceling and personal audio experiences it has been testing for the car. As has been true for much of its six decades, I have a feeling the best of Bose is yet to come.

Title: How to handle a potential Chinese 'bazooka'

Investing.com -- The recent stimulus announcements out of China have left investors raising questions about how to position themselves in case Beijing unleashes a more aggressive economic boost—a so-called “bazooka” stimulus. In a Tuesday note, Barclays analysts acknowledge that this is not their base case, but they emphasize that investors should prepare for such a scenario due to its potential to significantly impact global markets. Despite the recent rally in Chinese equities, the broader market reaction has been relatively subdued, leaving room for opportunities in other asset classes. Chinese equities have shown some of their largest movements in history, with the CSI 300 posting a staggering 1-week sigma move of +17.6. “The magnitude of these moves suggests that investors were unprepared for such announcements, and also that technicals, such as positioning, may have acted as a tailwind,” Barclays analysts noted. “Additionally, it also indicates that while there may be further room for upside, the bulk of the move in the near-term may be over.” The rally has largely been confined to Chinese equities and their proxies, such as European miners, but Barclays believes the real impact could come if China unveils a massive fiscal stimulus plan, like a CNY10 trillion package over two years. In such a scenario, the effects could spill over into global markets, creating opportunities in non-Chinese assets. “Notably, in a 'bazooka' scenario stimulus would likely have more farreaching effects on global assets, making upside opportunities on non-Chinese assets more attractive, given less extended moves and cheaper vol.,” analysts continued. They outlined several strategies to capitalize on this potential, focusing on oil, industrials, and U.S. stocks with high exposure to China. Among those, analysts discussed buying U.S. Oil Fund (USO (NYSE:USO)) calls, conditional on a stronger euro against the dollar, as oil is particularly sensitive to positive surprises in Chinese demand. A second opportunity lies in industrials, where Barclays advises buying hybrid XLI (Industrials) vs. SPY (S&P 500) call spreads. The Chinese credit cycle has historically been a strong leading indicator for industrials' performance, and a major stimulus could give this sector a significant boost. Finally, for investors looking for direct exposure to U.S.-China trade, Barclays screens for companies with high Chinese sales exposure and attractive volatility profiles. Top candidates include Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), which could see significant gains if China’s economy rebounds on the back of stimulus.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: JPMorgan sees significant downside risk in Tesla stock

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Mizuho desk analysts said Friday they view Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as an "out of favor long idea," noting that negative headlines and concerns over declining iPhone sales have already been factored into the price. They expect iPhone sales for fiscal 2025, particularly for the iPhone 16, to remain relatively stable, forecasting flat to low single-digit declines year-over-year—better than many fear. According to the analysts, after a challenging period through March 2025, Apple's stock could rebound, driven by the preview of a new iOS in June and the release of a more AI-integrated iPhone 17 in September 2025. “Patience will be rewarded, near-term downside risk [is] limited as buy-side super negative and short,” the analysts commented. The team at Mizuho now anticipates a 6% decline in iPhone production for 2024, revising their estimate to 220 million units, down from the previous 90 million forecast for the iPhone 16 model. Despite the downgrade for 2024, they project a recovery in 2025, with unit sales expected to rise by 8% to 239 million. This growth would be supported by the introduction of a new iPhone SE and the expected launch of the iPhone 17. Looking further ahead, the forecast for 2026 suggests iPhone sales could reach roughly 250 million units. The analysts also estimate that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 will sell around 97 million units in 2025, which represents a 10% increase over the revised estimate for the iPhone 16. Moreover, they foresee Apple starting to use its own internal modem chips with the iPhone 18, phasing out Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems by the time the iPhone 18 launches. Apple is also expected to introduce a foldable iPhone in 2027, potentially spurring further investment in G6 OLED panels. Mizuho's team believes new AI features in iOS could drive stronger upgrade and replacement cycles beginning with the iPhone 17. “Buyside feedback could not be more negative on AAPL and iPhone supply chain,” analysts continued. “Feels like a lazy and super crowded short where buyside unit estimates for CY25 iPhone likely expect negative unit growth in low-single-digits year-on-year vs sell side consensus that was 5% growth and now likely flat year-on-year.” JPMorgan issued a cautionary note for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Thursday, adjusting its price target while still predicting a potential significant downside for the stock. The bank maintained its Underweight rating on Tesla but raised the price target from $115 to $130. Still, the new price implies a downside risk of nearly 50% from Tesla’s last closing share price. "TSLA shares fell -3.5% Wednesday vs. the S&P 500 flat, ostensibly upon the release of sales and production figures indicating 3Q global deliveries tracked modestly less than our estimate and in line with Bloomberg consensus but, from our conversations, may have represented more of a miss vs. investor expectations," JPMorgan stated. JPMorgan also warned that Tesla might see its first-ever full-year decline in unit volumes, which could threaten its hypergrowth valuation. Tesla's third-quarter deliveries of 464,000 units slightly missed JPMorgan's estimate but matched Bloomberg’s consensus forecast. However, analysts believe the figures may have underperformed relative to broader investor expectations. "The continued softer trend now appears to position Tesla to potentially not grow full-year unit volumes for the first time in its history," JPMorgan explained, suggesting that this could prompt investors to reconsider Tesla's standing as a growth stock. The report highlighted Tesla's resilience in the stock market, despite its deteriorating performance over the past two years. "While TSLA shares are flat to slightly higher over the past two years, expectations have crumbled for every performance metric," the note pointed out, citing declines in unit volumes, revenue, gross margin, and free cash flow. The analysts also stressed that Tesla's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2024 are now forecasted at $7.3 billion—a sharp 74% drop from the $28 billion projected two years ago for the same period. Bank of America (BofA) analysts reaffirmed their Buy rating for Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) stock ahead of the company’s “Advancing AI” event on October 10. The analysts noted that AMD's previous AI event, held on December 6, led to significant stock gains of 19% and 80% over the following one and three months, respectively, outperforming the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s 10% and 37% increases during the same periods. The upcoming event is expected to feature roadmap updates in AI and server CPU, alongside comments from key cloud customers, which “could reinvigorate AMD stock,” the analysts said. AMD has recorded a modest 9% year-to-date (YTD) increase, trailing behind the SOX index's 22% rise. Despite growing competition in the AI accelerator market, BofA highlighted the potential for AMD to expand its market share. Consensus estimates project AMD’s AI sales to reach $5.1 billion in 2024, with the possibility of doubling to $10 billion in 2025. The current consensus for AMD’s AI sales over the 2024-2026 period stands at $5.1 billion, $9.7 billion, and $12.8 billion, respectively, which suggests AMD’s market share in AI accelerators will likely stay around 5-7%. This is significantly lower than its 20%+ market share in consumer CPUs and gaming GPUs. Although AMD has made strides in AI, BofA analysts cautioned that further expanding its market share could be difficult, given NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation’s commanding 80-85%+ market share and strong presence in cloud, along with competition from cost-optimized custom ASICs from companies like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, if AMD demonstrates a viable strategy to capture more than 10% of the AI market share by 2026, it could add approximately $5 billion in sales, with potential earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $8-$9, compared to the current consensus of $7.37. “Faster growth could also help AMD rerate towards 30-55x forward price-to-earnings (PE) it managed to trade during prior periods of rapid share gains and 40%+ annual sales growth,” BofA analysts said. “We expect AMD to emphasize its improving end-end positioning including recent acquisitions (ZT Systems, Silo AI), open-source software (ROCm) and networking (infinity fabric),” they added. Loop Capital analysts reiterated their bullish outlook on Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) this week, maintaining a Buy rating and affirming that the stock is still on track to reach $1,000 (pre-10-for-1 stock split), despite recent news of a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation. In their note, Loop Capital downplayed the significance of the DOJ inquiry, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The analysts speculated that the investigation likely pertains to shipments to countries such as China and Russia but emphasized that this is unlikely to impact Super Micro’s ongoing operations. “SMCI would be able to keep doing what it needs to do to get the 10-K filed while handling anything with the DOJ separately,” the analysts wrote. They also pointed out that Super Micro might have already been aware of the DOJ probe. Although the company has yet to publicly acknowledge the investigation, Loop Capital noted that management seemed "constructive" during recent investor events in September, suggesting that the AI server maker could already be addressing the situation. “We believe there is a legitimate possibility SMCI was already aware of anything that may now be going on with the DOJ,” the analysts added. Loop Capital remains optimistic about Super Micro’s long-term prospects, projecting normalized revenues of $40 billion, with a return to 14% gross margins and 10% operating margins. The analysts argue that these fundamentals could result in a $50 normalized earnings per share (EPS) and a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20x, supporting their view that SMCI is “a $1,000 stock.” Northland Capital Markets upgraded Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) to Outperform following the launch of Agentforce, a platform integrating Agentic AI technology. Northland highlights that Agentforce has not only matched Microsoft’s advancements in AI but may have surpassed them in terms of AI evolution. Officially rolled out on September 12th, the platform allows for the deployment of GenAI agents across sales, service, marketing, and commerce workflows. Agentforce is powered by the Atlas reasoning engine and the xLAM series of Large Action Models. This technology eliminates the need for coding to build agents on the platform. In addition, the system’s ability to transfer tasks to human agents when dealing with complex or ambiguous scenarios is seen as a key innovation, ensuring high levels of relevance and accuracy in its autonomous agents. Northland Capital Markets also mentioned the platform’s pricing model, which is based on consumption and averages $2 per conversation. This structure is designed to capture part of the value that GenAI delivers to customers. The analysts expect this development to significantly expand Salesforce’s total addressable market (TAM) for software from $0.8 trillion to $3.2 trillion, representing a four-fold increase. “We believe CRM is well positioned to capitalize on the more than 4x in software TAM we expect GenAI will drive,” Northland’s team wrote in its report. The firm extended its discounted cash flow (DCF) forecast from 8 years to 13 years, showing confidence that Salesforce is no longer constrained by average revenue per user (ARPU) limitations. As a result, Northland Capital Markets raised its 12-month price target for Salesforce to $400, up from $270.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ 00:00:02 [Speaker Changed] Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. 00:00:09 [Speaker Changed] This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio. 00:00:15 [Speaker Changed] This week on the podcast, I have a delightful guest. Kyla Scanlan is the person who created the phrase vibe session in 2022. She wrote the book In This Economy How Money and Markets really work. She is quite an accomplished 26-year-old who has built a career as a investing and economic literacy expert, helping to educate people about how the economy really works, why there’s a disconnect in what people feel versus what’s really happening, what we should think about things like sentiment and the dollar and green energy and go down the list. I thought this was a fascinating conversation. I really enjoyed it, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my interview with Kyla Scanlan. 00:01:07 [Speaker Changed] Thanks for having me. 00:01:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, thank you so much for coming. I’ve been looking forward to this since I got the book over the summer. I will tell you, I didn’t see many other people on the beach in the Hamptons reading this, but I enjoyed it. It’s filled with fun. Not only concepts, but sketches and illustrations, and I could tell you had some fun writing this. Yeah, 00:01:27 [Speaker Changed] I 00:01:27 [Speaker Changed] Did. So let’s talk a little bit about your background. You, you graduate western Kentucky in 2019, triple major financial management, economics and business data analytics. That sounds like you knew exactly what you wanted to do. 00:01:43 [Speaker Changed] Well, I didn’t. I didn’t. You did not. Yeah, I didn’t even know you could major in economics till I got to college. 00:01:48 [Speaker Changed] But in college, those three things scream markets and the economy. Right? 00:01:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, it was like kind of funny. I don’t know why there was such a big disconnect, but I was trading options when I was in high school. Right. And I got to college and I was like, oh, I’ll just be an engineer. Like I’ll, you know, do that path. And then I took an econ class as a general education course and I just loved it. And then I was like, oh, you can actually major in finance and like you can trade options for a living. Which I didn’t end up doing for obvious reasons. But yeah, so I really fell in love with the data and with the analysis and just the classes were so fun. I had a great time. 00:02:25 [Speaker Changed] You know, the old options traders joke, right? 00:02:29 [Speaker Changed] No, I 00:02:29 [Speaker Changed] Don’t really, what is it? Option traders never die. Oh, they just expire worthless. Right? I mean that’s a, that’s a classic. We’ve all dabbled with options. I, I, I find them compelling and addictive, but I, you know, 90% investor, 10% degenerate speculator. Yeah. Options are perfect for that. Yeah. How, how did you do as an option? Straighter? 00:02:50 [Speaker Changed] I did poorly, which is why I don’t really do it anymore. I’m more of a buy and hold sort of person. There you go. Yeah. But options were fun. It taught me a lot about risk. It, it taught me a lot about management. It was great. 00:03:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so you, you graduate, you joined Capital Group as an associate pretty much right into the pandemic. Tell us what you were doing at Capital Group and, and what was it like starting work right into that mess? 00:03:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it was hard. I remember I graduated, you know, basically June of 2019 and I moved out to LA from Kentucky like five days after I graduated school. I’d never been to LA before. That’s where Capital Group is based. And you know, six months later a pandemic happens. But Capital Group was wonderful. There was a rotational program that I was a part of called the CAP Group. And so I got to experience fixed income. I got to sit on an equity desk, I got to do macroeconomic research. I got to do a big stock project. But I ended up leaving to focus more on financial education because that’s where I felt I wanted to be, um-Huh. Which was really surprising. I thought I’d spend the rest of my life at Capital Group. It was kind of the perfect path. And then I was like, I just, I can’t know what happens without like trying to do this, trying to do the financial education stuff. 00:04:01 [Speaker Changed] I can’t imagine two places more different than Kentucky and la. What was that transition like? It was 00:04:08 [Speaker Changed] Really hard. Yeah. I didn’t understand what it was like to live in a big city. I’d never been to New York at that point. I’d never really left Kentucky those couple years, the whole life that I had there. And yeah, I mean I used to have to be at Capital Group very early in the morning because it’s on the west Coast, right? We do east coast hours. And so I would just like walk around really early in the morning and LA and that’s not so safe. And I got a couple of run-ins there. 00:04:33 [Speaker Changed] Oh, no kidding. Yeah. 00:04:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, because I just didn’t know any better. Like nobody gives you a playbook when you move to LA on like how to live there. And so it was, it was a really good experience. The pandemic of course was, was difficult, but it definitely helped me grow a lot faster being in a big city like that. 00:04:50 [Speaker Changed] Did the pandemic and being locked down at home lead to you writing this book? 00:04:56 [Speaker Changed] I think so. Yeah. I had a blog all throughout college that named Majuli actually was reading when I was in college, which was crazy. But it was called Scanlan on Stocks. And so I’d always been really passionate about writing, had always been really passionate about sharing ideas. And then when I got to Capital Group, obviously I was under compliance, they were like, you really can’t be talking about stocks online. That’s like not cool. And I was like, okay, fine. So I started doing these big data analysis pieces and like harvesting data from the various apps I would use that 00:05:25 [Speaker Changed] You could do just not specific stocks. 00:05:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, not specific stock stocks. So I do things like with the ride share data with Uber and Lyft that I had like dating app data, like all these different projects. But then during the pandemic, I think a lot of people, myself included were like, oh, you know, maybe I don’t wanna spend the rest of my life doing this thing. And like, I would do want to take a chance because I don’t know what’s going to happen next. And so that’s how I ended up leaving Capital Group, which was really scary. And I joined a tech startup called OnDeck and built out their investment education arm. And then, then I started doing social media basically at the same time. So 00:06:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s funny, I had the exact same experience with compliance at a brokerage firm in the early two thousands when I launched the big picture. Write whatever you want, just don’t recommend or buy or sell any specific stocks. You know, if you stay away from that, you’re fine. Which in hindsight was pretty hip. A lot of places wouldn’t even have given you that much. But data analytics, knock yourself out. Yeah. Whatever you wanna do. Yeah. 00:06:25 [Speaker Changed] Which is cool. So the name of the blog changed the Scanlan on stocks or Scanlan on stats. Sorry? 00:06:30 [Speaker Changed] On stats. 00:06:30 [Speaker Changed] On stats, yeah. It didn’t stay the same. 00:06:32 [Speaker Changed] Can scaling on stocks to scaling on stats. Yeah. So I’m, I’m fascinated by the partnership you have with O’Shaughnessy Ventures. I, I love what Jim is doing with that. Tell us about that experience and and that help you transition to what you’re doing today. 00:06:47 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. No, Jim O’Shaughnessy is amazing. So I approached him with an idea for a financial education startup and he had been, you know, really supportive him, Patrick, both his son. And I was like, Hey Jim, like I’m thinking about starting this tech company that might do financial education. And he was like, do you have a plan? And I was like, sort of. And then this book deal came along and so I was like, it’s gonna be really difficult for me to build a company and then also write a book. And I ended up deciding to focus fully on the book. And so Jim kept me on the team as an entrepreneur in residence. Right. For a year. And so that was neat. It was just kind of like almost a fellowship of sorts that supported me as I did this like book endeavor. 00:07:31 [Speaker Changed] Were you the first entrepreneur in residence that he did? Because now Nessy Ventures almost does like a MacArthur grant Yeah. To a number of people. Were were you literally the first one? 00:07:41 [Speaker Changed] I was the first one, yeah. Wow. Yeah, it, it was really cool. I think what he’s doing is incredible. It’s really nice to see, I guess, I guess you’d call it venture capital money, you know, be used in that way. Like to support 00:07:53 [Speaker Changed] These just less focused on on traditional technology companies. Exactly. And more towards content oriented things. Is that, is that a 00:08:01 [Speaker Changed] Fair description? Yeah, and like maybe stuff that isn’t going to have immediate returns. Like it’s not so much a multiple, which I think traditional VC tends to focus heavily on because that’s their whole game. But I think he is like, okay, like there’s a bunch of people who need just a little bit of money. Right? Right. Like I didn’t, they didn’t gimme a ton of money, but it was enough for me to be like, okay, I’m safe to focus on like this project that is going to take up so much of my time. Right. But also eat away at the other projects that would have earned me money. Huh. 00:08:27 [Speaker Changed] Really kinda interesting. So at your YouTube channel you do a lot of short clips, explainer videos, short form contents on financial topics, really just financial literacy and education. What motivated this idea, this is not your typical, most people go through a cycle of working their way through various aspects of Wall Street before they out of sheer frustration say, Hey, we need a lot more financial literacy and we don’t have it. What led you to financial education so young? 00:09:00 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean I think growing up in Kentucky you just kind of see like financial literacy and I sold cars, I sold Hyundais for a summer. And I think that was really formative because people would come in the car lot and they wouldn’t even really know what an interest rate was. Right. And so you were signing these people on 84 month, you know, car leases, 00:09:23 [Speaker Changed] 84 month, believe it or not, Hyundais by the way know it’s, you’re not paying off a Ferrari. You’re paying off a Hyundai. Hyundai, 00:09:29 [Speaker Changed] Right? Yeah. And like you’d have to do all sorts of financing tricks to make sure they could get a card even if their credit wasn’t so good. Right. And so I just saw a lot and I saw a lot of people that could have possibly just been helped if somebody had taught them what an interest rate was, if somebody had taught them like what a car payment meant, if what depreciation was. Right. And so that was when I was 19 and it stuck with me all throughout the rest of my time in college. I worked at a small asset manager in Kentucky called Hilliard Lyons. And I like saw a little bit of stuff there, but it was really the car dealership and just my time growing up in Kentucky that was so formative to this idea that financial education really matters. Like the fact that I didn’t know economics was a major until I got to college. Like isn’t something that should happen. Right. And so I think that’s the goal is just like, talk about econ more, make it more interesting for people. Bring more people into the fold because not only will they learn more and hopefully make better decisions, but it can also put a lot of people on a path that they might not have gone on in the first place. 00:10:34 [Speaker Changed] So I’m a little older than you. Just a touch. When I was in middle school and high school, this is how long ago the boys would get segmented off into shop class. Yeah. Where you would lose a finger if you weren’t paying attention. And the girls, and I’m saying boys and girls purposefully, ’cause we were 10 and 12, they would get shuffled off this way into home economics, which has much less to do with economics than you would imagine it. It’s more about housekeeping and cleaning and cooking, not here’s how to manage a household budget. People are perennially discussing about bringing things like civics back to high school, bringing things like basic budgeting and economics. It never seems to happen. How important is it to teach just basic economics, basic budgeting, basic things that, that we take for granted to, to high school kids? 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] I think it’s important. Would you agree 00:11:36 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent? I I, I’m, you know it, it’s amazing. I can’t remember the last time I used calculus. Yeah. But I deal with the budget every day. Yeah. I have a running total of my checking account in my head. I know where my investments are. These are all skills, you know, auto didacticism, teaching yourself this, you kind of forced to. ’cause unless you are study this as a major in college, nobody teaches you how to do this. It’s just trial and error. And hopefully the errors aren’t too, too expensive. So I I’m completely in, in agreement with you on that. And to take it a step further, the big challenge with financial literacy is it has a very short half life. Even people who are fairly financially literate, you know, six to 12 months later, half that stuff is gone. So you have to keep drilling into people, here’s how this works, here’s what happens. There’s a, there’s something you wrote sort of related to what we’re gonna talk about later that I wanna bring out here a quote from the book in this economy, which is you write that people are the economy, so let’s make the economy about the people. Explain the thinking behind that. 00:12:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean the general idea there is kind of tied into the vibe session where it’s this idea that like how people feel really matters. Like how people feel about their economic circumstances, how they feel about their ability to have upward mobility, basically, like how people are thinking about themselves is going to influence how the economy succeeds or fails. And so I think that’s just something I tried to center throughout the book was that ultimately people and the decisions that they make are the entire economy, right? Like everything that we do is, is the economy, like a coffee cup is an economic transaction, the labor, the beans, the supply chain, all of those things. And throughout the book, I tried to center people because I feel like most of the time in economics education, the reason it doesn’t work in high schools is because the kids are like, this doesn’t really relate to me. I don’t really understand budgeting. Like I don’t have any tangible experience with this. 00:13:51 [Speaker Changed] Sure they do. They have an iPhone, here’s what the iPhone costs, here’s the credit that’s built in, here’s the interest rate impact on it. Here’s supply chains from a million places. Here’s what you pay for apps. Like, I think you could take an iPhone and teach kids everything they need to know about the economy markets and budgeting one device. 00:14:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, I think that’s a great idea. And that is an experience with the economy and it’s a people-centric one. Right? And so that’s, that’s exactly it. It is like you have to sort of center it on people’s lived experiences, so that way it all feels relatable 00:14:21 [Speaker Changed] And, and you’re, so this theme comes up over and over again. You can’t separate the economy from people. It’s one and the same, isn’t it? Yeah, 00:14:29 [Speaker Changed] I would, I would definitely say so. Some people might argue with that, but I think that that is ignoring the fact that like all the decisions that people make, you know, consumer spending is such a big part of the economy, government spending, all of these things. And those are all people making decisions. Right. 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] I have to ask you, you are the ripe old age of 26. What led you a few years ago to say, I know I’m gonna write an economics book? 00:14:55 [Speaker Changed] Well, so it actually, I’ve always really loved writing. I, I wrote these books and I was eight about a penguin. And so I’ve always been writing and I wrote a book, a book, you know, quote unquote every year for, I don’t know, five or six years after, after that little penguin book. And so being an author had always been something I’d I’d had was really excited about. I never thought I’d have the opportunity so early. I never actually thought I’d have the opportunity to like be a published author. But the, how it came about was I published this piece with New York Times opinion on the Bob session and Penguin Random House approached me and they were like, have you ever thought about writing a book? And I was like, yeah, I have. And we, we came up with this idea to do a almost like a beginner guide to the economy, but with 60 illustrations all done by me just doing it in a much more fun and accessible way. You know, trying to make an economic guide for the 21st century. 00:15:55 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s funny you mentioned the penguin because in the book you compare the labor market to a goat steadily climbing a mountain. Yeah. While the Fed actively trying to slow the goat down in their progress. So first is this frequent usage of animals and metaphors something you’ve been doing a while, and what made you think of the labor market as a goat and the Fed pulling the rope trying to slow ’em down? 00:16:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, no, lots of metaphors in my, in my writing. I have a substack too, kyla substack.com and I, I always employ some sort of metaphor that I think my readers are like, okay, you know, calm down. So the book was definitely heavy with metaphors, but I really wanted there to be tangible visualizations in the book. So the beginning of the book is this economic kingdom because I think the interconnectivity of the economy is where a lot of people get stuck. It’s like, well how does the inflation, how does inflation, you know, influence labor market? How do they work? Like how does the Fed influence the labor market? How does the Fed influence inflation? How does fiscal policy work? What does the dollar do? And so I drew that at the beginning of the book as kind of like this economic kingdom land where all the castles were interacting and then yeah, the Fed and the labor market mountain or the Fed and the mountain goat. It was just another metaphor on top of that. 00:17:14 [Speaker Changed] So you tackle a number of weighty topics in the book. Let, let’s do a speed round. Tell me what people either get wrong or don’t understand about each of these issues. Let’s start with national debt. 00:17:27 [Speaker Changed] I mean, I think this is a tough one because sometimes people are right, but a lot of people think it’s totally unsustainable. Like the US is gonna go bankrupt. And there’s definitely a plausible like case that the US could go bankrupt, especially ’cause we have that debt ceiling situation that’s coming up in I think 26 days as of time of recording. And so a lot of people get that wrong where they are like, oh, the national debt’s gonna explode. The dollar is gonna not become the reserve currency anymore. 00:17:53 [Speaker Changed] By the way, I’ve been hearing that since I was in college, since Reagan was president. And it’s always, it has yet to be proven wrong. Yeah. I think if you’re wrong for half a century, you’re not early, you’re just wrong. You’re just 00:18:04 [Speaker Changed] Wrong. Absolutely. And like you could say maybe in 500 years the dollar won’t be reserved currency. 00:18:10 [Speaker Changed] And then you’re right. I won’t even give you, I’ll give you 200 years, 250 years. But 00:18:14 [Speaker Changed] If you’re dead and like, are you still right if you’re dead, you know, 00:18:18 [Speaker Changed] More importantly, does it even matter? I don’t know Right at that point. Recessions, what do people get wrong about recessions? Two 00:18:25 [Speaker Changed] Quarters of negative GDP growth. 00:18:27 [Speaker Changed] I, that is a pet peeve of mine that I have been pushing back against for years. It’s a, yeah, it’s, it’s, there have consistently been two quarters of negative GDP that haven’t been recessionary. Yeah. And if you look at what took place in 21 and 22, remember GDP people don’t realize this GDP is reported in real terms, meaning inflation adjusted terms. When you have two negative quarters, maybe it means the economy is slowing down or maybe it means the economy is overheating and prices are going up. Those are two totally different things, aren’t they? Yeah, 00:19:00 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. I think a lot of people get stuck on that one that is unpopular. Yeah, 00:19:04 [Speaker Changed] Very unpopular. What about labor market dynamics? What don’t people understand about that? 00:19:08 [Speaker Changed] I mean, I think the biggest one here is that when the labor force participation rate expands, the unemployment rate can still go up. Go up. Right? That, that’s a tough one. ’cause people are like, oh, like, well that unemployment rate is going up so people are losing their jobs. But sometimes it’s just more people are entering the labor force. Right? 00:19:25 [Speaker Changed] I, I like to call that denominator blindness. Ooh. Because people don’t pay attention, they just see the big scary number. They don’t see the context of the larger data set underneath. Like, hey, this company’s laying out, laying off 10,000 people. Is that a bad thing? Do they have 20,000 people or is it Walmart with 4 million and 10,000 is, you know, a rounding error. It’s one out of one person at every fourth store. Something crazy like that. People ignore the broader context. And you talk about context and framing throughout the book. What about housing market issues and the problem with affordable housing and first time home buyers? 00:20:04 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, housing is something I spend a ton of time on right now. I mean, I think the biggest issue is that, you know, people think that expanding the housing supply will make all home values go down. It’s not necessarily the case, right? It’s very important to expand housing supply. It’s very important that people have access to housing. So I think that’s a big one. There’s a lot of nimbyism that can arise. And then also, this is something that I don’t think a lot of people realize is that if you have a mortgage, you have to have insurance and you, which 00:20:32 [Speaker Changed] Is another crisis you talk about. Yeah, 00:20:34 [Speaker Changed] I’m really concerned about insurance right now. But yeah, I’d say those are the two things with housing. Yeah, 00:20:39 [Speaker Changed] Right there. There was an interesting piece that came out recently, I don’t remember if it was Bloomberg or somewhere else, but I definitely saw it in the past two weeks that the states that build the most amount of houses are having the fastest GDP. So if you look at places like Florida and Texas, and I think we’re probably at peak Florida right now, but hold that aside, Florida cranking up housing left and right. Texas builds a lot of houses. When you look at even fairly robust economies, California and New York, they’re growing much more slowly than those southern states. And they have horrific nimbyism and really challenging to put up new housing. Oh. Unless you’re knocking down another house in just replacing it that you can do, but expanding the amount of housing, big problem in big states. Yeah. 00:21:29 [Speaker Changed] Big problem. And it’s like, it’s kind of funny, I think we maybe saw the same graph where it’s like blue versus red. Like it’s actually a political divide where red states are doing a great job building more housing and, and blue states aren’t. And that’s, you know, we should all be building more housing because that’s kind of the housing theory of everything is something I heavily subscribe to where if people feel like they’re able to get a home, they’re able to afford it, it’s not a big worry. You know, everything will hopefully improve from that. 00:21:54 [Speaker Changed] You, you buy a house, you’re then gonna furnish it. You’re gonna buy durable goods and appliances, you’re probably gonna buy a car or two, you’re gonna spend a ton of money. It means you have a job. It means you have good credit. The housing theory of everything is pretty persuasive. Tell, tell us a little bit about that. 00:22:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean I, I think it’s, it’s super important. It is that idea that like you will participate in the economy. And I think also for, you know, there’s a chart, the distribution of financial assets from the Federal Reserve. It’s one of my favorite charts and I talk about it all the 00:22:22 [Speaker Changed] Time, is Z one flow of funds or something else. It’s 00:22:24 [Speaker Changed] A distribution of financial assets. Okay. So it shows the breakdown of wealth. 00:22:27 [Speaker Changed] Oh, by deciles or, 00:22:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. So like they’ll have like the bottom 50%, you know, the top 0.1% and if you look at the bottom 50%, all their wealth is in their house, the top 10%. It’s in business ownership and equities. So there’s a lesson to be learned there. But yeah, homes are a wealth generation tool for a lot of people. And I think to the point of like, what do people get wrong about housing is that maybe it can’t be both a speculative asset where, you know, people do invest so much into an expected to appreciate so rapidly and a place to live. I think that’s gonna be a tough dichotomy over the next few 00:23:01 [Speaker Changed] Years. Right. You know, my parents’ generation when they were buying houses for 25, 35, $40,000 and they lived through that big inflationary cycle and then rate crash over from 1980 to 2022 home, you have to live somewhere. Plus, if your home prices appreciate dramatically, hey that’s great for your retirement. I, I’m not so convinced that the current generation are gonna have the same experience. 00:23:29 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to buy a home. And I think a lot of people in my generation feel the same way. So I’m technically a Gen Z and one in four Gen Z do own homes, but 78% of them got help from their parents Right. To buy that house. And so I think that’s gonna be the thing for this upcoming generation is that it’s really going to help if your parents did well, they’re the greatest wealth tr the greatest generational wealth transfer is about to happen. 00:23:56 [Speaker Changed] It’s already happening. Right. How is it, what is it I keep seeing 48, 60 8 trillion? Yeah. Crazy, crazy numbers. 00:24:02 [Speaker Changed] 90 trillion by 2045. It’s a lot of wood. It’s a ton of money. Right. And yeah, some people will get a house outta that and I think that’s gonna be maybe the only way that you get a house. People, 00:24:13 [Speaker Changed] Even if you get a down payment out of it, it’s still, oh gosh, it’s gonna help move you in the right, right direction. Absolutely. Public transit. Give us a, what are people getting wrong about public transit? I 00:24:24 [Speaker Changed] Mean, I think people think it’s like not useful to have public transit. Whenever I come to New York, it’s so wonderful because the subway is so efficient. But I think a lot of people are like, no, we should just expand the highways. But if we invested just in light rail in these cities, rather than adding another lane to the highway, you could transmit so many more people and you could free up the gridlock. People really love their cars in the United States because it’s an, you know, it’s a place where you can go, it’s an individualistic thing. But if we are able to invest in public transit, the economy will grow. People will be able to get around better. Just imagine like, you know, not having to rely on a commute in order to go into work. It, it would expand the opportunities for so many people who right now are maybe strapped by not having a car or not wanting to do a certain commute. 00:25:12 [Speaker Changed] Right. And the data shows adding additional lanes to highways just creates additional traffic. It does not, it does not solve the problem. The other thing that’s so interesting about housing is the racial divide. When you look at who’s wealthy and who’s not and where it comes from. African Americans tend to own houses at a much lower percentage rate. When you look at the sources of wealth, let’s call it the, we’ll ignore the top quartile, like the bottom 75%. Very often people who are middle class or above housing, wealth is a big part of it. And you just see much lower ownership rates amongst blacks in America than amongst whites. Has a huge impact on income inequality by racial divides. 00:25:58 [Speaker Changed] Oh no, we have, I think, I believe income inequality has improved, but wealth inequality has worsened since the pandemic, meaning 00:26:06 [Speaker Changed] The difference between salary and your assets. Yeah, 00:26:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, yeah. So like a lot of people, you know, didn’t appreciate or didn’t get to benefit from the appreciate of the rise in stock market. Right. Values, they didn’t have a home that was appreciating and value real wages did go up. But you know, that’s not quite enough I think for a lot of people. And it has created a lot of disparity and I think that’s going to, it’s really tough to navigate that. I think the candidates for the election are like trying to figure out like, okay, how do we sort of fix this? And like, one way that the government could address it is by taxing people so they have more money so they could maybe distribute more money. But that’s very unpopular. So like we have to have a total rethink, I think, of these social programs because we’re like just helping people to close that inequality gap because that is going to be a, a massive issue over the next decade. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] And, and our last speed round question, green energy. What are your thoughts on renewable or green energy? 00:27:03 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I think it’s so important. I, I mean, I think the thing is a lot of people think it’s all or nothing. You kind of still have to have fossil fuels as you 00:27:11 [Speaker Changed] Try natural gas gonna be a transitional fuel for decades to come. 00:27:14 [Speaker Changed] Transitional is the perfect word for that. Yeah. You have to like still have all that stuff. You can’t just go green right away. But, you know, solar power is becoming extraordinarily useful. You know, hydrogen, all that stuff is solar 00:27:27 [Speaker Changed] Is now cheaper than coal. Yeah. And it’s about to become cheaper than oil. Yeah. Which is a huge, like 20 years ago, that was unthinkable. I know. 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] And it’s exciting and I think a lot of people are still stuck on, you know, oil being so important. But green energy is, is the only way that we can move forward as a society if we’re just gonna have to rely on the traditional fuels for a little longer. 00:27:47 [Speaker Changed] Tell us about, I I like the way you, you phrase this, the abundance mindset. 00:27:53 [Speaker Changed] That’s Derek Thompson’s term from the Atlantic. Yeah. He’s, he’s tremendous. But that is kinda this idea that we tend to think limiting, right? Like, we’re like, oh, we can’t have all this, we can’t have all this, we can’t have that, we can’t do this. And Derek Thompson argues like, well we can, like we can have abundance, like we can focus on immigration, we can build more housing. Like we can have all these things. We can do green energy, like we can do all of these things. Right? There’s a Keynes quote that’s about that, 00:28:21 [Speaker Changed] About scar, the scarcity mindset, right? 00:28:23 [Speaker Changed] Where it’s like, if, if the gov I think it’s, if the government can pay for it, you can do it essentially. 00:28:27 [Speaker Changed] Is that right? And why can’t the government pay for it? If you think about, you know, it’s ironic how often politicians ignore what Lord Keynes taught us a century ago, which is during economic contractions the government should spend to make up the shortfall and consumer and, and business spending. What politicians always tend to forget is, and when the economy is expanding, well then you pull back and let the private sector fill that gap. The problem is we never seem to pull back. It’s it’s pedal to the metal all the time. 00:28:58 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Which is, that’s going to be interesting with the insurance thing that we were talking about. ’cause the government’s gonna probably have to backstop all of that. And I don’t know how that’ll go, but yet 00:29:07 [Speaker Changed] Why, why should the government backstop that if you, if you move to a part of the world that is being dramatically affected by climate change? Oh, and by the way, if your state governor doesn’t believe it and refuses to do anything to moderate it, why do I as someone in a different part of the country have to bail out your bad decision? It’s one thing when a hurricane hits and, and everybody is shocked. It’s another thing when you’re building waterfront property and no private sector insurer will cover you. ’cause they’re like, no, the, the odds are you’re gone in 10 to 20 years, we’re not gonna take that risk. 00:29:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I don’t think the government should backstop those, those that, those decisions. But I, I think it’s going to be really tough because there is that mindset where it’s like, oh, I should be able to build wherever I want. And there’s, you 00:29:58 [Speaker Changed] Can build wherever you want. Well, but you just can’t insure wherever you want. And those are two very different things. 00:30:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. But people expect insurance and you can self-insure if you do cash, but Yeah. 00:30:08 [Speaker Changed] A a bank won’t finance you. Yeah. So I remember during Sandy, my wife and I went for a drive along Dune Road out in the Hamptons. And it was shocking to see what essentially is a barrier island that’s been there for hundreds of years. The ocean going straight through it. Oh wow. Like there are parts where you houses were floating away and oh my gosh, big gaps. It was crazy what had taken place there. And the Army Corp of Engineers come in and they rebuild it. The only thing that really has changed is that FEMA has mandated, I think you have to be 11 feet above sea level, above high tide. And so all these houses are built on stilts. And so you could kind of drive up to like the third or fourth step. And so by the time you get to the ground floor, you are relatively safe. If we get another sandy, the house at least shouldn’t wash away, but that doesn’t do any good if the rest of the barrier island washes away. Right. So should I know we have a shortage of housing, do we have a shortage of housing that’s ocean front? 00:31:10 [Speaker Changed] I mean, that’s a good question. It’s, it’s like not only ocean Front though, like insurers have pulled out of California too because 00:31:16 [Speaker Changed] Of wildfires, because of the 00:31:17 [Speaker Changed] Fires. Right. And they’ve pulled outta Louisiana for the same worries about of hurricanes they pulled outta Florida because of the issues with hurricanes too. And so I think it’s just like there’s an increasing climate risk and that’s across, across the board. Right. 00:31:33 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s one thing for politicians to argue about climate risk, but when insurers say, yeah, oh no, we’re not gonna cover that because we’ve done the numbers. This is an opinion. They’re uninsurable in that part of the world or that part of the country. It really raises some fascinating questions. Yeah. 00:31:49 [Speaker Changed] When Florida’s second biggest insurer is the government, it’s citizens insurance. And so that’s kind of the funny situation that we’re going to be in. You know, natural disasters are only in increasing just because of what’s happening to the environment, which is why green energy is so important. And I, I think that’ll just be a big reckoning moment where it’s like, you know, housing is so important, but we also have to have this huge conversation about how we’re going to insure these homes. Right. Because insurance has gone up 20% on average, I think, and since 2023 across the whole country. Right. Like property insurance is a huge burden for a lot of people right now. And that’s something that you have to consider with the broader conversation around what does it mean to own a home in the United States. 00:32:30 [Speaker Changed] Right. I I recall when my mom moved to Florida, you know, decades ago there was a fantastic arbitrage opportunity. The cost of living there was a fraction, real estate was a fraction. Now between taxes, problems with insurance and all the HOA fees, the homeowners association fees for condos and houses have gone up. Hmm. Because their costs have gone so much up. It doesn’t feel like that it’s a bargain anymore. Hey, maybe you get nicer weather when there’s not a hurricane. Yeah. But it doesn’t seem to be the same bargain. 00:33:01 [Speaker Changed] No, I I think Florida’s in a really unique spot as a state because they, there’s nothing that’s being done to like make the homes more insurable. Because one way that you could do that is to maybe invest in climate resilient infrastructure. 00:33:16 [Speaker Changed] No, no. It’s a hoax. We can’t waste money on that. Climate change is a 00:33:19 [Speaker Changed] Hoax. I know. It’s, it’s, it’s a And like, there’s other reasons why insurance has increased other than climate. Like you do have to talk about the reinsurance companies. They there, the people who insure the insurers, they’ve raised rates, you know, inflation has impacted the cost of everything rebuilding the homes. So like, there’s other reasons outside of climate change, but like, we can’t live in this state of denial. Not to like turn into this, into a climate change conversation. But, 00:33:41 [Speaker Changed] But it’s a, it’s a factor and it, I think it’s a more of a factor for your generation than my generation. Yeah. ’cause by the time climate change is really bad, we will be dead and buried for a long time. You’ll still be clear clearing up the mess that I like to blame my parents on. I I’m semi green, you’re probably much greener than me. I have a hybrid. I have an electric vehicle. I also, you know, fly and, and yeah. My house is probably too big relative to what I really need. Yeah. But that’s a very generational thing. You could see how, how Yeah. People’s carbon footprints really vary with, with age. So what happened with the egg situation in 2022? What did people get so wrong about that? 00:34:25 [Speaker Changed] Oh man. I, I think eggs were, it’s funny, like thinking back to it, I’m like, that was so long ago now, but it was, you know, 00:34:31 [Speaker Changed] It was a year or so ago, right. The one, so there was a chicken flu going around Yeah. That was killing Yeah. Millions of hens. Yeah. And people lost their mind when eggs were like seven, $8 a dozen. Yeah, 00:34:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. No, people freaked out. They were like, oh, you know, inflation is so bad. Everything is so bad. You know, the eggs, there’s price gouging going on, all this stuff. And it was really just kind of like a supply and demand misbalance because of the chicken flu. 00:34:56 [Speaker Changed] And there was price gouging going on, just not with eggs of all the things to point out to eggs was a legitimate, Hey, you kill 50 million chickens, guess what? Less eggs. Yeah. 00:35:05 [Speaker Changed] And I remember there being egg shortage at the grocery store. People were freaking out, but it all, I mean, it all calmed down like a month. Like it, it really normalized quite quickly. Yeah. 00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] That’s a pretty short gestation period for birds, right? 00:35:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They lay a lot of eggs good for us, I guess when we eat them. But yeah, that was just kind of, I think the, a good example of, you know, people and how important they are for the economy because how people freak out ultimately does impact how everyone feels about things. Because that was kind of like mass hysteria in a really big way too. Like the egg situation. I mean, I remember some of my friends were texting me about it and they were like, Kylo, what’s going on with the eggs? Like economically speaking 00:35:45 [Speaker Changed] By the way that, that would take you a little 30 seconds to figure out on Google. I’m always surprised, like there, there’s an acronym that I haven’t seen recently on Twitter, but it used to be, let me Google that for you. L mgt let me fy And it’s just like, come on, why are you asking me such a readily accessible answer? Ask something more complicated. But people see higher egg prices, they lose their mind. Let’s talk about something else that I found fascinating from the book. People’s eyeballs are now dollar signs. Explain what you mean by that. 00:36:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so this is something I talk a lot about in the presentations I give too, because the attention economy is really important. I think that our eyeballs are the most expensive things that we have because advertisers will pay so much to acquire them. And so I think that is both good and bad, right? Like it’s, it’s valuable as a consumer because you kind of are the product. And so a lot of products can be free, like the social networking sites, right. But I think there’s this general sense of exhaustion where people are like, I’m really sick of being advertised to, I know how expensive my attention is and I don’t wanna pay attention anymore. And so I think that’s kind of what we’re seeing with the attention economy is people are quite tired of it because their attention is so valuable. 00:36:57 [Speaker Changed] And, and you mentioned advertising. The younger guys in my office, half their wardrobe comes from Instagram. They see something they like click and, and buy it right From that it’s, it’s, it’s almost as if the advertisers are being removed from the middle. It’s, here’s an influencer wearing this. Oh, I like that. Bang. You’re, you’re purchasing it in real time. 00:37:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Instagram shopping is extraordinarily powerful and that’s true. Is is people like, and that’s kind of I think the exhaustion too. Like you do see sort of this influencer pushback. I wrote about this at the end of last year, like the influencer apocalypse that could be upon us where people are very sick of like not knowing what’s an advertisement and what’s not. Right. But there’s also such power in the curation that influencers provide that. I think it’s more just people are like, I, I don’t wanna deal with it, but I think it’s really valuable and the influencers do get paid quite a bit of money to, to be essentially a billboard for these companies. Right. 00:37:55 [Speaker Changed] You know, it’s funny because you and I both do a lot of content marketing, which is a phrase I don’t love. But anybody who pays attention to someone who does that, it’s because, hey, I’ve been following them for a while. I understand their process. I trust their judgment. They’re not for sale. And if they’re telling me, go read this or go look at that, it’s because they’ve done it and they think it’s valuable. Like, is that gonna go away? Also, what, what point, how far down does the influencer apocalypse go? 00:38:25 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know. I I wrote 00:38:26 [Speaker Changed] He he asked self, interestingly. 00:38:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, right. Like, what do you think? Yeah, I wrote this piece in February of this year around trust and ’cause I think trust is a very expensive commodity too. And I think that trust is, you know, there’s not a lot of it going around. It’s very difficult to gain trust. And so I think people will still have, you know, people like you where they trust, they, they trust your judgment. They’re like, you knows what he is talking about. He’s not gonna try and peddle me a product. But like, once you do petal somebody a product, 00:38:55 [Speaker Changed] Now variable annuity is coming to you from Right. Once that happens, 00:38:59 [Speaker Changed] Once that happens, trust 00:39:00 [Speaker Changed] Is gone. You’re done, you’re done. So I, I’ve told this war story a million times, but it’s just so perfect. The same day during the lockdown, I wanna say it was like March or April early in 2020. No, maybe it was May or June, but you know, first half of the year, still early days, I get an email f from two different companies the same day. And one was Delta saying, Hey listen, we know you’re stuck at home and this sucks. And everybody’s really frustrated. One thing you don’t have to worry, worry about are your miles. They’re gonna last forever. And your silver Medallion status now platinum, oh, your silver Medallion status won’t expire, will extend it for another 18 months. You don’t have to worry about it once you’re ready to, once this ends and you’re ready to start traveling, Delta’s ready when you are. 00:39:47 And I’m like, holy cow, that’s fantastic. And then I read the next email from Starbucks and it was, Hey, your Starbucks points, which are nonsensical things that you get a free latte if you, you know, buy enough stuff, they’re gonna expire at the end of the month. So go out and use ’em right away. And it’s like, oh wow, are you kidding me? I don’t, I don’t know if it was the juxtaposition, but I know that since then I fly Delta a whole lot and I go to Starbucks a whole lot less. Mm. And I don’t know if the guy from Chipotle is gonna do anything about that, but it just seemed like such a petty, silly, panicky thing to do. Yeah. Like, wait, the, your cost of food is like the least expensive part of the real estate, the labor, everything you do. My dumb egg white whole wheat McMuffin. You’re gonna just take that because we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Yeah. Nobody’s going to your store. Wouldn’t, don’t you don’t you wanna encourage, I I guess that was their attempt. Use it or lose it. It it that lo I’m curious your thoughts on how does corporate America capture and maintain trust from people who, my generation is arguably more loyal to brands. Like my neighbor’s grown up, he’s a Ford guy, he’s a Chevy guy. I don’t, I don’t know if that, that sort of brand loyalty really let exists anymore. 00:41:13 [Speaker Changed] There’s a really good piece called Life After Lifestyle by Toby Shoren. And he kind of talks about this how like some parts of brands are influencing culture, but it’s not the traditional brands. So it would be brands like, you know how your office guys go on Instagram, it would be like Allbirds Allbirds is now a terrible stock, but Right. That’s just one example. Like where, 00:41:32 [Speaker Changed] Oh God, we’ve had those for like seven, eight years. Yeah. That’s like mid 2 20 10. 00:41:36 [Speaker Changed] But, but that they were, they were kind of like the pinnacle of like forming some part of culture and some sort of brand identity. But as you’re saying, people jumped immediately to the next thing. Right. So I don’t think it’s like cohesive brand stories anymore. It’s kind of like these brands that patch together to create like an archetype of a person. Right, right. 00:41:54 [Speaker Changed] Especially in fashion that changes so rapidly. Although, oh gosh, these aren’t Warby Parkers, but they seem to be doing pretty okay. Yeah. Like some companies develop a relationship. I love my Maui gyms or my AKA shoes. And at a certain point, maybe this is being an old man, but it’s just like you, you just know, just reorder the next one. Yeah. Oh, these shoes are ratty. All right. Bring leave ’em out at the beach house. Order another pair. Yeah. Get a new pair. The beach house. But I don’t know if that’s true for your generation. 00:42:24 [Speaker Changed] No, I, I think it is that, you know, you sort of follow the trends. There’s a really good book by Douglas Rushkoff called Present Shock, where he talks about how everything moves in a fashion timeline now. So like people just recycle, like they, they just move through stuff so quickly because 00:42:39 [Speaker Changed] Literally fast fashion is the, is is what, you know, shine and those companies are all about. Yeah, yeah. 00:42:44 [Speaker Changed] Trends move so fast and you wanna, you know, be on top because your whole life is, you know, on on screen, 00:42:50 [Speaker Changed] On screen to say the least. So what were you looking at that led you to the phrase vibe session? 00:42:58 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean, I think for me it was really fortunate because I had all these comments. Like I was making these social media videos, so I’d get hundreds of comments a day of me talking about how GDP was going. Okay. And then people would be like, we’re in a recession, I’m upset. Like, what are you talking about? And so I was like, what’s going on? Like, why? Like the economic data’s okay, but all these people are extraordinarily upset. And so I was on a bike ride one day and I was thinking about that and it’s kind of like this disconnect of, of vibes, right? Like it’s this disconnect between consumer sentiment and economic data. And that gap is really the important part. The vibe session has taken a life of its own, which is really cool, but it’s been used incorrectly a couple of times. 00:43:37 [Speaker Changed] How do people use it incorrectly? They’ll 00:43:39 [Speaker Changed] Be like, people shouldn’t be feeling bad. It’s like, and that’s not the point of that word. 00:43:45 [Speaker Changed] That’s a generational thing, isn’t it? We, you and I were talking earlier, my buddy Dave, our, our friend, mutual friend Dave, Dave Nig was saying, Hey, people over 50 hate five session concept and people under seem to get it. What is it about the way it’s being misused that reflects a lack of comprehension 00:44:05 [Speaker Changed] From my experience of having conversations. ’cause a lot of people don’t like the word I got death threats over it. It was 00:44:12 [Speaker Changed] Ah, toxic social media. Right? But what is better than Twitter since Elmo took it over? Oh God, 00:44:18 [Speaker Changed] It’s a nightmare right now. It was lucky. This was two years ago. You know, just to make that word. ’cause I don’t know what the comments would be like currently, but we’re kind of seeing a real time social experiment with that. Like, it’s almost like four chan come back to life, but none of these people are anonymous. 00:44:35 [Speaker Changed] Well, plenty of ’em are anonymous and, and my guess is 30 40% of them are just bots. 00:44:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. That’s the, the foreign interference is a yeah. Really big thing. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] Some domestic, but a lot of China, North Korea, Russia, Russia elsewhere for sure. Russia, arguably I ran, although I I I’m not, not as convinced of, of that. Yeah. So you coined this phrase June, 2022, right? By coincidence, CPI inflation peaked at 9% in June, 2022. How much of vibe session was just utter frustration with rapidly rising inflation? 00:45:14 [Speaker Changed] A lot of it, yeah. So the way that I talk about vibe session now, you know, tears years later, is that it is an element of structural affordability, right? Like inflation is really high, even with inflation going down, that doesn’t mean the prices are going down. Housing is unaffordable as we talked about. Elder care is extraordinarily unaffordable. Childcare costs are up 32% since 2019. So like, there’s a structural affordability that is being captured in people’s vibes that doesn’t necessarily show up in the broader economic data. Like, you don’t look at GDP and say, okay, people can’t afford to put their mom in a nursing home. And there’s also media headlines, like the media has become really negative sentiment has, you know, decreased over time too. And so I think it’s those two things where it is unaffordable and then also there’s a lot of stories about things being really bad and that is creating a obsession. 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] So it’s interesting you mentioned sentiment. I I, I did a blog post around the same time and I was kind of fascinated that the University of Michigan sentiment survey was lower than the pandemic lower than the financial crisis lower than September 11th. Yeah. Lower than the.com implosion. That seemed to be wildly inappropriate. What do you, what else do you think factored into that disconnect? Well, 00:46:38 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know if you saw the Harris Guardian poll that like a lot, God, I can’t remember the exact number, but a number that is way too high percentage of people think that now is worse than the Great Depression. And so I, I think that that’s kind of what’s going on is people are like looking at circumstances and as we were talking about earlier, maybe not having context for what’s happening right now. Like right now we’re not in a great depression. It’s unaffordable, 00:47:04 [Speaker Changed] But we’re not, we’re not even in a recession. 00:47:06 [Speaker Changed] We’re not even in a recession. 00:47:07 [Speaker Changed] Arguably you were expanding two and a half, 3%. Yeah. Somewhere in that range in the third or fourth quarters of, of 2024. So I, I have to ask you this question. I, I, I forgot I looked up the quote. The, the future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed Yeah. By William Gibson. How much of what you describe vibe session is about the abundance of our economies here. It’s also not evenly distributed. Yeah. I, I’m old enough to recall that the baby boomers are in trouble. They’re never gonna pay the wealthiest generation in history. Everybody got that wrong or a lot of people got that wrong. We see Gen X doing well, we see Gen Z kind of coming up a little bit and now they’re a new generation that’s calling Gen Alpha or something like that. Yeah. So, so how does the distribution of wealth backend loaded to the oldest people who have been working and saving and investing the longest, how does that impact the concept of vibe session? 00:48:11 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there’s, so there’s a couple of things there, right? Like, there’s a saying where America has a lot of wealth, but not a lot of prosperity. And I think that’s kind of the situation where a lot of people have a lot of money and a lot of assets, but that is not evenly distributed as, as you said. And I think also because people are living longer and, you know, staying in jobs longer, taking longer to retire, there isn’t maybe as up as much upward mobility as there used to be. Well, 00:48:40 [Speaker Changed] You people hurry up and die. No. Is that I’m not, is that what’s the problem here? 00:48:44 [Speaker Changed] No, I, I just, it isn’t, it’s, I don’t think people should die. But it is interesting because there’s, I, I need to do more work on this, but there’s almost kind of like a leadership slash mentorship crisis where it seems like 00:48:59 [Speaker Changed] Certainly with remote work is giantly problematic. Yeah, 00:49:03 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Because like, how do you train up the next generation if you’re not with them? And also there is an element of resistance to training up the next generation, I think because there’s elements of ageism, like the older people don’t wanna be pushed out of their jobs, right. And they feel like that’s happening. And it’s, it’s tough within, like, within the generations too. Like I think it’s 43% of baby boomers have no retirement savings and then some of ’em have, you know, a, a 00:49:28 [Speaker Changed] Bunch a ton, right? It’s not evenly distributed. No doubt about 00:49:30 [Speaker Changed] That. Yeah. And so I, I think that’s totally true. ’cause in the US we are very much a in all or nothing society. Like you either figure it out or you don’t. Right. And there’s nobody who’s going to help you. 00:49:41 [Speaker Changed] So you’re hinting with the mentorship issue, you’re hinting at something vibe session related, which is, I mean, let’s talk about the 800 pound gorilla in the room. How big an impact was the pandemic, the lockdown being forced to work remotely, not being able to have the sort of social interaction that my generation took for granted when I was your age. How big of an impact was that mess on? And, and let’s be blunt, the pandemic was not well handled by the previous administration. You can argue that at least they got the vaccine out and it was somewhat better handled by the, the next administration, although both of them contributed cares, act one cares, act two and Cares Act three, that massive fiscal stimulus is a big part of the inflation spike. Yeah. How much did the pandemic contribute to vibe, obsession feelings? 00:50:37 [Speaker Changed] I, I think a lot. Yeah. I think, you know, to the point of social interactions, like I graduated basically into the pandemic and I still don’t know how to like talk in adult spaces, right? Right. So I think that’s a definitely a big part of it is like the lack of social interaction and then too, like a lot of people ended up just consuming content all day long. Right. And, and what goes viral as you know on social media is dor stuff, right? And so I think that’s a big thing is like, people were consuming because we were stuck inside. It was extraordinarily scary. Nobody knew what was happening. And you had people telling you that the world is ending and you’re like, okay, yeah, that makes sense to me. And you just kind of keep on consuming that info even after things get better, 00:51:21 [Speaker Changed] Right? That that lack of information hygiene is really important. Here’s another generational difference, and I want to ask you how this contributed to the vibe session. So people, I don’t know, over 50, maybe even over 40, like that, that were all already in their teens or twenties when the internet came about, the internet has always been a room in the house we would visit, yeah. Oh, I’m gonna go online for a while. Whereas the 40 and under generation, the internet has always been there. Is that true? 40 and under, let’s say 30 and under, certainly since the mid nineties. And they exist in the internet. It it, it’s not like a separate thing. It’s part of their virtual reality. So it raises the question, what’s the impact of social media on that generation’s self-identity there? The, at least a decade ago, we’re so focused on likes and social approval and you mentioned going viral. Does that lead them to be less data driven, less, more, more embracing of these subjective measures of reality, 00:52:29 [Speaker Changed] Maybe? Yeah. That’s interesting. I think definitely. Yeah. Like the internet is something that, it’s like a room that you go into in your head, right? Right. Like, you are not with other people if you’re on your phone, even if you’re around them, right? And so I think that’s something that we’re like just sort starting to grapple with. I’ve noticed it within myself where it’s like, once I start scrolling, I’m not in the room with my friends, right? Like I’m in the room on Twitter. And so I think that’s a big part of it too, where you do everything does end up being influenced by feelings versus like quantitative measures. And you kind of know how it feels in your head and you kind of extrapolate that out into the world beyond you. And so maybe we do have a more subjective generation that is like, well, this is how I feel about stuff because look how feelings perform on the internet. 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] Right? And, and listen, social media has perfected the algorithm for outrage because outrage increases engagement even as it slowly eats away like a cancer society from the inside. You know, I, I have mixed feelings on the death of Twitter as it slowly circles the drain, you think 00:53:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s gonna die? 00:53:36 [Speaker Changed] I I think it’s dead already. Really? It, so last, last summer, not 24, 23. Yeah. I lost, I, I got hacked. I call him Elmo, but Elmo decided to make you pay for two-factor authentication, which is standard security practices. It used to come with it. And I came home from dinner Saturday night. Apparently you could send an email requesting a change of password and those idiots would just do it. Like if you don’t object to it in 60 minutes, that’s something silly. So, so that’s how I lost my Twitter account. And fortunately the folks here helped me get it back. It only took three months. Wow. And again, Dave Tigan and I, I was like, lamenting this and he’s like, you’re not, you’re not missing anything. It’s died already. This is a year ago. And I’m genuinely shocked at how the engagement has gone down. Yeah. 00:54:26 How the interaction and half the people I know IRL I’ve met on Twitter over the past 15 years ago. It, it’s so ter and there’s nothing else has come along that quite matches it. Just that. So, so now I’m pretty much down to just focusing on my lists at least. It used to be with your list, you weren’t seeing a lot of other junk Yeah. That even that’s starting to get corrupted. Yeah. ’cause I know I have a list on behavioral finance and a list on, on charts and markets and economics and a list on automobiles and a list on travel and a list on, I have all these lists and I used to be able to just go, you know what, I’m just gonna spend some time learning about, you know, the hills of, of southern Spain and you could do that. And now everything is just intruded with craziness and, and politics. But it, it brings, I wanna bring this back to the vibe session question. So we’ve talked about the pandemic, we’ve talked about inflation as a driver of the vibe session. How much of this is driven by social media? How much of this is that dor loop of people who have been wrong since the financial crisis and yet still have a big 00:55:47 [Speaker Changed] Following? Yeah, no, it’s, it’s something I combat all the time with the stuff that I post on Instagram and TikTok, because that’s what goes viral is like, not the truth, but, but big scary things. And that’s a huge problem on Twitter as we both know. And so I think it is definitely an issue because like, you know, we have these animal brains and they’re trying to protect us. And so they’re like, you know, pay attention to the big scary thing. And that’s always going to be a doomers story, right? Right. Like, nobody really wants to hear, okay, the economy’s going okay. It’s like, no, the economy’s going crazy and you’re in a lot of trouble. Like, that’s what you’re gonna end up paying attention to. And so I, I think totally the vibe session has been heavily influenced by social media. Even when I was writing that initial piece, I reached out to a lot of people in my comment section who had been commenting that they were like not feeling good and that they were very worried. And there’s of course like true economic pain out there, but a lot of these people are like, oh, I read an article that things are not okay. Right. 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] And what’s the track record of that paper on that author? How, how, why do you assume that? Because it was published. It’s accurate. I’m always, yeah. I spend a lot of time fending off nonsense that clients read and say, Hey, you know, New York stock exchange margin debt is at record highs. So is the New York Stock Exchange look at the two as as long as you’re, it’s at all time highs. Yeah. Margin debt is also gonna be at all time highs. Why is that a problem? Back to denominator blindness, you gotta look at the broader context and yet people don’t seem to ask those questions. 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Do you think that’s an element of media literacy? 00:57:22 [Speaker Changed] There’s some of that. It’s also you, you brought up, you know, our, our lizard brains Yeah. Things that are good are not an existential threat. So, all right. It’s great things that are bad. Oh my goodness, this can end. Hey, I’m here to propagate my genetic lineage. Yeah. If, if this threatens that, you know, we we’re hardwired to be classic risk aversion, it’s Yeah. Losses feel twice as bad as gains because losses are an existential threat. Yeah, 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. I, I was reading this really interesting article about the, you know, propagating the genetic lineage thing because I’m really interested in the dating apps and how they’re sort of influencing the mindset of the younger generation around that. And this, this guy, he is a sociologist and he’s arguing that our brains are actually switching away from the desire to repopulate and they’re more so becoming focused on the individual. And that’s maybe why we’re having more and more of a fertility crisis. 00:58:21 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that a global issue? Oh yeah. Or are you seeing a fertility crisis around the world across the board? You mentioned the quant who works in my shop? Nick Ma, Julie. Yes. Yeah, he did some stuff years ago. Looks scraping the data from the apps. You should dig that up. I remember it was like just insane the sort of numbers he, he pulled out of that. I think I’m hard pressed to imagine that five years or 10 years of social media are gonna undo 2 million years of, of evolutionary biology. Maybe I’m wrong, but I, is this something that it’s just a novel theory? Or are you fighting against a lot of wetware and, and hardwired Yeah. Aspects of the human experience. 00:59:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. I think it’s, it’s definitely like paper covering, right. The deeper, you know, need to do that because I do think that’s a genetic desire, but it is just interesting. Yeah. And like, maybe that’s like why the vibes are disconnected, right? Like why you see these high rates of depression, anxiety, et cetera. You know, whenever you talk about society at large, you’re always pulling theories and Right. There’s always gaps in them. But I think it’s just interesting to think about like, you know, what is the impact of dating apps? What is the impact of being on social media and seeing, you know, not real faces but edited faces, right? Like how does that impact how we actually exist in the real world and ultimately how we feel about everything that we’re doing and the economy at large. 00:59:42 [Speaker Changed] Well, well we know that kids have a much higher depression rate than they used to. Yeah. Ever since, you know, the iPhone came out. Yeah. And all the apps it, so it’s having a real effect. All right. Which leads to my last vibe session question, which is there were a number of economists who thought a vibe session would be a self-fulfilling prophecy and that we would end up a negative sentiment would end up driving recession. That didn’t happen. Why? 01:00:10 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That, that was good. That was actually the title of the original piece. You know, vibe session self, a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I, I don’t think it ended up happening because the economic data has been so strong. Like the government is spending a lot of money, right. And that’s going to help prop up GDP and that’s going to help prop up the consumer. The consumer had an incredible savings buffer post covid and we did see a real wage gains. And so you had a resilient consumer who is ready to spend, especially on services. And so I think that helped us avoid a recession as we had a government who’s, you know, spending a lot of money. And then we had a consumer that up until recently has been quite strong in a labor market that was incredibly strong. We’re seeing weakness in that now, but I think that’s why we were able to avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy aspect of it. 01:00:54 [Speaker Changed] Are we really seeing weakness or are we just seeing less strength than we did before? We’re 01:00:58 [Speaker Changed] Seeing that’s, that’s a good point. It’s more lukewarm versus hot. Yeah. 01:01:01 [Speaker Changed] Right. And and the crazy thing, I think people, so you talk about the abundance mindset earlier. There are a couple of areas in the economy that scarcity is taken. So we don’t have enough single family homes. Yeah. There aren’t enough laborers. We’ve reduced the number of, of legal immigrants since nine 11. We lost a whole bunch of people to CO we launched, we have removed a whole bunch of people from the labor force through disability, including long COVID. Arguably we’re short two or 3 million houses. We’re short a few million automobiles due to the lag in ramping up semiconductor production. And we’re also short, I don’t know, pick a number. 1, 2, 3, 4 million laborers out of a labor pool of 162 million people. So we have all this abundance and yet at the same time there’s scarcity in very specific areas. 01:01:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, absolutely. And the abundance mindset is like, we can have all these things in great numbers and like, it doesn’t have to be this issue where there’s not enough of things. And that creates so much wording and concern for people. But yeah, I think that’s kind of the issue across the board is we don’t have enough and yet we have so much money as a country. Right. 01:02:13 [Speaker Changed] And so wealth but not prosperity. Exactly. I love that dichotomy where if you go to, I remember remember being in Europe right during the.com implosion and everybody was so stressed out in Manhattan, you could feel like, Hey, I get fired, I’m gonna lose my health insurance. What’s gonna happen if my kid needs a operation? You go to Europe and they’re in the cafes having coffee and they’re smoking clove cigarettes and nobody really seems to be bent outta shape that hey, the technology is imploding 80%, they’re all kind of just grooving life. Yeah. It’s a very different mindset where the focus isn’t on wealth, but it’s on prosperity. Yeah. It, it, it, are there that much geographic differences? Is the United States that unique compared to the rest of the world? 01:03:01 [Speaker Changed] I don’t, I mean I think the, there’s actually a big conversation kind of happening around this right now, like why the United States sort of does this to itself. And I, I think the US has these elements of workaholics. Like we, we love the work and Europe maybe doesn’t, but yeah, we’ve chosen maybe not to spend so much on, on the social aspect of it. And you do see consequences of that. Like I think having a social safety net for people is a really good buffer. Like once you have a sense of security, there’s kind of a lot that you can achieve. 01:03:33 [Speaker Changed] A lot less stress also. Yeah, absolutely. Although, although arguably we don’t have that safety net. We don’t And we’ve achieved a, I think the stress is what has driven us. 01:03:42 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Because we’re, we know that we have to have a safety net. 01:03:45 [Speaker Changed] You better get off your and go do something otherwise no one’s feeding you Good luck being homeless. Oh gosh. Which kind of is really about, about the Wall Street bets and all the crypto bros that have fun being poor. Yeah. Was such an interesting basic approach to No, no, you gotta go do something. Even if it’s something like NFTs or crypto, figure something out. Yeah. That’s a uniquely American proposition. 01:04:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, absolutely. ’cause there’s nobody to catch you. Right. And so like, you have to go invest in Dogecoin and that’s like now we have this gambling issue as a society like sports gambling. 01:04:20 [Speaker Changed] Oh, unbelievable. Oh 01:04:21 [Speaker Changed] Gosh. It’s awful. Yeah. And it is, I really do believe it’s because we don’t have a safety net for people. And so they’re like, I don’t know what to do. I’ll just gamble my money. 01:04:29 [Speaker Changed] That makes sense. Yeah. Usually if I don’t know what to do, I, I I’ll go watch YouTube, but hey, whatever, whatever you have to do. So the vibe session did not become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have to do a compare and contrast with something you wrote in the book. Inflation is entirely dependent on what people expect to happen. I disagree, but I want you to explain why you think that is. 01:04:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So this is definitely an unpopular opinion. Jerome Powell actually talked about this in his Jackson Hole speech. You know, inflation expectations have been tempered so people don’t expect as much inflation as it used to. And that’ll help the Fed, you know, so let 01:05:07 [Speaker Changed] Tap on it. So lemme just, lemme just stop you right there. So after inflation has fallen from 9% to 2%, their expectations go down. That sounds quite backwards looking and lagging. Let me also point out that when inflation was about to spike up in 2001, everybody’s forward inflation expectations were pretty low. Isn’t this like asking people what their risk tolerance is? Aren’t you just getting whatever happened over the past six to 12 months? 01:05:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, usually. But I, I think the, the reason I said that in the book was like the expectations do matter and they’ll ultimately influence how the Federal Reserve makes decisions. 01:05:45 [Speaker Changed] I mean, Jerome Powell a hundred percent agrees with that. I just think he’s wrong 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] Because you think it’s what? Like what, like you think inflation 01:05:51 [Speaker Changed] Is. I think people don’t know what the hell they think. They certainly don’t know what they’re gonna do. You ask them a question they don’t know. And because of the American educational experience where we’re tested within inches of our lives, hey, no penalties for filling in that bubble on your multiple choice. So people, nobody likes to say, I don’t know. So here’s a made up answer I guess. Go away. I can, I could talk about this stuff with you forever, but we have a hard stop. So I, I have to get to to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests. Starting with what’s keeping you entertained these days? What, what are you listening to on podcasts or watching on Netflix, Amazon, Disney, what, whatever you like. 01:06:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I really like the podcast Philosophize this, 01:06:38 [Speaker Changed] Philosophize 01:06:39 [Speaker Changed] This, yeah. That’s one of my favorite podcasts. It’s by Steven West and he talks all about the different schools of philosophy. It goes back to the very beginning and it’s, it’s just phenomenal. And he walks you through everything and all the different schools of thought. And I, I think he does a fantastic job. And then there’s this series called Land of the Giants by Vox. Have you heard of 01:07:02 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:03 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:07 [Speaker Changed] Times and now he’s at Fox, I 01:07:11 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:13 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:16 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:16 [Speaker Changed] 01:07:19 [Speaker Changed] They, they talk about like delivery apps, they talk about dating apps. They, they talk about Twitter and what happened with Twitter. And so I’ve really enjoyed that. And then I’ve been listening. I listen to a ton of audio books ’cause I, I’m on a, I bike a lot and so I’ll listen to a book on the bike and blood in the machine is really good. It’s talking. That 01:07:40 [Speaker Changed] Sounds so familiar. 01:07:41 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I can’t remember at the author’s name. 01:07:44 [Speaker Changed] So I’m gonna get to specific books. We’ll circle. Okay, sorry. Sorry. So hold on that for a second. Okay. So those are all podcasts. Any, any video, anything you watch on video? 01:07:54 [Speaker Changed] Like YouTube stuff, 01:07:56 [Speaker Changed] YouTube, Netflix, whatever. Oh, 01:07:58 [Speaker Changed] I don’t watch a ton of Netflix. I, I, I do listen to a lot of podcasts. And then on YouTube I’ve been listening to Eddie Burback. Have you heard of him? No. He’s kind of like a commentator YouTube guy. But he did this thing on AI recently. He did this funny video where he visited all the rainforest cafes in the country and he’s just a very good producer. And I really enjoy thinking 01:08:24 [Speaker Changed] About how many Rainforest cafes are there in the co There’s one like, didn’t that come out like 20 year, 25 years ago? Rainforest Cafe Wasn’t that Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwartz. And there, it wasn’t like a crazy collection. What I’m trying 01:08:36 [Speaker Changed] To like they teamed up. That? I’ve heard of that, yes. Yeah, Peter Kafka has done a couple of them, but like he, he Was at business week for a long time and then I think it was briefly at the Think. Yeah, I think so. I think that was his path. Or unless it was backwards times business week, but whatever. Yeah. Like He, he know. Yeah, he’s a, he’s a good economic writer And he’s a great podcaster. Oh really? Yeah. I really enjoyed his, his dives. 01:08:38 [Speaker Changed] So after Planet Hollywood I, I, I don’t remember, that’s why I’m getting that wrong. I know that they were involved, some people were involved in Planet Hollywood and a subset of those people did Rainforest Cafe. I could be completely wrong about that, 01:08:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know. But yeah, he, he, he walks, I don’t know, maybe it’s not every, 01:08:55 [Speaker Changed] Are there a lot of these left? 01:08:57 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, there are. Well at least one in every state. I think so. 01:09:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s good. Huh? That’s crazy. I’m gonna share a channel with you ’cause you brought up Mass Transit. Yeah. There is a guy, he’s a Canadian, he moved to Amsterdam and he has a channel called just not just Bikes. Just Bikes. Yeah. And I’m addicted to, first of all, I love Amsterdam. It just barely edged out. Paris is my favorite city. But the whole concept of hey, what you do with your mass transit affects everything from wealth and in income and inequality to quality of life and why people in countries with better mass transits have higher happiness quotient and better health outcomes. And yeah. It’s crazy how it just cascades. Yeah. After higher education, that seems to be the next most important thing. Do you 01:09:45 [Speaker Changed] Know that the average car in the United States has more space for itself than the average person does? Yeah, 01:09:51 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Yeah. Look, just look at all the plus to say nothing of the parking spots. Gosh. That, 01:09:56 [Speaker Changed] Have you read Pave Paradise? No. Oh, it’s about parking and it’s great. 01:10:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s get to your favorite books. No, let’s talk Pave Parking. Oh yeah. Pave Paradise. Pave Paradise About Parking. What else 01:10:07 [Speaker Changed] Do do you have? Yeah, it’s all about parking blood in the machine, which can, it’s this gorgeous book and he talks about the Luddites and he goes into deep detail and like talks about what it was like in obviously a very hard time, but what it looks like for their lives to be impacted by the introduction of like the spinning machine, right. And how AI is like, kind of comparing to that. And it’s just, it’s really good historical writing. And 01:10:30 [Speaker Changed] I, I just saw a research report this morning. I dunno who put it out. This is the problem with being a, a consumer of just too much junk. So much stuff that AI is gonna be a net positive. Oh, I know it was Torsten Slack looked at unemployment rates in Phil, the Philippines and somewhere else that a lot of, a lot of call centers and a lot of outsource stuff. And despite the introduction of ai, none of these places have seen an uptick in unemployment yet. Oh. Just kind of fascinating. Yeah. Like you would think that’s, that’s the canary in the coal mine. Right. 01:11:02 [Speaker Changed] And I think like the way that a lot of people are thinking about ai, not this author of Blood in the Machine, but as a compliment to the human laborer where it’s like that’s, it’s not something that places you, but something that, that enhances 01:11:13 [Speaker Changed] An augmentation. 01:11:14 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Yeah. I think I’ve, I’ve seen AI be an augmentation in my 01:11:17 [Speaker Changed] Life. A hundred percent. Yeah. Every time I do do the prep work for this, the last thing I do is, is enter into perplexity and chat GBT and see what comes up. It’s still is occasionally wrong. Yeah. I I you have to be very aware that it’s not trustworthy, but it’s getting a little better all the time. Yeah. And, and every now and then it’ll uncover a nugget that Yeah. We miss. And it’s, I have a research team. It’s not just me. And even still those deep dives will pull, pull stuff out. So Pave Paradise, blend the machine. Any other books you wanna 01:11:49 [Speaker Changed] Read? Oh gosh, yeah. I, I read a ton because I’m on the bike a lot, but I, I, I read this book about the founder of Glossier, which was really interesting. Or Glossier, I think it’s 01:11:59 [Speaker Changed] The water company. 01:12:00 [Speaker Changed] Glossier? It’s the makeup company. Oh, 01:12:02 [Speaker Changed] The makeup company? 01:12:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. So it’s about that, that founder and like what it was like for her to build a makeup company. And that was quite good. I read a lot of fiction. So right now 01:12:13 [Speaker Changed] Those first three are all nonfiction you just 01:12:15 [Speaker Changed] Gave me. Yeah. 01:12:17 [Speaker Changed] So give, all right, so that’s three nonfiction. Give us three fiction that you’re enjoying. 01:12:21 [Speaker Changed] I I’m reading a gentleman in Moscow right now. Have you read that? I 01:12:25 [Speaker Changed] Have it on my list forever. It’s always in my queue. I never get to it. It’s 01:12:28 [Speaker Changed] Like, so I’m, I’m probably a quarter of the way through it and it’s kind of a lot of dialogue, which I don’t always enjoy. Like I really love world building and fiction novels like Lord of the Rings, et 01:12:39 [Speaker Changed] Cetera. Are you a sci-fi or fantasy? I mean obviously Lord of the Rings is a classic, but it like 01:12:43 [Speaker Changed] Kind kind of, it’s more of, I like settings to be very clear so I can have it in my head as a visual. I don’t know if that makes sense. But 01:12:53 [Speaker Changed] CJ Shera was this and you could tell she was a woman ’cause it’s initials. ’cause when she was writing back in the sixties and seventies, you had to hide that. She has, if you like, world building, go check out Pride of Shamu. C-H-A-N-U-R. Okay. 01:13:08 [Speaker Changed] Pride of sha. 01:13:09 [Speaker Changed] If you’re like 20 pages into it and you’re not deeply in love, just throw it away. Okay. And you’re done. Yeah. But I may just have sent you down a rabbit hole that will 01:13:18 [Speaker Changed] Have a That’s all right. Yeah. 01:13:19 [Speaker Changed] And she’s just this amazing builder of worlds. That’s wonderful. That, that very few writers, like I just remember of all the sci-fi stuff I went through as a kid. Yeah. She just Totally, alright, so, so gentleman in Moscow, give us two more. 01:13:37 [Speaker Changed] I’m reading, I read Olive by, I can’t remember her name, but it, it got turned into a TV show. But it’s kind of really interesting because it’s about, and she has a sequel too called Olive Again. And it’s about this woman who just lives in this little town and she has all these little stories that surround this woman and all the stories interweave really beautifully. And I really like that kind of like time bending stuff. 01:13:59 [Speaker Changed] Elizabeth Strout Elizabeth, 01:14:01 [Speaker Changed] Thank you. Right. And then I, 01:14:03 [Speaker Changed] Google makes the universe of information. We, we don’t know anything but we’re knowledge adjacent. Yeah. Yeah. And there it is. 01:14:10 [Speaker Changed] Let me Google that. 01:14:10 [Speaker Changed] Oh wait, olive, olive again. She has too Emma Gannon or Ala or Elizabeth Strout. Those are, 01:14:18 [Speaker Changed] It’s Elizabeth Strout. 01:14:19 [Speaker Changed] Okay. Yeah. There’s another book called Olive by Emma Gannon. 01:14:23 [Speaker Changed] No, 01:14:23 [Speaker Changed] It’s from 2021. No, 01:14:25 [Speaker Changed] It’s Strout. Okay. 01:14:26 Yeah. And then I read Trust by Hernand Diaz. Have you read that? No. Oh, you should. It’s, it’s all about what this guy, it’s, I think it’s a fabrication, but it’s this guy that lived during the Great Depression and it’s actually three stories interwoven into one. And so you get the, like the fictionalized version of this guy’s life and then that guy becomes the second part of the book and we get to hear his actual story. Not one that’s like fabricated by this author. And then you get another part of the book that goes a little bit deeper into his wife’s life. Oh really? And so it’s, it’s really, it’s, I think I won Pulitzer. It’s, it’s quite, 01:15:04 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I’m looking at it right now. Yeah. Gold surprise winner. Yeah. 01:15:06 [Speaker Changed] I, I love when authors are like 01:15:09 [Speaker Changed] 20, 23. That was last year. Yeah. 01:15:11 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s really 01:15:12 [Speaker Changed] Good. I don’t understand. The hardcover and the paperback are now the same price. Oh really? This is a new 01:15:17 [Speaker Changed] Books are tough, tough 01:15:19 [Speaker Changed] Industry. I guess one of the New York Times a hundred best books of the 21st century. Yeah. 01:15:24 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s quite good. 01:15:25 [Speaker Changed] As long as they’ve read every book in the 21st century so they can make an informed evaluation like that. It’s a big claim. I’m down with that. Yeah, I know. It’s again, more stupid media stuff for the modern era. So that’s a great list of books right there. Yeah. I skipped the question to get to books that I have to ask you. Sure. But I’m, I’m not sure if you’re gonna have a good answer, which is, oh, who were your mentors who helped shape your career? 01:15:52 [Speaker Changed] Oh, because what I said about the mentor 01:15:53 [Speaker Changed] Thing. Well I know Jim O’Shaughnessy is obviously a big influence 01:15:57 [Speaker Changed] Give, oh gosh. I’ve had so many people, like I could, we’d be here all day if I listed everybody. 01:16:01 [Speaker Changed] Give us, give us one or two. So 01:16:02 [Speaker Changed] The two people that have probably been the most influential because they believed in me before I did, was my two professors in college, Dr. Chachi and Dr. Lebinski. I basically would go to them and be like, I wanna start a club. I wanna do research around the s and p 500. I wanna, you know, go travel to this conference. And they’d be like, alright, good. And they would just help me kind of achieve all of these dreams that I had. Huh. And so they were phenomenal. Like I remember I was applying to jobs and I wanted to do a PhD ’cause I really wanted to teach. And Dr. Chachi was like, no, you should go work in in industry for a little bit and then you can go and get your PhD. And so it was just kind of like that really tailored advice and support. And they were probably the most important people to me during my college time. 01:16:47 [Speaker Changed] You know that, that’s really interesting. Angus Deaton, who is the British economist who won the Nobel Prize and I think he’s teaching, is he teaching at Princeton? Yeah. He is teaching at Princeton. And he said you could look across a thousand different factors and nothing impacts your life as much as a higher education. Yeah. We, we see it in wealth inequality, income inequality, health outcomes, whether you go to jail, whether you get divorced, like all these social things that you would think are unrelated. Your, your self-described happiness quotient, like deep, deep down the rabbit hole. And consistently there is a, a gap between, between what we see on the have a ho college education and don’t, it’s pretty amazing. Well, 01:17:36 [Speaker Changed] I mean it’s kind of four, like I worked three jobs during college, but like, it’s, it’s four years to sort of figure yourself out. And I actually think that’s really important. ’cause you learn how to socialize, you learn how to learn, you get tested. But in an environment where like if you fail, it’s okay most of the time. Like if you fail out of college, it’s not okay, but you kind of have the chance to make safe mistakes is what I would call it. And I Is 01:18:01 [Speaker Changed] That still true today with with Oh, I don’t, it seems like some of the campuses, some of that has kind of become more challenging. Well, every 01:18:07 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. From a political angle. Absolutely. Yeah. And I think 01:18:12 [Speaker Changed] Too the cost, but it should, but what you are describing should be true. It should be a place where you can make mistakes. 01:18:17 [Speaker Changed] I think so I graduated in 2019 and I think I was the last year to have that. I, I do because of the pandemic and because I, I just like, I, the scholarship package that I got and the reason that I went to Western Kentucky, it was a full ride and I was paid to go to school and there’s nothing like that. Sure. Unless you’re like a top, top, top student. And I was a good student, but it was an in-state school. And so I had all these opportunities because I was able to have a full ride. Right. And I, I just don’t think that’s, 01:18:48 [Speaker Changed] Where else did you consider going besides in-State? Oh, 01:18:51 [Speaker Changed] Well, Vanderbilt, I wanted to stay close to my family. So Vanderbilt’s, which was in Tennessee, I was in Kentucky. I was looking at Butler up in Indiana, Notre Dame. Yeah. Like just kind of 01:19:00 [Speaker Changed] Big schools, little schools both. Yeah. You looked at everything. Yeah. 01:19:04 [Speaker Changed] I wanted like a, a good school. Right. Because I, I did wanna 01:19:07 [Speaker Changed] Leave Kentucky. Well, none of these are bad schools. You’re talking about all good or better schools. 01:19:11 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Yeah. But like, I wanted to leave Kentucky and the only way I knew how to get out was like through education. And so that’s why I was looking at the schools. But I ended up staying in Western Kentucky because the scholarship and it turned out to be an incredible experience. Huh. 01:19:26 [Speaker Changed] To say, to say the very least. And our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either finance or investing education? 01:19:39 [Speaker Changed] So I think for me, and this is the advice I give when people ask, is like to read everything and to figure out what you like to read and then try to challenge yourself to explain it, to write about it, to learn about it as deeply as you can. And I think the only way that you actually understand stuff is if you can explain it simply. And so that’s what I’d recommend is just be a consumer ask questions. You’d be surprised how many people are willing to just take 30 minutes to chat with you and just ask for help as much as you can. But yeah, just absorb as much as possible, but then make sure you’re digesting it by repeating it back to yourself, whether through writing videos, et cetera. 01:20:15 [Speaker Changed] And, and our final question comes with a little bit of a caveat. So I always share the last five questions, partly because they require a little recall with our guests in advance. And I asked you, what do you know about the world of investing today that you wish you knew 25 years ago and you hilariously wrote back 25 years ago? I was one. Don’t bite the cat. I mean, I think that’s so funny. I don’t know if you said that or Dave Ick said that in our, our back and forth. I shared your answer with him and he think, I think he said, don’t bite the cat. Yeah, yeah. But what do you know today that might’ve been helpful earlier in your career? 01:20:55 [Speaker Changed] I, I think for me, there’s so many facets to finance. Like I was very much like, oh, there’s one thing I can do and it’s portfolio management, but there’s so much that you can do education, you can look into IRA space as you all do. You can do media. Like there’s just, and there’s so many different worlds within finance, commodities, fixed income, equities. It’s really massive. And so I think the advice that I would give to my 1-year-old self is to, you know, just keep on learning. And similar to the advice I gave previous, but really just know that the world is so big and there’s so much opportunity within these segments that are just fascinating to explore. You can spend a lifetime doing it. 01:21:32 [Speaker Changed] Well, thank you Kyla, for being so generous with your time. Yeah. I’m gonna have to have you sign this form me. Oh, 01:21:36 [Speaker Changed] Thank you. 01:21:37 [Speaker Changed] We have been speaking with Kyla Scanlan. She’s the author of In This Economy, how Money and Markets Really Work.

October 05, 2024 06:37 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Oct. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

The battle over remote work continues — and it looks like chief executives are overwhelmingly willing to take extreme measures to get folks back to the office. A recent report from the global research and accounting firm KPMG shows that 89 percent of corporate CEOs at US companies are willing to dangle incentives like "favorable assignments, raises, and promotions" for employees who head back to the office full-time. As Inc and Axios point out, that overwhelming figure suggests that CEOs may also be willing to withhold those same benefits from employees who choose to stay home. In other words, folks who are willing or able to get back into the office will likely have a serious advantage over those who don't want to be back in the office — or, perhaps more importantly, can't due to location, health, or family reasons. It's a staggering figure, and one that comes at a tumultuous moment in the ongoing battle between remote or hybrid workforces and C-suite executives insisting that it's time for employees to get back to the office full-time — despite overwhelming evidence that remote work doesn't affect productivity. The KPMG report also found that 79 percent of CEOs expect that within three years, corporate roles ceded to remote setups during the pandemic will once again be in the office full-time. Per the report, just a few short months ago, only 34 percent of CEOs predicted a mass return-to-office shift. On that note, the report's findings come after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced last month that employees must return to the office for all five days a week, or otherwise risk being sacked. And while Jassy's decision might have some chief executives feeling inspired, it's worth noting that the decision was met with outrage from much of Amazon's workforce. Many of them have since looked for work elsewhere. "At first, I didn't quite believe it," one such Amazon employee, a mother who says she was hired with the understanding that there would be no full-time return-to-office mandate, recently told Fortune. "I've been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn." Some CEOs have admitted to using return-to-office mandates as a guise for layoffs, expecting the decision to lead to some degree of a voluntary exodus. Whether the executives' gambit to attract workers to come back to the office will pay off in the long run remains to be seen. If there's one certainty, it's that a mandate likely won't go over easy.

Title: After multiple layoffs, one entrepreneur went all-in on her pet portrait side hustle. She took a pay cut but has more freedom and isn't 'bound by meetings from 9-to-5.'

Emma Sadler was working in hospitality in early 2020 when the Covid pandemic first swept the nation. She immediately lost her job as a restaurant manager at the Danny Meyer-run MoMa in New York City. "That was when I sat with myself and was like, 'Okay, I think it's time to make a change. The food industry is going to go downhill,'" Sadler, who was 29 then and a single mom, told Business Insider. "My daughter was still relatively young and I'd missed out a lot on her life, and it was only going to get harder for me careerwise in the food and beverage industry. If I wanted to continue to move up, it would just be more hours and more time away from her." She decided to pivot into tech. It was a natural transition for Sadler, who had experience working on websites for the smaller food businesses she'd worked at. In 2021, she landed her first job as a UI/UX designer. She lasted in tech for nearly four years. "I unfortunately did get laid off in 2022 from the company I was working at and then I got laid off in 2024 again. I realized that kind of a similar thing was happening in tech that had previously happened with the food industry during Covid," said Sadler. After the second tech layoff in 2024, Sadler reevaluated her situation, much like she did in 2020, and felt like it was as good a time as any to go all-in on her side hustle: making custom pet portraits and accessories like keychains and pet tags, which she'd been doing since 2023. The side project served two purposes: It provided extra income that she could draw on if she lost her job and provided a creative outlet for someone who grew up making art. "Tech is very screen heavy. It's a different type of creativity, and I've always been a very tactile artist," she said. "I really wanted another outlet where I could make something physical and not just something digital." She settled on custom pet accessories because it was something she personally wanted but couldn't easily find. "A lot of what's out there for keychains or magnets or portraits are all based around designs because they're more scalable," said Sadler. "But I had mutts. They're unique. They have their own personalities. And so that's kind of how it started: I want a keychain of my dog, but none of these really look like my dog." To test whether other people also wanted custom pet portraits and accessories, Sadler applied for a pop-up event in Brooklyn so she could interact with customers and get feedback. She continued doing in-person events around New York and started profiting after the 2023 holiday season, which confirmed that she was onto something. By the time she was let go from her day job in early 2024, "I was like, it's now or never. I have these skills, I've been building this business, people are interested, I really enjoy this personally as a creative. I have this opportunity where I can go ahead and bet on myself and see what happens," recalled Sadler. In a worst-case scenario, "it's not as successful, and I have to fall back on being a bartender or pouring myself back into the job market search." In the six months since committing to her small business, Taleology, Sadler has earned more than she anticipated. "I definitely didn't think I would be making five figures in my first year," she said. BI confirmed her five-figure revenue by looking at her Shopify dashboard. With so much more time to dedicate to the business, she was able to focus on growing her online presence in addition to the pop-up events. TikTok Live, in particular, helped bring in new customers. "I had a spike of growth thanks to TikTok, but I think now my steady growth is coming from word of mouth and from people genuinely caring about the uniqueness of the craft that I offer, as well as the seamless experience that I provide," said Sadler, whose typical turnaround time is one week from when a customer places an order. "I know I'm not Amazon and I never will be Amazon, but I do know that there's a lot of small businesses that can take a very, very long time, especially for something that's custom." Her monthly income hasn't come close to surpassing what she was earning in tech, and she does some freelance work as an email marketing designer and presentation designer, she noted: "Do I think it could eventually one day get to pay my salary? Yes. But as of right now, in the first year, it's definitely not comparable with that, which is why I do have some part-time jobs to help supplement because I do want to put as much of it back into the business. I don't want to really pay myself right now if I can avoid it." In the meantime, she has peace of mind knowing that her earnings are broadly in her control. She expects fluctuations — the end-of-year holiday season is much busier than January and February, for example — but she doesn't have to worry about layoffs and her income abruptly halting. "Building something that's your own definitely comes with a certain level of contentment — knowing that it's something, to a degree, that you control," she said. Her day-to-day as an entrepreneur looks a lot different than it did as a corporate employee, and she prefers it: "The main difference is the freedom. You're making your own schedule. I'm not bound by the meetings from 9-to-5 that I have to attend. I get to structure my day how I want." That said, there are tasks she has to do as a one-woman operation like social media and admin that, for her, are "not really that fun," she noted. "But creating and getting to communicate with customers brings me so much fulfillment that it shadows all the other stuff that I have to do as a business owner." Jump to

With hardly anyone noticing, a tech titan you’ve probably never heard of has booted Tesla out of the heavily hyped Magnificent Seven. Can it stay there? The overlooked Magnificent Seventh is Broadcom, a tech company that produces both hardware and software. It’s well-known in the infotech world but unfamiliar beyond it. The Magnificent Seven, conceived as a group of stocks in early 2023, are the most valuable U.S. tech companies by market capitalization. In descending order they include Apple (recent market cap: $3.4 trillion), Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla (recent market cap: $768 billion). Yet Broadcom’s market cap slipped past Tesla’s last spring and has stayed ahead of the EV maker for most of the year. Its market cap is currently around $803 billion. Broadcom is not guaranteed to stay ahead of Tesla, at least in the near term. Tesla’s stock is notoriously volatile, and its market cap could plausibly beat Broadcom’s for a time. But Broadcom’s long-term outlook is by far the sunnier of the two. Wall Street analysts on average expect its stock price to keep climbing, while they expect Tesla’s to continue to fall. Tesla’s stock has retreated to where it was almost four years ago, while Broadcom’s is up 290% since then. So how did this quiet giant sneak into the highest reaches of tech royalty? Mostly by a combination of tech savvy and financial acumen. The company is a grandchild of Hewlett-Packard, which in 1999 spun off a company called Agilent Technologies, which in turn spun off a company called Avago to a pair of private equity firms in 2005. Avago began buying up semiconductor companies, in 2015 buying a big one called Broadcom and taking its name. Broadcom’s PE ancestry has guided it ever since that spinoff. “Broadcom operates pretty much like a PE firm, where it invests in assets that can deliver quick returns,” says Naveen Chhabra, an analyst at the Forrester research and consulting firm. It’s “astute in terms of investing in firms where it can maintain or grow the revenue” and at the same time “can turn the company into a high margin business.” Exhibit A is Broadcom’s biggest acquisition, the cloud-computing firm VMware, which it bought last November. A Forrester report for VMware customers warns them, “Don’t let the price jumps shock you…In most cases, customers will find the renewal quotes multiple times higher than what they paid in the past.” Wall Street approves of Broadcom’s changes. “They appear to be killing it on VMware,” says Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, “which markedly exceeded expectations in the quarter and which seems poised to continue growing.” Shrewd acquisitions and management are central to Broadcom’s growth but don’t fully explain the company’s phenomenally swelling market cap. The other crucial factor is, not surprisingly, the AI frenzy. One of Broadcom’s most important businesses is designing semiconductors—computer chips—and in the past year, demand has been sky-high. Broadcom’s sales of AI chips in fiscal 2023 were $4.2 billion, BofA Securities reports. The company expects AI chip sales will rocket to $12.1 billion this year and $16.9 billion next year. Broadcom’s chip expertise along with VMware’s success has propelled Broadcom’s market cap from just above that of McDonald’s when OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, to Magnificent Seven levels today. A critical element of Broadcom’s success and its future is CEO Hock Tan, who was recruited to run the company when Avago was spun off in 2005. Now age 72, he was born in Malaysia and earned engineering degrees from MIT plus an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He has spent most of his career in tech companies, though he also held finance jobs at PepsiCo and General Motors—thus the company’s joint expertise in technology and finance. In recent years, Tan has been among the most highly paid U.S. CEOs; he made $162 million last year. Succession is an obvious issue for the company, but no successor is apparent. Tan has said he’ll continue to run the company for at least four more years. Wall Street analysts are mostly cheering for Broadcom. “Numbers look likely to keep going up,” says Bernstein’s Rasgon. “And valuation is looking increasingly attractive.” JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur says the stock “remains our top pick in semiconductors.” No tree grows to the sky, but for now the sun is shining brightly on this company. Beyond that, the only certainty is that Broadcom can’t be anonymous anymore. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

(NYSE: WGO), Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI), and Sun Communities (NYSE: SUI). Our investigations concern whether these companies have violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WGO) On September 23, 2024, Hunterbrook Media published an article called "‘Grand Deception"- Winnebago Muzzles Outcry Over Major Problem That Owners Say Makes RVs Dangerous, Untowable, Worthless." The article stated that Winnebago's "best-selling Grand Design RVs" appear to be "experiencing frame failure, potentially affecting thousands of units sold for more than a billion dollars. This defect has led to costly damage and potential safety hazards, and rendered some RVs unroadworthy." The article continued to state that "Winnebago has used NDAs, buybacks, and online censorship to silence complaints about frame failure[.]" Following this news, Winnebago's stock dropped $1.35 per share, or 2.28%, to close at $57.76 on September 23, 2024. For more information on the Winnebago investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/WGO Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) On September 24, 2024, during market hours, The United States Department of Justice issued a release entitled “Justice Department Sues Visa for Monopolizing Debit Markets.” In this release, the DOJ announced that it had “filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today against Visa for monopolization and other unlawful conduct in debit network markets[.]” The release further stated that the “complaint alleges that Visa illegally maintains a monopoly over debit network markets by using its dominance to thwart the growth of its existing competitors and prevent others from developing new and innovative alternatives.” The release quoted Attorney General Merrick Garland as stating that “[w]e allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market[.] Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service. As a result, Visa’s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing – but the price of nearly everything.” On this news, the price of Visa stock fell 5.4% on September 24, 2024. For more information on the Visa investigation go to: https://bespc.com/cases/V Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ: KSPI) On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims-especially ahead of the Company's January 2024 NASDAQ listing-that the Company has zero exposure to Russia", when in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." Following publication of the Culper Research report, Kaspi's American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") price fell $19.20 per ADR, or 16.13%, to close at $99.81 per ADR on September 19, 2024.

In this report, Blue Orca Capital stated that "Our diligence reveals that SUI’s CEO received an undisclosed $4 million loan from the family of a purportedly independent Director who has sat on the Audit Committee and chaired the Compensation Committee for close to a decade. Put simply, undisclosed to investors, the family of a Board member overseeing the CEO’s compensation and Company controls has been lending the CEO money to finance the purchase of luxury real estate. Stunningly, this is not the only undisclosed personal loan we uncovered from a SUI Board member to the CEO." Following the release of this report, a decrease in the Company's share price was observed during the early morning trading on the same day, September 25, 2024.
