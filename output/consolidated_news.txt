After publishing this piece, I was contacted by Anthropic who told me that Sonnet 3.7 would not be considered a 10^26 FLOP model and cost a few tens of millions of dollars to train, though future models will be much bigger. I updated the post with that information. The only significant change is that Claude 3 is now referred to as an advanced model but not a Gen3 model. I love Mollick’s work, but reject his neutral naming scheme: whoever gets to a generation first deserves the honor of the name. In other words, if Gen2 models are GPT-4 class, then Gen3 models are Grok 3 class. And, whereas Sonnet 3.7 is an evolution of Sonnet 3.5’s fascinating mixture of personality and coding prowess, likely a result of some Anthropic special sauce in post-training, Grok 3 feels like a model that is the result of a step-order increase in compute capacity, with a much lighter layer of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Its answers are far more in-depth and detailed (model good!), but frequently becomes too verbose (RLHF lacking); it gets math problems right (model good!), but its explanations are harder to follow (RLHF lacking). It is also much more willing to generate forbidden content, from erotica to bomb recipes, while having on the surface the political sensibilities of Tumblr, with something more akin to 4chan under the surface if you prod.1 Grok 3, more than any model yet, feels like the distilled Internet; it’s my favorite so far. Grok 3 is also a reminder of how much speed matters, and, by extension, why base models are still important in a world of AI’s that reason. Grok 3 is tangibly faster than the competition, which is a better user experience; more generally, conversation is the realm of quick wits, not deep thinkers. The latter is who I want doing research or other agentic-type tasks; the former makes for a better consumer user experience in a chatbot or voice interface. ChatGPT, meanwhile, still has the best product experience — its Mac app in particular is dramatically better than Claude’s2 — and it handles more consumer-y use cases like math homework in a much more user-friendly way. Deep Research, meanwhile, is significantly better than all of its competitors (including Grok’s “Deep Search”), and, for me anyways, the closest experience yet to AGI. OpenAI’s biggest asset, however, is the ChatGPT brand and associated mindshare; COO Brad Lightcap just told CNBC that the service had surpassed 400 million weekly active users, a 33% increase in less than 3 months. OpenAI is, as I declared four months after the release of ChatGPT, the accidental consumer tech company. Consumer tech companies are the hardest to build and have the potential to be the most valuable; they also require a completely different culture and value chain than a research organization with an API on the side. That is the fundamental reality that I suspect has driven much of the OpenAI upheaval over the last two-and-a-half years: long-time OpenAI employees didn’t sign up to be the next Google Search or Meta, nor is Microsoft interested in being a mere component supplier to a company that must own the consumer relationship to succeed. In fact, though, OpenAI has moved too slowly: the company should absolutely have an ad-supported version by now, no matter how much the very idea might make AI researchers’ skin crawl; one of the takeaways from the DeepSeek phenomenon was how many consumers didn’t understand how good OpenAI’s best models were because they were not paying customers. It is very much in OpenAI’s competitive interest to make it cost-effective to give free users the best models, and that means advertising. More importantly, the only way for a consumer tech company to truly scale to the entire world is by having an ad model, which maximizes the addressable market while still making it possible to continually increase the average revenue per user (this doesn’t foreclose a subscription model of course; indeed, ads + subscriptions is the ultimate destination for a consumer content business). DeepSeek, meanwhile, has both been the biggest story of the year, in part because it is the yin to Grok 3’s yang. DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 models are excellent and worthy competitors in the GPT-4 class, and they achieved this excellence through extremely impressive engineering on both the infrastructure and model layers; Grok 3, on the other hand, simply bought the most top-of-the-line Nvidia chips, leveraging the company’s networking to build the biggest computing cluster yet, and came out with a model that is better, but not astronomically so. The fact that DeepSeek is Chinese is critically important, for reasons I will get to below, but it is just as important that it is an open lab, regularly publishing papers, full model weights, and underlying source code. DeepSeek’s models — which are both better than Meta’s Llama models and more open (and unencumbered by an “openish” license) — set the bar for “minimum open capability”; any model at or below DeepSeek’s models has no real excuse to not be open. Safety concerns are moot when you can just run DeepSeek, while competitive concerns are dwarfed by the sacrifice in uptake and interest entailed in having a model that is both worse and closed. Both DeepSeek and Llama, meanwhile, provide significant pressure on pricing; API costs in both the U.S. and China have come down in response to the Chinese research lab’s releases, and the only way to have a sustainable margin in the long run is to either have a cost advantage in infrastructure (i.e. Google), have a sustainable model capability advantage (potentially Claude and coding), or be an Aggregator (which is what OpenAI ought to pursue with ChatGPT). All of this is — but for those with high p-doom concerns — great news. AI at the moment seems to be a goldilocks position: there is sufficient incentive for the leading research labs to raise money and continue investing in new foundation models (in the hope of building an AI that improves itself), even as competition drives API prices down relentlessly, further incentivizing model makers to come up with differentiated products and capabilities. The biggest winner, of course, continues to be Nvidia, whose chips are fabbed by TSMC: DeepSeek’s success is causing Chinese demand for the H20, Nvidia’s reduced-compute-and-reduced-bandwidth-to-abide-by-export-controls version of the H200, to skyrocket, even as xAI just demonstrated that the fastest way to compete is to pay for the best chips. DeepSeek’s innovations will make other models more efficient, but it’s reasonable to argue that those efficiences are downstream from the chip ban, and that it’s understandable why companies who can just buy the best chips haven’t pursued — but will certainly borrow! — similar gains. That latter point is a problem for AMD in particular: SemiAnalysis published a brutal breakdown late last year demonstrating just how poor the Nvidia competitor’s software is relative to its hardware; AMD promises to do better, but, frankly, great chips limited by poor software has been the story of AMD for its entire five decades of existence. Some companies, like Meta or Microsoft, might put in the work to write better software, but leading labs don’t have the time nor expertise. The story is different for Huawei and its Ascend line of AI chips. Those chips are fabbed on China’s Semiconductor Manufactoring International Corporation’s (SMIC) 7nm process, using western-built deep ultraviolet lighography (DUV) and quad-patterning; that this is possible isn’t a surprise, but it’s reasonable to assume that the fab won’t progress further without a Chinese supplier developing extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) (and no, calling an evolution of the 7nm process 5.5nm doesn’t count). Still, the primary limitation for AI chips — particularly when it comes to inference — isn’t necessarily chip speed, but rather memory bandwidth, and that can be improved at the current process level. Moreover, one way to (somewhat) overcome the necessity of using less efficient chips is to simply build more data centers with more power, something that China is much better at than the U.S. Most importantly, however, is that China’s tech companies have the motivation — and the software chops — to make the Ascend a viable contender, particularly for inference. There is one more player who should be mentioned alongside Nvidia/TSMC and Huawei/SMIC, and that is the hyperscalers who design their own chips, either on their own (AWS with Trainium and Microsoft with Maia) or in collaboration with Broadcom (Google with TPUs and Meta with MTIA). The capabilities and importance of these efforts varies — Google has been investing in TPUs for a decade now, and trains its own models on them, while the next-generation Anthropic model is being trained on Trainium; Meta’s MTIA is about recommendations and not generative AI, while Microsoft’s Maia is a much more nascent effort — but what they all have in common is that their chips are fabbed by TSMC. That TSMC is dominant isn’t necessarily a surprise. Yes, much has been written, including on this site, about Intel’s stumbles and TSMC’s rise, but even if Intel had managed to stay on the leading edge — and 18A is looking promising — there is still the matter of the company needing to transform itself from an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) who designs and makes its own chips, to a foundry that has the customer service, IP library, and experience to make chips for 3rd parties like all of the entities I just discussed. Nvidia, to take a pertinent example, was making its chips at TSMC (and Samsung) even when Intel had the leading process; indeed, it was the creation of TSMC and its pure-play foundry model that even made Nvidia possible.3 This also means that TSMC doesn’t just have leading edge capacity, but trailing edge capacity as well. There are a lot of chips in the world — both on AI servers and also in everything from cars to stereos to refrigerators — that don’t need to be on the cutting edge and which benefit from the low costs afforded by the fully depreciated foundries TSMC still maintains, mostly in Taiwan. And TSMC, in turn, can take that cash flow — along with increasing prices for the leading edge — and invest in new fabs on the cutting edge. Those leading edge fabs continue to skyrocket in price, which means volume is critical. That is why it was clear to me back when this site started in 2013 that Intel needed to become a foundry; unfortunately the company didn’t follow my advice, preferring to see their stock price soar on the back of cloud server demand. Fast forward to 2021 and Intel — now no longer on the leading edge, and with its cloud server business bleeding share to a resurgent AMD on TSMC’s superior process — tried, under the leadership of Pat Gelsinger, to become a foundry; unfortunately the company’s diminishing cash position is larger than its foundry customer base, which is mostly experimental chips or x86 variants. Intel’s core problem goes back to the observation above: becoming a foundry is about more than having the leading edge process; Intel might have been able to develop those skills in conjunction with customers eager to be on the best process in the world, but once Intel didn’t even have that, it had nothing to offer. There simply is no reason for an Apple or AMD or Nvidia to take the massive risk entailed in working with Intel when TSMC is an option. TSMC is, of course, headquartered in Taiwan; that is where the company’s R&D and leading edge fabs are located, along with most of its trailing edge capacity. SMIC, obviously, is in China; another foundry is Samsung, in South Korea. I told the story as to why so much of this industry ended up in Asia last fall in A Chance to Build: Semiconductors are so integral to the history of Silicon Valley that they give the region its name, and, more importantly, its culture: chips require huge amounts of up-front investment, but they have, relative to most other manufactured goods, minimal marginal costs; this economic reality helped drive the development of the venture capital model, which provided unencumbered startup capital to companies who could earn theoretically unlimited returns at scale. This model worked even better with software, which was perfectly replicable. That history starts in 1956, when William Shockley founded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to commercialize the transistor that he had helped invent at Bell Labs; he chose Mountain View to be close to his ailing mother. A year later the so-called “Traitorous Eight”, led by Robert Noyce, left and founded Fairchild Semiconductor down the road. Six years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened a facility in Hong Kong to assemble and test semiconductors. Assembly required manually attaching wires to a semiconductor chip, a labor-intensive and monotonous task that was difficult to do economically with American wages, which ran about $2.50/hour; Hong Kong wages were a tenth of that. Four years later Texas Instruments opened a facility in Taiwan, where wages were $0.19/hour; two years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened another facility in Singapore, where wages were $0.11/hour. In other words, you can make the case that the classic story of Silicon Valley isn’t completely honest. Chips did have marginal costs, but that marginal cost was, within single digit years of the founding of Silicon Valley, exported to Asia. I recounted in that Article about how this outsourcing was an intentional policy of the U.S. government, and launched into a broader discussion about the post-War Pax Americana global order that placed the U.S. consumer market at the center of global trade, denominated by the dollar, and why that led to an inevitable decline in American manufacturing and the rise of a country in China that, in retrospect, was simply too big, and thus too expensive, for America to bear. That, anyways, is how one might frame many of the signals coming out of the 2nd Trump administration, including what appears to be a Monroe 2.0 Doctrine approach to North America, an attempt to extricate the U.S. from the Ukraine conflict specifically and Europe broadly, and, well, a perhaps tamer approach to China to start, at least compared to Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail. One possibility is that Trump is actually following through on the “pivot to Asia” that U.S. Presidents have been talking about but failing to execute on for years; in this view the U.S. is girding itself up to defend Taiwan and other entities in Asia, and hopefully break up the burgeoning China-Russia relationship in the process. The other explanation is more depressing, but perhaps more realistic: President Trump may believe that the unipolar U.S.-dominated world that has been the norm since the fall of the Soviet Union is drawing to a close, and it’s better for the U.S. to proactively shift to a new norm than to have it forced upon them. The important takeaway that is relevant to this Article is that Taiwan is the flashpoint in both scenarios. A pivot to Asia is about gearing up to defend Taiwan from a potential Chinese invasion or embargo; a retrenchment to the Americas is about potentially granting — or acknowledging — China as the hegemon of Asia, which would inevitably lead to Taiwan’s envelopment by China. This is, needless to say, a discussion where I tread gingerly, not least because I have lived in Taipei off and on for over two decades. And, of course, there is the moral component entailed in Taiwan being a vibrant democracy with a population that has no interest in reunification with China. To that end, the status quo has been simultaneously absurd and yet surprisingly sustainable: Taiwan is an independent country in nearly every respect, with its own border, military, currency, passports, and — pertinent to tech — economy, increasingly dominated by TSMC; at the same time, Taiwan has not declared independence, and the official position of the United States is to acknowledge that China believes Taiwan is theirs, without endorsing either that position or Taiwanese independence. Chinese and Taiwanese do, in my experience, handle this sort of ambiguity much more easily than do Americans; still, gray zones only go so far. What has been just as important are realist factors like military strength (once in favor of Taiwan, now decidedly in favor of China), economic ties (extremely deep between Taiwan and China, and China and the U.S.), and war-waging credibility. Here the Ukraine conflict and the resultant China-Russia relationship looms large, thanks to the sharing of military technology and overland supply chains for oil and food that have resulted, even as the U.S. has depleted itself. That, by extension, gets at another changing factor: the hollowing out of American manufacturing under Pax Americana has been directly correlated with China’s dominance of the business of making things, the most essential war-fighting capability. Still, there is — or rather was — a critical factor that might give China pause: the importance of TSMC. Chips undergird every aspect of the modern economy; the rise of AI, and the promise of the massive gains that might result, only make this need even more pressing. And, as long as China needs TSMC chips, they have a powerful incentive to leave Taiwan alone. Anyone who has been following the news for the last few years, however, can surely see the problem: the various iterations of the chip ban, going back to the initial action against ZTE in 2018, have the perhaps-unintended effect of making China less dependent on TSMC. I wrote at the time of the ZTE ban: What seems likely to happen in the long run is a separation at the hardware layer as well; China is already investing heavily in chips, and this action will certainly spur the country to focus on the sort of relatively low-volume high-precision components that other countries like the U.S., Taiwan, and Japan specialize in (to date it has always made more sense for Chinese companies to focus on higher-volume lower-precision components). To catch up will certainly take time, but if this action harms ZTE as much as it seems it will I suspect the commitment will be even more significant than it already is. I added two years later, after President Trump barred Huawei from TSMC chips in 2020: I am, needless to say, not going to get into the finer details of the relationship between China and Taiwan (and the United States, which plays a prominent role); it is less that reasonable people may disagree and more that expecting reasonableness is probably naive. It is sufficient to note that should the United States and China ever actually go to war, it would likely be because of Taiwan. In this TSMC specifically, and the Taiwan manufacturing base generally, are a significant deterrent: both China and the U.S. need access to the best chip maker in the world, along with a host of other high-precision pieces of the global electronics supply chain. That means that a hot war, which would almost certainly result in some amount of destruction to these capabilities, would be devastating…one of the risks of cutting China off from TSMC is that the deterrent value of TSMC’s operations is diminished. Now you can see the fly in Goldilocks’ porridge! China would certainly like the best chips from TSMC, but they are figuring out how to manage with SMIC and the Ascend and surprisingly efficient state-of-the-art models; the entire AI economy in the U.S., on the other hand — the one that is developing so nicely, with private funding pursuing the frontier, and competition and innovation up-and-down the stack — is completely dependent on TSMC and Taiwan. We have created a situation where China is less dependent on Taiwan, even while we are more dependent on the island. This is the necessary context for two more will-he-or-won’t-he ideas floated by President Trump; both are summarized in this Foreign Policy article: U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to impose tariffs on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry and has previously accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry…The primary strategic goal for the administration is to revitalize advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States…As the negotiations between TSMC and the White House unfold, several options are emerging. The most discussed option is a deal between TSMC, Intel, the U.S. government, and U.S. chip designers such as Broadcom and Qualcomm. Multiple reports indicate that the White House has proposed a deal that would have TSMC acquire a stake in Intel Foundry Services and take a leading role in its operations after IFS separated from Intel. Other reports suggest a potential joint venture involving TSMC, Intel, the U.S. government, and industry partners, with technology transfer and technical support from TSMC. The motivation for such a proposal is clear: Intel’s board, who fired Gelsinger late last year, seems to want out of the foundry business, and Broadcom or Qualcomm are natural landing places for the design division; the U.S., however, is the entity that needs a leading edge foundry in the U.S., and the Trump administration is trying to compel TSMC to make it happen. Unfortunately, I don’t think this plan is a good one. It’s simply not possible for one foundry to “take over” another: while the final output is the same — a microprocessor — nearly every step of the process is different in a multitude of ways. Transistors — even ones of the same class — can have different dimensions, with different layouts (TSMC, for example, packs its transistors more densely); production lines can be organized differently, to serve different approaches to lithography; chemicals are tuned to individual processes, and can’t be shared; equipment is tailored to a specific line, and can’t be switched out; materials can differ, throughout the chip, along with how exactly they are prepared and applied. Sure, most of the equipment could be repurposed, but one doesn’t simply layer a TSMC process onto an Intel fab! The best you could hope for is that TSMC could rebuild the fabs using the existing equipment according to their specifications. That, though, doesn’t actually solve the Taiwan problem: TSMC is still headquartered in Taiwan, still has its R&D division there, and is still beholden to a Taiwanese government directive to not export its most cutting edge processes (and yes, there is truth to Trump’s complaints that Taiwan sees TSMC as leverage to guarantee that the U.S. defends Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion). Moreover, the U.S. chip problem isn’t just about the leading edge, but also the trailing edge. I wrote in Chips and China: It’s worth pointing out, though, that this is producing a new kind of liability for the U.S., and potentially more danger for Taiwan…these aren’t difficult chips to make, but that is precisely why it makes little sense to build new trailing edge foundries in the U.S.: Taiwan already has it covered (with the largest marketshare in both categories), and China has the motivation to build more just so it can learn. What, though, if TSMC were taken off the board? Much of the discussion around a potential invasion of Taiwan — which would destroy TSMC (foundries don’t do well in wars) — centers around TSMC’s lead in high end chips. That lead is real, but Intel, for all of its struggles, is only a few years behind. That is a meaningful difference in terms of the processors used in smartphones, high performance computing, and AI, but the U.S. is still in the game. What would be much more difficult to replace are, paradoxically, trailing node chips, made in fabs that Intel long ago abandoned… The more that China builds up its chip capabilities — even if that is only at trailing nodes — the more motivation there is to make TSMC a target, not only to deny the U.S. its advanced capabilities, but also the basic chips that are more integral to everyday life than we ever realized. It’s good that the administration is focused on the issue of TSMC and Taiwan: what I’m not sure anyone realizes is just how deep the dependency goes, and just how vulnerable the U.S. — and our future in AI — really is. Everything that I’ve written until now has been, in some respects, trivial: it’s easy to identify problems and criticize proposed solutions; it’s much more difficult to come up with solutions of one’s own. The problem is less the need for creative thinking and more the courage to make trade-offs: the fact of the matter is that there are no good solutions to the situation the U.S. has got itself into with regards to Taiwan and chips. That is a long-winded way to say that the following proposal includes several ideas that, in isolation, I find some combination of distasteful, against my principles, and even downright dangerous. So here goes. The first thing the U.S. should do — and, by all means, make this a negotiating plank in a broader agreement with China — is let Chinese companies, including Huawei, make chips at TSMC, and further, let Chinese companies buy top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. The Huawei one is straightforward: Huawei’s founder may have told Chinese President Xi Jinping that Huawei doesn’t need external chip makers, but I think that the reality of having access to cutting edge TSMC fabrication would show that the company’s revealed preference would be for better chips than Huawei can get from SMIC — and the delta is only going to grow. Sure, Huawei would still work with SMIC, but the volume would go down; critically, so would the urgency of having no other choice. This, by extension, would restart China’s dependency on TSMC, thereby increasing the cost of making a move on Taiwan. At the same time, giving Huawei access to cutting edge chips would be a significant threat to Nvidia’s dominance; the reason the company is so up-in-arms about the chip ban isn’t simply foregone revenue but the forced development of an alternative to their CUDA ecosystem. The best way to neuter that challenge — and it is in the U.S.’s interest to have Nvidia in control, not Huawei — is to give companies like Bytedance, Alibaba, and DeepSeek the opportunity to buy the best. This does, without question, unleash China in terms of AI; preventing that has been the entire point of the various flavors of chip bans that came down from the Biden administration. DeepSeek’s success, however, should force a re-evaluation about just how viable it is to completely cut China off from AI. It’s also worth noting that success in stopping China’s AI efforts has its own risks: another reason why China has held off from moving against Taiwan is the knowledge that every year they wait increases their relative advantages in all the real world realities I listed above; that makes it more prudent to wait. The prospect of the U.S. developing the sort of AI that matters in a military context, however, even as China is cut off, changes that calculus: now the prudent course is to move sooner rather than later, particularly if the U.S. is dependent on Taiwan for the chips that make that AI possible. While I’ve continually made references to “chip bans”, that’s actually incomplete: the U.S. has also made moves to limit China’s access to semiconductor equipment necessary for making leading edge chips (SMIC’s 7nm process, for example, is almost completely dependent on western semiconductor equipment). Unfortunately, this effort has mostly been a failure, thanks to generous loopholes that are downstream from China being a large market for U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturers. It’s time for those loopholes to go away; remember, the overriding goal is for China to increase its dependence on Taiwan, and that means cutting SMIC and China’s other foundries off at the knees. Yes, this increases the risk that China will develop its own alternatives to western semiconductor manufacturers, leading to long-term competition and diminished money for R&D, but this is a time for hard choices and increasing Taiwan’s importance to China is more important. The U.S.’s dependency on TSMC for trailing edge chip capacity remains a massive problem; if you think the COVID chip shortages were bad, then a scenario where the U.S. is stuck with GlobalFoundries and no one else is a disaster so great it is hard to contemplate. However, as long as TSMC exists, there is zero economic rationale for anyone to build more trailing edge fabs. This, then, is a textbook example of where government subsidies are the answer: there is a national security need for trailing edge capacity, and no economic incentive to build it. And, as an added bonus, this helps fill in some of the revenue for semiconductor manufacturers who are now fully cut off from China. TSMC takes a blow, of course, but they are also being buttressed by orders from Huawei and other Chinese chip makers. That leaves Intel and the need for native leading edge capacity, and this is in some respects the hardest problem to solve. First, the U.S. should engineer a spin-off of Intel’s x86 chip business to Broadcom or Qualcomm at a nominal price; the real cost for the recipient company will be guaranteed orders for not just Intel chips but also a large portion of their existing chips for Intel Foundry. This will provide the foundational customer to get Intel Foundry off the ground. Second, the U.S. should offer to subsidize Nvidia chips made at Intel Foundry. Yes, this is an offer worth billions of dollars, but it is the shortest, fastest route to ground the U.S. AI industry in U.S. fabs. Third, if Nvidia declines — and they probably will, given the risks entailed in a foundry change — then the U.S. should make a massive order for Intel Gaudi AI accelerators, build data centers to house them, and make them freely available to companies and startups who want to build their own AI models, with the caveat that everything is open source. Fourth, the U.S. should heavily subsidize chip startups to build at Intel Foundry, with the caveat that all of the resultant IP that is developed to actually build chips — the basic building blocks, that are separate from the “secret sauce” of the chip itself — is open-sourced. Fifth, the U.S. should indemnify every model created on U.S.-manufactured chips against any copyright violations, with the caveat that the data used to train the model must be made freely available. Here is the future state the U.S. wants to get to: a strong AI industry running on U.S.-made chips, along with trailing edge capacity that is beyond the reaches of China. Getting there, however, will take significant interventions into the market to undo the overwhelming incentives for U.S. companies to simply rely on TSMC; even then, such a shift will take time, which is why making Taiwan indispensable to China’s technology industry is the price that needs to be paid in the meantime. AI is in an exciting place; it’s also a very precarious one. I believe this plan, with all of the risks and sacrifices it entails, is the best way to ensure that all of the trees that are sprouting have time to actually take root and change the world. I wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update. This suggests a surprising takeaway: it’s possible that while RLHF on ChatGPT and especially Claude block off the 4chan elements, they also tamp down the Tumblr elements, which is to say the politics don’t come from the post-training, but from the dataset — i.e. the Internet. In other words, if I’m right about Grok 3 having a much lighter layer of RLHF, then that explains both the surface politics, and what is available under the surface. ↩ Grok doesn’t yet have a Mac app, but its iPhone app is very good ↩ Although Nvidia’s first chip was made by SGS-Thomson Microelectronics ↩ Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) stock is crashing like a ‘soufflé under a sledge hammer’ as Elon Musk predicted
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/02/25/tesla-tsla-stock-is-crashing-like-a-souffle-under-a-sledge-hammer-as-elon-musk-predicted/
Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:52:24Z
Full Content:
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is crashing by as much as 8% today. CEO Elon Musk predicted that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth, which is what is happening now. As we reported earlier this month, if Tesla stock doesn’t crash this quarter, Tesla will likely be trading at a 500+ P/E after reporting Q1 2025 earnings. The last time Tesla traded at these levels, Musk warned Tesla employees that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth. It looks like the market is finally catching up as Tesla’s stock crashed 8% today: The automaker’s valuation has now dipped back below $1 trillion. Some media are linking the crash to Tesla’s sales in Europe, but it has been clear for weeks that sales are down roughly 50% in the market so far. On the positive side, Tesla launched a new FSD update in China today. The automaker will likely use that to justify the recognition of some deferred revenue, but it’s not all positive, as the update has been received with mixed reviews. I think the main factor impacting Tesla’s stock is the anticipation of reduced earnings expectations. Even with today’s 8% crash, Tesla’s stock is still trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 150, and that’s with the Bitcoin gain last quarter. If Tesla doesn’t crash more this quarter, with expected reduced earnings in Q1 due to much lower deliveries, it would likely shoot back up to a P/E of 300+. In comparison, an automaker like Toyota trades at a P/E of 7, and a technology company like Meta trades at a P/E of 40. These insane price-to-earnings ratios basically never hold, but they certainly don’t hold when earnings are going down, which is what is happening with Tesla: So many assumptions are being made that Tesla will win self driving, robotaxis, and personal robots. The truth of the matter is that Tesla is behind on all of these. With BYD throwing in full self driving on all cars, the premium for this has just dropped to near zero. Tesla unit sales, revenue and profits all accelerating downward, only hype is keeping the share price high. >60% of Tesla stock is held by institutions, so the fiduciaries at these places need to do their job and reduce exposure. If that happens price will crash. As you can see from this chart, the stock seems to only be starting to realize that it’s disconnected from its earnings, and it still has quite a bit of catching up to do. I never thought I’d find myself cheering for Tesla’s stock to continue crashing, but I feel like it’s the only way to save the company now, as the board and shareholders don’t care about anything else. Tesla’s stock crashing is the only way to get them to care about removing Elon Musk. I expect the stock to continue to crash in the coming weeks as analysts adjust their delivery expectations and then their earnings expectations for Q1. The consensus appear to still be over 400,000 deliveries in Q1, but it looks like it could be below that. Shareholders are hoping that Tesla’s planned launch of a robotaxi fleet in Austin in June will turn things around for the stock, but as I previously reported, that’s a “moving of the goal post” strategy by Elon – although it’s likely that large parts of the market don’t realize it.

The Nasdaq Composite index fell almost 1.4% on Tuesday after February consumer confidence missed expectations, coming in at 98.3 compared with the consensus of 103.0, and down from 105.3 in January — the worst decline since August. U.S. government debt rallied and the dollar weakened. The Nasdaq fell about 260 points. The S&P 500 dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by about 160 points . Money markets are now fully pricing a more than two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, Bloomberg News reports, even after 12-month average inflation expectations surged to 6% from 5.2%, partly driven by concern about tariffs. The Magnificent 7 shares declined more than 2% as a group. Nvidia (NVDA+4.94%) and Super Micro (SMCI+18.45%) shares fell in New York trading on a report — following declines in Japanese chipmakers including Tokyo Electron in Tokyo — that the U.S. is seeking tighter chip restrictions on China. Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy (MSTR+3.45%), plunged 11%, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $88,000, with other cryptocurrencies pacing the decline. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token. Chegg (CHGG-0.47%) stock fell 33% after the online learning platform filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively affected its traffic and revenue. Home Depot (HD+0.85%) rose 2.8% after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year. Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Hims & Hers (HIMS+8.05%) stock dove 22% even after the millennial-focused telehealth company reported soaring sales for 2024 last night.

Title: Civil service staff resigns over Musk's cuts
URL: https://www.wmur.com/article/civil-service-resignation-musk-government-efficiency/63917286
Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:37:41Z
Full Content:
More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE's government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. "We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services," they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. "This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer named Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. "I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans," Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.

Title: Nvidia earnings have analysts optimistic the DeepSeek selloff was just a blip
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-fiscal-q4-earnings-analysts-deepseek-ai-chips-1851766311
Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:30:00Z

As Nvidia (NVDA+4.94%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.68%). “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet,” Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek’s AI models — which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+3.81%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less — brought Big Tech’s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN+1.97%), Meta, and Microsoft. While investors waited to see if the tech giants “would lower their bold data center capex projections,” spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. “This is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,” Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making “a three to five-year bet when their infrastructure” will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, “that doesn’t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,” John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While “DeepSeek didn’t introduce anything fundamentally new” about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, “it did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.” However, DeepSeek’s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY+2.73%), Alibaba (BABA+4.88%), and ByteDance are “significantly” increasing orders of Nvidia’s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which “has been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.” Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+2.19%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. “I think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,” Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. “However, we’ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia’s guidance should further confirm that.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Sticky Inflation Means Gold Will Keep Rising

Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:24:55Z
Full Content:
By Byron King PostedFebruary 25, 2025 How much gold do you own? The correct answer is: “Not enough.” Don’t you wish you had some of these? This is a $20 gold coin from 1914, the first year of the Federal Reserve. And back then, just over 110 years ago, gold was $20 per ounce. U.S. $20 gold coin, St. Gaudens, minted 1914. Courtesy U.S. Treasury Dept. Today’s gold price is over $2,900, which means that the purchasing power of a dollar over the past century-plus has shrunk by a factor of 145x. In other words, a single dollar back in 1914 is the equivalent of $145 today. This is why people and institutions (certainly central banks) are buying gold. And it’s why gold deserves a place in every portfolio. Let’s dig into what’s happening with gold, what it means, and how to deal with it. On Jan. 20, 2025, when Donald Trump was inaugurated, an ounce of gold was quoted at $2,740. Now, a month into Trump’s second term, that same metal will set you back over $2,900, a rise of not quite 7% in just a few weeks. But don’t blame the rising gold price on Trump. Hey, after only a month in the Oval Office, this is not (yet) Trump’s economy. Many Biden administration legacies still cast shade, along with a long, deep history of federal-level misallocation of the nation’s economic power, if not the country’s money. Although yes, for sure, Trump or not, the price movement of gold foretells continuous inflation, so be prepared. The underlying problem is that inflation is embedded in the monetary system. It’s structural, or call it “sticky” inflation, to use an economic term made famous by no less than the Fed itself. And by many indicators, inflation is not going away any time soon. Looking back over just the past few years, inflation and gold prices have been rising. Here’s a chart to illustrate: Gold Price, past five years. Courtesy JM Bullion. As you can see, the price of gold began its recent, upward breakout in mid-2023 during the Biden administration. And gold has been on an uptrend ever since. So, by the beginning of this year the price of gold was already headed north. And we can only imagine how much higher the price of gold might be right now if Trump had not won the November election. Meanwhile, recall the inflation of the Biden era, aka “Bidenflation.” In truth, it was stagflation, meaning the mix of a stagnant economy and elevated inflation. Here’s a chart of those “sticky,” monthly price index moves over the past four years to remind you of what happened, courtesy of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Sticky price levels, five-year chart. Courtesy FRED. From 2021 onward, price levels went up consistently. Now, we’re living with all that cumulative inflation, a long-term hit to your purchasing power that exceeds 20% over the past four years. Stated another way, if you feel poorer, the chart above illustrates how your dollars don’t go as far at the grocery store. For the past four years, inflation shrank the value of what’s in your wallet and bank account. What’s worse is that official statistics tend to understate the reality of inflation. Government number adder-uppers often fudge towards the low end. Still, whatever numbers you follow, it’s clear that we’ve had inflation in the 3%–5% range for a while, and it feels like it when you buy a pound of bacon, or new tires, or get a quote to fix the roof. The U.S. economy finished 2024 with an official rate of inflation about 3.5%. Yet the Fed’s target goal for inflation has long been 2%, so it’s clearly not under control. There’s inflation momentum out there, with more hits yet to come. Again, keep in mind that all these inflation numbers are before Trump has submitted his first budget proposal. In fact, the federal government is running on last year’s continuing resolution to spend-spend-spend. Trump has nothing to do with it, although he and his new bestie Elon Musk are scouring the budget for items to cut and people to lay off. Trump doesn’t get a complete pass, however. Look back to the blowout federal spending in 2020 under Trump 1.0, during the first year of the pandemic. The President took some very bad advice, to be sure; but he was still the captain of the ship and went so far as to insist that U.S. Treasury checks bear his signature. So, Trump owns a chunk of past spending and current debt. But then in 2021, along came the Biden administration which opened the Treasury spigots even wider, and a flood of dollars spilled into a contracted economy. And that was the monetary kill-shot, some might say. Consider how, by 2021, unemployment was widespread and productivity was down. Likely, you recall shortages at every stage of supply chains, problems with just about everything. Remember the empty store shelves? How about the lack of toilet paper? The list is endless. Foolishly, Biden injected about two trillion dollars of vaporware Fed-bucks into this very contracted economy, which truly lit the flame of inflation. There was too much money chasing too few goods and services. Now, we have President Trump and his tenacious assistant Elon Musk, busily draining the federal swamp, ripping like a tornado through the massive federal bureaucracy in Washington. And hey, they’re getting things done! Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Courtesy Truth Social. Team Trump is on a roll, cutting budgets and closing down entire departments. This is exactly what Trump campaigned on, and he’s off to a fast start. However, the bulk of government spending is on relatively fixed expenses like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Yes, waste can be cut from these programs but there’s only so much which can realistically be cut. But let’s get back to gold, the price of which is controlled by events far beyond the powers of even the Mighty POTUS. The price of gold is set by supply and demand. As for availability, the supply of physical gold is metal above ground plus whatever new metal gets mined each year. Rising gold prices reflect the growth of money supply, an economic term for the amount of currency issued by central banks. The gold price mirrors inflation caused by central banks. Thus, it’s clear why wealthy people and deep-pocketed institutions, especially central banks, have been buying gold. They want to preserve wealth. Thus, demand is rising. Which brings us to the point that, for the past three years, many central banks have bought gold. No, the U.S. Fed wasn’t buying, sad to say. That hidebound institution disdains monetary gold. But over the past years, other central banks bought gold big time and are still in the market. For example, the central banks of Russia, China, India, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines and many more. In the words of the World Gold Council in 2024, “central banks continued to vacuum up gold at an eye-watering pace.” Kitco News explains that “central banks look to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.” Bones of contention with the dollar include a lack of confidence in the Fed’s interest rate manipulations, continuing inflation, and overall geopolitical instability. More and more, central banks are accumulating gold as a long-term store of value and inflation hedge. Gold is an effective portfolio diversifier with no default risk to physical holdings. Now, let’s get closer to home, meaning our portfolios. I believe it’s important to own gold in different forms: physical metal, ETFs, royalty companies, and gold miners. Physical speaks for itself. Store where you can find a safe site. This should be a multi-decade program for building generational wealth. You simply buy and hold and only spend when it’s truly necessary. Gold miners are also an attractive way to get exposure. And right now, I believe they’re cheap compared to bullion. You see, central banks are the primary buyers in today’s gold market, and they only buy bullion, not miners. There’s a big opportunity here we’ll be exploring further in the coming weeks. The entire precious metals sector is dramatically under-owned by investors today. Gold and silver investments account for less than 1% of global assets. The thinking appears to be, why buy a gold miner when you can buy soaring tech stocks? There is far too much money chasing overbought sectors like tech. If just a small amount of frothy market cap rotates into precious metal and mining shares, we’ll see massive upswings. The average investor has almost zero exposure to gold and silver, and that means prices have abundant upside potential. So no, it’s not too late to get into the gold space. Not even close.

Title: DOGE Staffers Resign After Being Asked To Dismantle ‘Critical Public Services’

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. ___ AP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.

The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation. “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,” Leavitt said. “President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.” The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on first- and fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. AP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston.

Title: ‘Depressing Bear Market’ Potentially About To Begin for Altcoins Amid Worrying Signs in Stock Market: Veteran Trader

A seasoned trader and analyst is warning that the future appears perilous for altcoins as the US stock market flashes worrying signs. The trader pseudonymously known as The Flow Horse tells his 9,120 Telegram subscribers that with the exception of Bitcoin (BTC), crypto assets could be at the “beginning of a depressing bear market.” According to the analyst, the pump-and dump-schemes linked to memecoins witnessed over the past few weeks are “massively overdone” and could mark the “jump the shark” moment for grifting in the crypto space. According to the trader, another reason that has made him bearish is the trend shift for some US tech stocks. “Palantir, Microstrategy, Walmart, Microsoft, Coinbase, Meta, Tesla, NVIDIA – some with trend shifts and some with reminiscences of parabolic blow-offs. The worrying thing is that Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) kind of called bullsh*t on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and this whole trend with artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures. This is not normally my area to dig into, but it’s worth remembering that a lot of the returns we are seeing in the market are in some way related to tech and AI arriving ‘better and faster’ than later. They have been a tailwind for everything, so I am concerned when those winds seem to shift at large and potentially all at once.” The Flow Horse also says that the efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce the federal workforce could impact the US unemployment rate negatively and this could have a ripple effect on the market. “The actions of Elon [Musk] and [US President Donald] Trump are also kind of sketchy, so I am wondering how that impacts job reports moving forward and how the market responds to that. All in all, there is a lot of weirdness in the air, and I think this kind of feeling usually precipitates a larger drop in stocks.” According to the pseudonymously named analyst, traders will be at an advantage going forward compared to the long-term holders of altcoins. “I see a ton of opportunities for traders, but a lot of pain for people that can not let go of this idea they had of up-only altcoin season ‘just getting started.'” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Nvidia Stock Down As View Could Hinge On Tariffs And DeepSeek

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang (C) arrives for Nvidia's end of year party in Taipei on ... [+] January 17, 2025. (Photo by CHENG Yu-chen / AFP) (Photo by CHENG YU-CHEN/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has fallen 8.4% so far in 2025. The biggest damage to the AI chip designer’s stock took place Monday, January 27 — a day after my Forbes post about DeepSeek’s R1, a complex reasoning model built for $5.7 million in three months. (The actual cost was $50 million or more – way below the $149 million spent to build Google’s Gemini, enterprise AI agent company Vectara’s CEO Amr Awadallah told CNBC). Since DeepSeek said the company used a lower-powered version of Nvidia’s GPUs, I wondered whether more large language model developers would follow DeepSeek’s lead and build models faster and more cheaply – possibly not buying as many of Nvidia’s latest, most expensive chips. The $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s stock market value that day did not deter retail investors. Instead, they have poured more than twice as much money — $5.7 billion — into Nvidia stock as of February 21 than last year, according to Vanda Research data featured by the Wall Street Journal. Will Nvidia bulls be rewarded after the company reports fiscal fourth quarter results? The answer depends on whether Nvidia beats and raises. More specifically, if Nvidia’s Q4 revenue and earnings grow faster than the FactSet consensus of 72% and 59%, respectively, and the company forecasts faster than expected growth and higher margins for the current quarter, Nvidia stock could soar. Wall Street will be focusing on whether Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell production bottlenecks are loosening, whether cloud services providers will keep spending more on data centers — in light of DeepSeek’s success with cheaper chips, and the impact of Trump’s tariffs on Nvidia’s outlook. Nvidia remains bullish about its future. The drop in the company’s stock price is an “overcorrection,” CEO Jensen Huang said, according to Yahoo! Finance. Demand for the company’s GPUs will remain strong because major processing capability is needed to enable the shift from training AI models to post-training, he added. Here are four things investors will be looking for. Nothing would be better for Nvidia bulls than a higher-than-expected growth forecast. Indeed, Nvidia’s boffo forecast for the second quarter of 2023 spurred me to write my latest book, Brain Rush. Sadly, that growth has been slowing down since the company reported faster than 200% growth every quarter between the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Here are the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rates, according to Macrotrends: As the company’s revenue growth has been declining in recent quarters, I would not be surprised if Nvidia forecasts 50% revenue growth for the current quarter. Last November, one analyst said Trump would be good for Nvidia. That prediction could be a bit off. The analyst expected higher margins and benefit from the Trump presidency. Nvidia “is on track to see Blackwell revenue surge, surpassing Hopper revenue by Apr-Q (gross margins to also recover toward mid-70's by mid-CY [calendar year] 2025),” according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino’s report feature in Barron’s. “Geopolitical uncertainties remain a headwind, but we think Nvidia is better positioned under a Trump administration.” Now reports are emerging of a policy curveball. The Trump administration has started discussions about increasing export chip curbs to China that could weigh on Nvidia’s “revenue by making it tougher to sell its products to tech companies like Alibaba Group,” according to Barron’s. Investors may be listening for what Nvidia has to say about this topic. The last time Nvidia reported quarterly earnings, Blackwell production costs were cutting into the company’s adjusted gross profit margins – which the company attributed to clearing out production bottlenecks, according to my November 2024 Forbes post. “The challenge that we have is how fast can we get that supply, getting ready, into the market this quarter,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told analysts in the post-earnings conference call last November. “We’ll be back on track with more suppliers as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We’re just going to be tight for this quarter.” The Blackwell problems were reportedly tied to design flaws. When deployed in server racks, the chips overheated, “raising alarms about the ability to integrate them efficiently into existing data center models,” noted Reuters. Now that we are into the new calendar year, investors will be listening for whether the company has realized Kress’ hope for bottleneck relief. If not, Nvidia stock could drop. Huang said he may discuss “the ramifications of DeepSeek’s advancement for AI investments” during Wednesday’s earnings call. Recent earnings calls from hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms suggested they would spend $320 billion on data centers and related hardware in 2025. Since then, Microsoft — which had said it intends to spend more than $80 billion — has reportedly canceled some leases with “at least two private data center operators,” noted CNBC. Microsoft did not confirm this report. “Our plans to spend over $80B on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand,” a Microsoft spokesperson emailed CNBC on February 24. Nevertheless, investors will be eager to learn whether Nvidia quantifies how much DeepSeek is likely to affect hyperscaler capital expenditures. Huang is an amazing entrepreneur and CEO and it will take all his ability to exceed investor expectations on Wednesday.

Title: How is the price of gold determined by sellers?

Watch CBS News We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. By Erin Gobler Edited By Angelica Leicht February 25, 2025 / 9:51 AM EST / CBS News Gold as an investment dates back to roughly 550 BC, long before modern investments like stocks and index funds, but it remains an important part of the investment landscape today. In fact, Americans generally believe gold to be a better long-term investment than stocks, savings accounts or bonds, according to a recent Gallup poll. And, interest in gold is only growing now that the price of gold has been climbing. After breaking numerous records on its price run in 2024 — and a renewed upward climb since the start of 2025 — the price of gold now sits close to $2,950 per ounce. However, that's just the spot price of gold, which isn't necessarily the same price you'll pay as an investor. So, it's important to understand how sellers set the retail price of gold, which is information you can use to find the best deal when shopping for your gold investment. Learn more about how to start investing in gold now. The current price of gold is known as its spot price. But as an investor, that's not typically the price you'll pay. "At its core, gold pricing follows a simple formula: Spot price + premium = Retail price," says Nidhi Singhvi, co-founder and CEO of the jewelry store Sonolore. The premium is an additional cost that's added to the spot price to account for business costs, including production and distribution, as well as profit margins. According to Singvi, dealers each set their own premiums and may adjust their retail prices as the spot price changes, which could happen daily. Retailers may also adjust their premiums to account for changes in the gold market, such as high demand or limited supply, even if the spot price hasn't necessarily changed. Another factor that can affect your costs is the physical form of the gold you're purchasing. For example, the choice between gold bars and coins, as well as any additional designs included, may raise or lower your costs. Generally speaking, the simpler and less processed the gold you're purchasing, the lower the premium will be. "Here is where things get interesting and opaque — premiums vary wildly by seller," says Singhvi. "A gold bar from a major retailer like Costco might have a lower markup than a boutique coin shop, while a luxury brand might charge an exorbitant premium." Gold differs from other popular investments in this way. For example, you wouldn't expect the price of a popular stock or index fund to be markedly different from one broker to the next, but you could find stark differences in the price of gold. For that reason, it's important to shop around to compare prices at various dealers. Make sure to add in any added costs, including shipping costs, transaction fees and storage (if applicable). Find out how gold could benefit your investment portfolio. When the spot price of gold increases, you can expect the retail price to rise along with it. Various factors can affect gold's spot price. For example, just like any other asset, the price of gold generally follows supply and demand. If demand is high and supply is low, the price is likely to increase. Gold prices can also be affected by economic conditions, both locally and globally. Changes in interest rates, inflation and other asset markets can all play a role. Additionally, the gold spot price may fluctuate in response to geopolitical events. The demand for gold — and, therefore, the price of gold — may increase during times of uncertainty like war or significant market downturns. Gold is traded all over the world, meaning events and economic factors in more than just the U.S. can affect its price. "While prices have already reached record highs, macroeconomic factors suggest continued demand, supporting the potential for further gains," says Joseph Cavatoni of the World Gold Council. First, gold is considered a hedge against inflation, in part thanks to its limited supply. And while inflation isn't as high today as it was just a couple of years ago, the latest data shows an uptick in the inflation rate. And according to Cavatoni, gold can protect investors from far more than inflation. "Given the current economic uncertainty, geopolitical risks, and volatility in risk assets, gold continues to prove its value as a safe-haven investment," says Cavatoni. Gold has plenty of other benefits worth considering, including portfolio diversification and liquidity, not to mention an increasing number of ways to invest. In addition to buying physical gold, investors can also opt for options like gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or gold mining ETFs. If you're going to invest in gold, knowing the spot price of gold isn't necessarily enough. After all, dealers typically add a premium to the price, which accounts for things like business costs, profit margins, gold storage, and more. If you're considering investing in gold, shop around for the best price — this can help you find a dealer that charges a lower premium. That being said, it is also helpful to monitor the current spot price and know which factors, from inflation to interest rate to market events, may impact it. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: Time To Turn Bullish On Ethereum? CryptoQuant CEO Spots Key Signals

Ethereum (ETH) has plummeted 11.4% in the past 24 hours, reflecting a broader market downturn that saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop by 8%, XRP by 13.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 12.9%. Despite the sea of red, several leading voices—including CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju—are calling for a more optimistic perspective on ETH. Sharing his “bullish thoughts on ETH” via X, Ki Young Ju argued there has been “no significant sell pressure” despite the recent Bybit hack, pointing out that both on-chain and market data remain neutral. “Exchange selling takes time, and OTC offloads barely affect the price,” he added. He also emphasized Ethereum’s dominant share of the stablecoin market cap—currently around 56% and noted how potential regulatory shifts under the Trump administration, which is reportedly “easing crypto regs,” could spur further adoption of ETH-based stablecoins and smart contracts in 2025. Ju referenced additional catalysts, reminding followers that the ETH spot ETF “is already approved,” suggesting that a “Large Cap ETF altseason” might be on the horizon for Ethereum. He added, “BlackRock ETH spot ETF holdings increased 124% over the past three months.” Lastly, Ju highlighted growing whale accumulation: addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH have increased their balances by 24% over the past year, with the current price “nearing the cost basis of accumulating addresses.” However, Ju admitted he was “surprised” by what he sees as an overwhelmingly bearish mood on Crypto Twitter. “Wow, CT [Crypto Twitter] sentiment on ETH is extremely bearish. Let me know if you have any data-driven analysis to support your bearish thesis. Most bears seem to cite the dropping price itself as their reason for selling. Very interesting,” Ju remarked. On his alternative X account—under the handle @kate_young_ju—he reiterated that “whales are stacking ETH,” pointing to the current cost basis for these accumulating addresses at around $2,199, compared to the spot price hovering near $2,505. Ju is not alone in challenging the doom-and-gloom market narrative. AdrianoFeria.eth (@AdrianoFeria), an member of the ETH community, asserted that “the market is in the shitter” but urged investors to focus on high-level institutional and political signals favoring Ethereum. He specifically cited reports of the US President and family purchasing “hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH,” the CEO of BlackRock’s endorsement of tokenization (and BlackRock’s own tokenized USD experiment on Ethereum), and Bybit’s need to buy large quantities of ETH to cover its hack—potentially fueling more demand. Feria also mentioned that Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel believes Ethereum could replace Bitcoin. For this community member, the fact that “everyone on CT is still taking a shit on ETH” only reinforces a contrarian bullish stance. Popular crypto analyst IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) weighed in by posting a chart showing another “red scary candle” but indicating a buy zone above $2,400. Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, offered historical perspective, reminding followers of 2021’s mid-cycle drawdowns: BTC fell 56%, ETH 61%, SOL 67%, and many other assets 70-80%. According to Burniske, “you can come up with all the reasons for why this cycle is different, but the mid-bull reset we’re going through isn’t unprecedented. Those calling for a full blown bear are misguided.” At press time, ETH traded at $2.382.

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Germans voted in a federal election on Sunday and the results are clear: The right-leaning Union parties (CDU/CSU) gained the biggest share of votes and are on course to lead the next government. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) grabbed the second biggest share of votes, showing that the anti-immigration party has become a significant political force. We asked our readers to share their thoughts on the election results in a snap survey. Nearly one-third of those who immediately responded said they were eligible to vote in the election – meaning they already held a German passport, or had recently naturalised. Two-thirds of respondents were ineligible to vote because they didn’t have German citizenship. Many foreign residents living in Germany are unable to vote for this reason. In fact there are more people living in Germany without a German passport than there were votes for AfD in the past election. [There are currently 12.9 million people living in Germany without citizenship, whereas the AfD got nearly 10.2 million first votes.] OPINION: In Germany's election, too many voices will yet again go unheard A post shared by Arne Semsrott (@arne.semsrott) Despite their inability to vote, foreign residents will still be affected by policies crafted by the incoming conservative-led government, and also by anti-immigrant sentiments which are fuelled by the AfD. Many of our readers expressed concerns about the shift to the right in German politics that these elections have highlighted, while others were hopeful that centre-right leadership may boost the German economy. READ ALSO: What kind of coalition government should Germany expect after election? Foreign residents upset to see Germany shift to the right Asked how they felt about the election results, many readers said they felt “worried”, “nervous” or even “terrified”. Some noted that they were not surprised. In general it appears that the victory of the conservatives (who made tightening immigration policies a big part of their campaign) and the gain in support for a far right anti-immigration party has left a bad taste in the mouths of many in the non-German population. READ ALSO: German word of the day - Rechtsruck Only a very few respondents expressed positive feelings about the result. But at least one reader found reason to celebrate Germany’s democratic tradition. “Extraordinary results!” wrote Bhavesh Uppal, a 33-year-old sales manager in Berlin, adding that the incoming Bundestag maintains a full-spectrum of political offers. “From Die Linke to AfD – there’s unity in diversity of opinions.” Serious concerns about the AfD’s popularity Top of mind for many respondents was the AfD’s surge in support, from just over 10 percent in 2021 to around 20 percent now. With local chapters of the party formally considered right-wing extremist, and with leaders who have criticised Holocaust remembrance, invoked Nazi slogans and promoted deporting foreigners, many legally established immigrants in Germany have clear reasons for rejecting the party. “I don't feel safe and frankly have no plans to travel anywhere near the East German states,” said David, alluding to the fact that the AfD won the majority of votes in nearly every constituency in the former East German states. READ ALSO: How different groups of Germans voted in the federal election Sabrina Mercer, a 68-year-old retired teacher living in Frankfurt said she was “horrified” about the AfD’s success and glad that they did not go much higher than 20 percent of the vote. “I feel if they had taken the lead now with what is happening in the world, in light of the new alliance between Trump and Putin, it would have been disastrous on many levels.” Nancy Landrum, a 63-year-old professor in Leipzig echoed these sentiments: “It's unsettling that the AfD had so much support. Germany is one place we thought we could escape extreme far-right ideologies. As an immigrant, I am worried.” For some readers, who feel targeted by the far right party, seeing them gain so much voter support felt deeply personal. “At least one fifth of the voters hate me and want me gone,” wrote Dmitry, a 36-year-old software engineer in Düsseldorf. IN NUMBERS: What happened in the German election? But most respondents had expected the vote to go this way, even if they noted concerns about the general trend toward right wing populism. I can feel the change in the last two years and the anti-immigrant sentiment is only growing due to AfD’s rhetoric,” said Juan, who lives in Munich. “I still hope for the best with a centre coalition." Erica, a 41-year-old freelance copywriter in Berlin, said she expected this result but had hoped the centre-left would have retained more votes. She added, “Elon Musk's endorsement of AfD exposed some of the party's internal contradictions: The so-called nationalist party of the economically disenfranchised directly aligns with an über-rich immigrant's views." Despite their hardline anti-immigration stance, the far right party does find some support among foreign residents. A handful of respondents to our survey indicated that they voted for, or would have voted for, the AfD – amounting to about 20 percent of those surveyed, which is roughly aligned with the proportion of AfD voters seen across the country. “I am disappointed that the AfD did not perform more strongly,” wrote Denizan, a 31-year-old engineer in Bremen. He suggested that the Union parties have “already betrayed their election mandate to deport more illegal immigrants…This is particularly concerning to me as a legal immigrant who did everything right to become naturalised and have worked hard my entire life.” 'I don't trust Merz' Despite their increased support, the AfD is still not in a position to govern in Germany. Leading the country’s next coalition government will be CDU leader Friedrich Merz. Asked how they felt about Merz becoming Germany’s next Chancellor, readers of The Local had mixed responses. Overall, the response to Merz could be described as less than positive. Many readers who disliked him said they didn’t trust him to follow through on campaign promises, or expected him to push Germany further to the right. “Big yikes,” said Elizabeth, a 31-year-old software engineer in Berlin. “I don't expect him to uphold norms or be a trustworthy coalition partner, and I think his strategy will be to try to make the SPD blink by threatening them with the AfD.” “This new, more right-wing CDU worries me,” said Carlos, a 38-year-old Cologne-based software developer. “As a European citizen, I don't exactly have direct fears about immigration policies, but I wouldn't like to see a Germany with closed borders.” Carlos added that he’d prefer to see the next government coalition take aim at structural problems such as heavy bureaucracy. READ ALSO: Netanyahu, Trump and the far right - What Merz said the day after German election Interestingly, Merz’ business credentials earned him both support and criticism, depending on readers’ views of his politics. Simon Slade, a retiree living in Frankfurt described Merz as “an old wealthy white man who worked for Blackrock and lacks both empathy and understanding of what is required.” In support of Merz, Leoni, a 54-year-old English teacher in Leipzig said, “I believe he can stabilise the struggling economy...” But Leoni added that if Merz works more with the far right, that could hurt the country’s ability to attract skilled workers. Another reader noted that his business-friendly politics could be popular with companies, but said they hope he doesn’t give up on Germany's climate promises.

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A 2024 report finds young males (13-30) crave vulnerable male characters. But experts wonder if a cultural shift could lead Hollywood in another direction Late last year, entertainment industry tracker NRG (National Research Group) released a study concluding that 43% of young men aged 13-30 don’t know what it means to be a man in today’s society. “Like Ken in the ‘Barbie’ movie, men are struggling to figure out their own place,” the study says, referring to the hit movie’s multicultural troupe of “just Kens” who are baffled by the increasing power of women. The report also suggests Hollywood may be remiss in not filling the void. “A sizable number (47%) of those surveyed are looking to fictional characters, public figures, and celebrities for masculine role models over real people in their lives — signaling how important it is that Hollywood and celebrities present a multi-faceted view of what it means to be a man,” the authors state.

This study adopts and validates an anesthetic protocol designed for rat whisker stimulation experiments, achieving significant enhancements in the neural response of the barrel field cortex. By combining alpha-chloralose, low-dose Isoflurane (0.5%) and Dexdomitor, the protocol not only maintains a stable anesthetic state but also markedly improves the amplitude and latency of local field potential (LFP) signals. Experimental results reveal that LFP amplitudes in the barrel field under this protocol are twice as high as those achieved with Isoflurane and four times as high as those with Ketamine-Xylazine, with significantly shortened latencies and reduced noise interference. For the first time, power spectral analysis reveals a distinct enhancement of oscillatory power in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, diverging from the traditional dominance of delta (0.5–4 Hz) oscillations observed with other anesthetics. Mechanistically, this phenomenon may be attributed to alpha-chloralose’s unique modulation of GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways, promoting cortical desynchronization and enhanced sensory processing. This protocol offers new insights into optimizing sensory-evoked neural signal acquisition and provides a reference for future studies exploring neural modulation in sensory neuroscience.

Competing interests: There are no actual or apparent conflict of interest in this study for any of the co-authors. In neurophysiological research, the barrel cortex of rats serves as a core model for processing tactile information, playing a particularly significant role in whisker stimulation experiments [1,2]. The precise anatomical structure and functional characteristics of the barrel cortex make it an ideal platform for investigating tactile perception, sensorimotor integration, and cortical neural network dynamics [3,4]. However, obtaining high-quality local field potential (LFP) signals remains a major challenge due to muscle noise interference and physiological fluctuations induced by anesthesia [5,6]. These issues not only compromise the stability and reliability of experimental data but may also obscure deeper insights into the mechanisms of sensory neural activity. Therefore, developing optimized anesthetic protocols tailored for long-term neural recordings is crucial [7,8]. Commonly used anesthetics include Isoflurane [9,10] and Ketamine-Xylazine [11,12]. While these anesthetics meet the requirements of short-term experiments, their limitations in long-term neural recordings are apparent. Isoflurane requires continuous administration to maintain its anesthetic effect, but it often causes physiological fluctuations, such as a decrease in body temperature and unstable heart rate, which can significantly impact the stability of neural signals [13,14]. In contrast, Ketamine-Xylazine provides effective sedation but has a short duration of action (approximately 30 minutes), necessitating frequent re-dosing. This increases the complexity of experimental operations and often leads to significant physiological fluctuations, reducing the reliability of experimental results [15–17]. These limitations highlight the urgent need for a stable anesthetic protocol capable of minimizing interference during long-term experiments to meet the demand for high-quality data in sensory neuroscience research [18,19]. To address these issues, some studies have explored improved anesthetic protocols. For example, Yuan et al. found that alpha-chloralose could effectively enhance the quality of raw brain signals by comparing different anesthetic protocols [20]. While this approach has demonstrated significant advantages in reducing muscle noise interference and improving signal clarity, its suitability for long-term experiments, its effect on specific LFP frequency bands, and its regulatory mechanisms on neural signals still require further investigation [21]. Building on this, the present study proposes an anesthetic protocol designed for whisker stimulation experiments. By combining alpha-chloralose with low-dose Isoflurane (0.5%) and supplementing it with Dexdomitor to suppress muscle activity, this protocol significantly improves LFP signal clarity while effectively maintaining the core physiological stability of the animals [20]. Experiments show that, compared to traditional anesthetic protocols using Isoflurane or Ketamine-Xylazine alone, this combined protocol demonstrates superior stability and reliability over the course of 7-hour experiments [22]. Moreover, Dexdomitor exhibits unique advantages in reducing noise interference caused by muscle activity, providing additional support for the accuracy of data in long-term neural recording experiments [16]. In addition to validating the practical utility of the anesthetic protocol, this study systematically investigates the frequency-domain characteristics of LFP signals under different anesthetic protocols. Power spectral analysis reveals that alpha-chloralose anesthesia significantly enhances oscillatory power in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands, in stark contrast to the delta-band-dominated characteristics commonly observed with other anesthetics [23]. This phenomenon may be attributed to alpha-chloralose’s ability to regulate GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways, promoting cortical desynchronization and enhancing neural responses. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: The rest of this paper is organized as following: Section II states experimental setups. Section III introduces three different anesthetics methods and experimental system. The experiment results are present to validate our techniques’ superiority in Section IV. Section V concludes this paper. This section first introduces the source of animals used in our experiments. Then, we show the details of the preparing things for the experimental setups. The 30 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (31-12-002-D-000010), weighing 250–350 g, were purchased from the Institute of Medical Experimental Animals at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. They were housed under a strict 12-hour light-dark cycle in animal room accredited by the Animal Protection and Use Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University. All procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the committee. Animals had ad libitum access to food and water, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering and ensure ethical treatment, in alignment with ARRIVE guidelines (PLoS Biol 8(6): e1000412, 2010). In this study, we conducted comparative experiments on 3 groups (G1 = 10, G2 = 10, G3 = 10) to evaluate the effects of three anesthesia methods: alpha-chloralose, Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine. On the experimental day, animals were randomly assigned to different anesthesia protocol groups to minimize potential biases. To accurately collect the electroencephalogram (EEG) response signals of rats’ whisker stimulation, we followed a series of preparatory steps as outlined in [24]. In this section, we first introduce three anesthetic methods (alpha-chloralose, Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine) used in animal experiments. Then we present the details of whisker stimulation experimental system. Alpha-chloralose induces a sedative state by enhancing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity in rodents. Typically administered via intravenous or intraperitoneal injection for anesthesia in rats and mice, it effectively maintains the animals in a sedated or unconscious state, thereby minimizing discomfort and stress responses triggered by external stimuli. In this study, the time interval from Isoflurane induction to the administration of alpha-chloralose was approximately 25 minutes (4 minutes for induction, 15-20 minutes for surgical procedures and electrode placement, and 2-3 minutes for physiological observation). Subsequently, alpha-chloralose was administered to the rats via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 4.0 mg/kg (i.p.). Finally, LFP signals were recorded. Isoflurane is typically administered via inhalation, with its primary mechanism being the enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity in the central nervous system and the inhibition of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, thereby achieving an anesthetic effect. Due to its rapid onset and favorable recovery profile, Isoflurane is widely used in animal experiments. In this experiment, to prevent SD rats from unexpectedly waking during stimulation, Isoflurane should be maintained at an anesthesia level of 1.5% to collect LFP signals from the barrel cortex following whisker stimulation. The Ketamine-Xylazine is known for its rapid onset and short duration of anesthesia, making it an ideal choice for procedures requiring quick recovery. It is widely used in minor surgeries and diagnostic imaging to enhance anesthetic and sedative effects. Generally speaking, the anesthetic effect of Ketamine-Xylazine in rats lasts for only 30 minutes. Similarly, the time interval from Isoflurane induction to Ketamine-Xylazine administration was also approximately 25 minutes. Then, the rats were administered Ketamine (80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Finally, we recorded the LFP signals. Rats’ whiskers are sensitive detectors for tactile information, allowing them to navigate, recognize, and perceive their surroundings. As shown in Fig 1a, each whisker corresponds to a specialized barrel structure in the somatosensory cortex of the rat brain [1]. To capture specific neural signals triggered by whisker stimulation, this study applied mechanical stimulation to a single whisker. Fig 1b shows that an L-shaped tube is connected to the shaft of a stepper motor, and the target whisker (C2 of the large barrel column) is inserted into the tube. The Arduino UNO R3 controller and A4988 stepper motor driver together drive the motor shaft rotation, while a pulse generator (Master 8, A.M.P.I.) provides trigger signal. The Cerbus device is connected to recording electrodes to collect real-time LFP signals following whisker stimulation.

[25] and Tsytsarev et al. [26], in this study, the whisker was deflected counterclockwise from the head to the tail at a speed of 200 mm/s and then returned to its original position. Each deflection had an amplitude of 0.2 mm and employed a “ramp-and-hold” stimulus mode with a rise/fall time of 1 ms, maintaining a total deflection duration of 3 ms per stimulus. The interval between each stimulus was 1.5 seconds, and the entire experiment was repeated 200 times to ensure the reliability of cortical responses. This section first present the barrel cortex LFP signals under different anesthetics protocols by whisker stimulation. Then we conduct a comparative analysis, emphasizing the robustness of the signals collected through our protocol. Finally, we demonstrate that our protocol results in minimal alterations in physiological parameters, highlighting its efficacy and safety. The 30 animals were randomly assigned to three groups, with each group receiving one of the anesthetic protocols to ensure equal representation in the sample. We used AgCl extracellular electrode to record the animals’ brain EEG under alpha-chloralose, Isoflurane, and Ketamine-xylazine anesthetic protocols before whisker stimulation. When using a low concentration of Isoflurane (0.5%) or alpha-chloralose alone for anesthesia, animals typically wake within half an hour, displaying responses such as toe or ear twitches. Fig 2 showed stable EEG signals obtained under three anesthesia protocols. It can be seen that with alpha-chloralose combined with 0.25% Isoflurane, the EEG signals remain stable but include some muscle noise; with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, the EEG signal improves significantly. Using 1.5% Isoflurane alone eliminates muscle noise in the EEG. Although Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia has a stronger effect than 1.5% Isoflurane, it still introduces some muscle noise. These findings indicate that the combination of alpha-chloralose and 0.5% Isoflurane is an optimal approach for acquiring high-quality EEG signals from the animal brain. Accordingly, we employed this combination to record barrel cortex LFP signals in response to whisker stimulation. We stimulated the C2 whisker to find the precise C2 barrel column location. As shown in Fig 3, we can clear see that the C2 barrel column is located at 2.5 mm posterior and 5.5 mm lateral to bregma, within the left hemisphere. Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.25% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in black; Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.5% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in red; 1.5% Isoflurane is represented in green; and Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia is represented in blue. Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.25% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in black; Alpha-chloralose combined with 0.5% Isoflurane anesthesia is represented in red; 1.5% Isoflurane is represented in green; and Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia is represented in blue. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318306.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318306.g003 We also analyzed the barrel cortex LFP signals and their corresponding Power Spectral Density (PSD) under whisker stimulation across different anesthetic protocols. As illustrated in Fig 4a, significant differences in the barrel cortex LFP signal amplitudes and peak latencies induced by whisker stimulation were observed under different anesthetic protocols. The peak amplitude under alpha-chloralose anesthesia (~800 µV) was approximately twice that under Isoflurane (~400 µV) and four times that under Ketamine-Xylazine (~200 µV). Furthermore, the peak latency of the LFP response under alpha-chloralose anesthesia was notably shorter (~17 ms) compared to Isoflurane (~18 ms) and Ketamine-Xylazine (~20 ms). These differences in both amplitude and latency likely reflect the distinct effects of each anesthetic protocol on cortical desynchronization, neural responsiveness, and signal transmission efficiency. Alpha-chloralose, by preserving excitability and minimizing inhibition, significantly enhances neural responsiveness and reduces latency, making it superior for capturing sensory-evoked LFP signals. In contrast, the stronger cortical suppression associated with Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine not only results in lower LFP amplitudes but also prolongs peak latencies, indicating slower cortical response times. Fig 4b provides a detailed comparison of the PSD of LFP signal responses induced by whisker stimulation under three different anesthetic conditions. Compared to Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine anesthesia, alpha-chloralose anesthesia significantly enhances the power of LFP signals in the low-frequency (alpha band, 8–13 Hz) and mid-frequency (beta band, 13–30 Hz) ranges. Notably, while delta band activity (0.5–4 Hz) typically dominates under deep anesthesia, it is markedly suppressed under alpha-chloralose anesthesia. This suppression may also be attributed to cortical desynchronization induced by whisker stimulation and the unique pharmacological properties of alpha-chloralose, which maintain neural responsiveness and amplify oscillatory activities in the alpha and beta bands. These findings not only highlight the superior ability of alpha-chloralose anesthesia to enhance the intensity and frequency response of neural signals induced by whisker stimulation but also reveal differences in the modulation of delta, alpha, and beta band activities across different anesthetic protocols. This modulation is of critical importance for optimizing neural signal acquisition in in vivo brain stimulation experiments and provides valuable insights for both research and clinical applications. (a) Barrel cortex LFP signals recorded during whisker stimulation under three anesthetic conditions: alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane (red), 1.5% Isoflurane (green), and Ketamine-Xylazine (blue). The time axis represents the duration of whisker stimulation in milliseconds, and the voltage axis represents the LFP signal amplitude in microvolts (µV). The peak LFP amplitude is highest with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, followed by 1.5% Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine. (b) Power spectral density (PSD) analysis of LFP signals across different anesthetic protocols. The alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands are highlighted with shaded regions (pink for alpha, blue for beta). The PSD comparison shows that alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane significantly amplifies power in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, while 1.5% Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine show reduced power in these bands.

The experiment indicates that alpha-chloralose anesthesia reaches its deepest state at 2 hours, followed by a gradual recovery of neural activity and an enhanced response to whisker stimulation. Under whisker stimulation, we monitored the amplitude and peak latency of LFP signals in the barrel cortex to evaluate the effects of different anesthesia protocols. This evaluation method is similar to the one used in previous studies [27]. Fig 5 presents the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of LFP signal amplitudes and peak latencies under three anesthesia protocols. Compared to Isoflurane or Ketamine-Xylazine, alpha-chloralose anesthesia protocol has a greater LFP signal strength and a shorter latency period. Initially, the LFP signal amplitudes and peak latencies were 790 ± 13 uV and 17 ± 1.3 ms for alpha-chloralose, 388 ± 11 uV and 18 ± 1.1 ms for Isoflurane, and 201 ± 14 uV and 21 ± 1.4 ms for Ketamine-Xylazine. Then 800 ± 10 uV and 16.9 ± 1.0 ms, 400 ± 12 uV and 17.9 ± 1.2 ms, 202 ± 17 uV and 22 ± 1.7 ms after 0.5 hours, respectively. After 7 hours, they became to 820 ± 16 uV and 17 ± 1.6 ms, and 311 ± 17 uV and 21 ± 1.7 ms. Repeated measures ANOVA confirmed that the differences in LFP signal strength among the anesthesia protocols were statistically significant (*p < 0.05). Moreover, independent samples t-tests revealed a significant difference in peak latency between the alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane and 1.5% Isoflurane protocols (*p < 0.05), indicating that the combination of alpha-chloralose and low-dose Isoflurane results in faster neural responses compared to higher concentrations of Isoflurane. In conclusion, the alpha-chloralose anesthesia protocol not only supports prolonged LFP signal recording in the barrel cortex but also significantly enhances the reliability of the data by maintaining high signal strength and reducing latency over time. This makes it a superior choice for long-term neural recordings compared to other commonly used anesthesia protocols such as Isoflurane and Ketamine-Xylazine.

The anesthetic effect of Ketamine-Xylazine lasts only 0.5 hours, and its potential lethal risk precludes repeated use on the same animal. Therefore, we recorded the physiological parameters for Ketamine-Xylazine over 0.5 hours, and for alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane over 7 hours. (a) Mean and SEM of heart rate changes over 7 hours for animals anesthetized with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, 1.5% Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine. Statistical significance (*p < 0.05) was observed between alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane groups. *Represents the significance. (b) Mean and SEM of body temperature changes over 7 hours for animals anesthetized with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, 1.5% Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine.

(a) Mean and SEM of heart rate changes over 7 hours for animals anesthetized with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, 1.5% Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine.

(b) Mean and SEM of body temperature changes over 7 hours for animals anesthetized with alpha-chloralose + 0.5% Isoflurane, 1.5% Isoflurane, and Ketamine-Xylazine.

After 7 hours, the heart rates in the alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane groups further dropped to 280 ± 3.2 bpm and 261 ± 3.5 bpm, respectively. The results of one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that the difference in heart rate between alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane was statistically significant (*p < 0.05), indicating that these two anesthetic protocols had significantly different effects on heart rate control. An independent samples t-test further confirmed this difference (*p < 0.05), with the alpha-chloralose group showing a relatively stable decrease in heart rate, while the Isoflurane group exhibited a greater drop in heart rate. These findings suggest that alpha-chloralose can induce a relatively stable decrease in heart rate, making it particularly suitable for experiments involving long-term data collection. In contrast, Ketamine-Xylazine led to a rapid and pronounced decrease in heart rate, limiting its applicability for long-term observations. Fig 6b present a typical temperature fluctuations among all experimental conditions. Initially, the baseline body temperature were 33.1 ± 1.3 °C for alpha-chloralose, 32.6 ± 1.8 °C for Isoflurane, and 32.2 ± 2.0 °C for Ketamine-Xylazine. Then decreased to 32.6 ± 2.0 °C, 32.1 ± 1.8 °C, and 31 ± 1.6 °C after 0.5 hours, respectively. After 7 hours, they became to 29.6 ± 1.2 °C, and 28.8 ± 2.2 °C. The results of a one-way ANOVA analysis indicated that the difference in body temperature fluctuations between alpha-chloralose and Isoflurane was statistically significant (*p < 0.05), suggesting that these two anesthetic protocols had significantly different effects on body temperature stability. An independent samples t-test further confirmed this difference (*p < 0.05), with the alpha-chloralose group showing a relatively stable decrease in body temperature over time, while the Isoflurane group exhibited a more pronounced drop in temperature. This suggests that alpha-chloralose can maintain a relatively stable decrease in body temperature, making it particularly suitable for long-term neural recording experiments where temperature stability is crucial. Stable temperature control is essential for accurate measurement of nervous system function, as excessively low or high body temperatures may alter neural signal conduction speed and neuronal activity, thereby affecting the reliability of LFP data. In contrast, Ketamine-Xylazine causes a rapid drop in body temperature, increasing the risk of data fluctuations and limiting its applicability for prolonged stable observations. The significant differences in the peak amplitudes and latencies of the barrel cortex LFP signals and heart rate and body temperature changes observed under different anesthetic protocols can be attributed to the distinct pharmacological properties of the anesthetics and their effects on neural excitability and cortical dynamics. The barrel cortex LFP signals and their corresponding PSD under whisker stimulation underscore the importance of choosing appropriate anesthetic protocols to optimize neural signal acquisition in sensory-evoked studies. Alpha-chloralose’s ability to preserve neural excitability and enhance cortical responses makes it a superior choice for experiments requiring precise and stable LFP recordings. Meanwhile, the observed dominance of alpha and beta bands in the power spectrum, rather than typical delta oscillations under anesthesia, can be attributed to the experimental paradigm and the choice of anesthetic agent. Whisker stimulation enhances cortical oscillations in the alpha and beta bands, associated with sensory processing and sensorimotor integration [33,36]. Alpha-chloralose anesthesia preserves cortical responsiveness, amplifying alpha and beta activities while suppressing delta oscillations typical of deep anesthesia [30,37]. These results provide valuable insights for future studies aiming to refine anesthetic techniques for in vivo neural signal acquisition. In the course of anesthesia, the gradual decrease in body temperature and heart rate over time can primarily be attributed to the effects of anesthetics, such as Isoflurane and alpha-chloralose, which act as central nervous system depressants inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity [38]. Isoflurane, in particular, induces rapid vasodilation, leading to significant heat loss and a rapid drop in body temperature [39]. In contrast, alpha-chloralose demonstrates a more gradual and stable decline in body temperature and heart rate, potentially due to its milder impact on the hypothalamic thermoregulation center [40]. Furthermore, alpha-chloralose offers a longer duration of anesthetic effects (up to 7 hours) compared to Ketamine-Xylazine, which lasts only about 30 minutes, making it more suitable for prolonged experiments [41]. In our study, while both heart rate and body temperature decreased under alpha-chloralose anesthesia, the rate of change was more stable than with Isoflurane, allowing for better maintenance of physiological stability during long-term neural recordings. This study proposes an anesthesia protocol combining Isoflurane, Dexdomitor, and alpha-chloralose to optimize the quality of barrel cortex LFP signals elicited by whisker stimulation. It systematically compares different anesthesia protocols in terms of signal characteristics, physiological stability, and neural response latency. The novelty of this study is highlighted in three key aspects: 1) In-depth Exploration of the Anesthesia Protocol and Signal Enhancement Mechanism: The experimental results demonstrate that alpha-chloralose anesthesia significantly enhances the amplitude of barrel cortex LFP signals (approximately twice that of Isoflurane and four times that of Ketamine-Xylazine) and shortens peak latency. Compared to conventional anesthesia methods, these advantages are attributed to the desynchronization and balancing mechanisms facilitated by alpha-chloralose through the modulation of GABA and glutamate pathways. This mechanism not only improves cortical responsiveness to whisker stimulation but also avoids the excessive suppression of neuronal excitability seen with Isoflurane and the physiological fluctuations induced by Ketamine-Xylazine. 2) Explanation of the Mechanisms Underlying Anesthesia-Induced Differences: The differences in LFP signal characteristics across anesthesia protocols can be attributed to their distinct pharmacological actions: Isoflurane induces deep neuronal inhibition by activating GABA_A receptors and inhibiting NMDA receptors, leading to reduced LFP signal amplitude and delayed responses. Ketamine-Xylazine causes significant physiological fluctuations (e.g., heart rate and body temperature decreases) due to NMDA receptor blockade and α2-adrenergic agonist effects, which increase signal variability. Alpha-chloralose maintains a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural networks, enabling the cortex to respond to whisker stimulation rapidly and efficiently while reducing delta-band synchronized slow-wave activity. Furthermore, alpha-chloralose’s mild central nervous system suppression makes it suitable for long-term stable recordings. 3) Practical Methodological Value: The study validates the reliability and advantages of alpha-chloralose anesthesia for long-term neural recordings, evidenced by sustained high signal strength (over 800 µ V for 7 hours) and relatively stable heart rate and body temperature. In contrast, Isoflurane caused more pronounced physiological parameter fluctuations, while Ketamine-Xylazine’s rapid induction of heart rate and body temperature drops limited its applicability for prolonged experiments. These findings provide technical guidance for optimizing neural signal acquisition, particularly in sensory neuroscience research that demands high sensitivity and minimal interference. Through a detailed exploration of anesthesia mechanisms and signal differences, this study lays a solid foundation for further advancements in the field of sensory neuroscience.

Most of the U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as global trade tensions intensified. President Donald Trump reaffirmed that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will proceed once the current 30-day reprieve expires. Additionally, his administration is reportedly pushing for stricter U.S. semiconductor restrictions while urging key allies to tighten their own measures against China’s chip industry. Here are stocks to watch today: AMC Entertainment’s (AMC+4.59%) stock experienced a decline on Tuesday, slipping ahead of the company’s highly anticipated earnings report in the evening. Investors appeared cautious as they awaited quarterly results that could provide insight into the theater chain’s performance amid ongoing industry challenges. Shares of the online learning platform Chegg (CHGG-0.47%) fell on Tuesday after the company filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively impacted the company’s traffic and revenue. In the morning, shares were trading at $1.07 each, reaching a new 52-week low. Tokyo Electron (TOELY-2.70%) and other Japanese chipmakers fell in Tokyo trading after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is sketching out tougher versions of U.S. semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry. ASML Holding (ASML+2.68%) was also a subject of the talks, the news agency said. Home Depot (HD+0.85%) stock edged higher after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year; Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Nvidia (NVDA+4.56%) stock slipped on Tuesday as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+17.71%) stock fell on Tuesday following the Trump administration’s latest efforts to tighten semiconductor restrictions. Strategy (MSTR+3.44%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, declined by about 7% in New York trading, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $90,000.

February 25, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Charley Ellis on Rethinking Investing, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, I have an extra, extra special guest. Charlie Ellis is just a legend in the world of investing. He started for the Rockefeller Family Office before going to DLJ and eventually ended up launching Greenwich Associates. He’s published 21 books. He’s won every award you can win in the World, world of Finance. He was a member of Vanguard’s board of director. He was chairman of the Yale’s Endowment Investment Committee and his, not only did he write 21 books, his new book, rethinking Investing, is just a delightful snack. It’s only a hundred pages and it distills 60 years of investing women wisdom into a very, very short read. I found the book excellent. And Charlie, as delightful as always, I really enjoyed our conversation and I think you will also, with no further ado, my discussion with Charlie Alice. Charley Ellis: Thank you, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: Well, thank you for being here. First of all, we’re gonna talk a lot about the book in a bit, which I really just devoured over a cup of tea. It was that short and very delightful. But before we do that, I want people to fully understand what a fascinating background you’ve had and how really interesting your career is. Where you began and where you ended up. You get a master’s in business from Harvard Business School, a PhD from New York University, and then you sort of happened onto Rockefeller Foundation. How did you get that first job? How did you discover your calling? Charley Ellis: A friend of mine at business school said, or have you got a job yet? I said, no, not yet. Got a couple of things that I’m working towards. He said, well, I’ve got a friend, and I thought he meant the Rockefeller Foundation actually. He meant the Rockefeller family in their investment office. And very, very bright guy. Came up from New York to Cambridge, Massachusetts, climbed to the third floor of my apartment building, and we did an interview in what I would have to describe as shabby graduate student facility. And at the end of half an hour, I realized it isn’t the foundation that he’s talking about. He’s talking about something else. And I gotta figure out what that is. At the end of the second half an hour, I knew he was talking about investing where there were no courses at that time, at the Harvard Business School on Investment Management. And he’s really describing the Rockefeller Family Office Barry Ritholtz: Yes. Not necessarily the foundation. So what were they doing at that time? What were their investments like? Charley Ellis: Well, they invested the family’s fortune. And at that time, relative to other family fortunes, it was the large major, so on and so on. They were also, because they’d been generous philanthropically for years, managing several charitable organizations, endowments. So the combination made us a consequential investment client for Wall Street as Wall Street was just coming into doing serious research on individual companies and industries. So it was take off time for what became institutional investing. Barry Ritholtz: So give us some context as to that era. This is the 1970s and eighties, essentially when, when that Charley Ellis: Was in 1960s, Barry Ritholtz: So late sixties, not a lot of data available on a regular basis. And modern portfolio theory was kind of just coming around. Is That right? 00:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it was just a, an academic curiosity. Nobody’s right mind thought it had a chance of being proven. But you know, if you go back to those days, if we came back to it, we would all of us agree with the people who said, no, it’s nothing. It’s not gonna happen. The transformation of the whole investment management world, information availability, legislation, who’s participating? What’s the trading volume? What kind of information is available? How fast can you get it? Wow. Every one of those dimensions has changed and changed and changed. The world is completely different today. Barry Ritholtz: You detail that in the book. We’ll talk about that in a little bit. That if you just go back 50 years, completely different world, as you mentioned, the volume, but who the players are, how technology allows us to do things that we couldn’t do before. And that we’ve also learned a lot since then. Charley Ellis: We sure have, you know, it’s hard to remember, but I do because I was new and fresh. And so it made an impression. Trading volume was 3 million shares in New York. Stock Exchange listed. Now it’s six, seven, 8 billion. That’s a huge change. Order of magnitude. The amount of research that was available was virtually zero. Barry Ritholtz: Now, I recall. Well, the CCH binders used to get updates on a regular basis, the clearinghouse binders, and then it was essentially Zachs and a whole bunch of different companies. But that’s really late eighties, right? Like when did the research explosion really happen? Charley Ellis: The research explosion happened in the seventies and then into the eighties, but the documents that you were looking at or thinking about, were all looking backwards, Give you the plain vanilla facts of what’s happened in the last five years in a standardized format with no analytical or insight available. Now everything about research is a future, and it’s full of factual information and careful interpretation. It’s really different. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really interesting. So how long were you at Rockefeller before you launched Greenwich Associates in 1972? Charley Ellis: Well, I was there for two and a half years. Then I went to Wall Street with Donaldson Lufkin and Jennrette for six, and then I started Greenwich Associates. Barry Ritholtz: So what led you after less than a decade to say, I’m gonna hang my own shingle? It seems kind of bold at that point. You’re barely 30 years old. Charley Ellis: It was a little nervy. I have to graduate. There are a couple of different parts. One is that I knew from my own personal experience, I had no ability to get my clients to tell me what I was doing right or wrong. They’d always say, oh, you’re doing fine. Just keep it up. You’re doing fine. And then I have no idea what my competition was doing. You know, if we could give factual information on exactly how well each firm is doing and how every one of their competitors are doing, we could interpret that in ways that clients would find really useful. And then we could advise them on specific recommendations based on the facts. Really undeniable facts based on 300, 500, 600 interviews with people who made the decisions and it worked Barry Ritholtz: Well I can’t imagine they’re happy with the outcome because what you eventually end up learning is that a lot of people who charge high fees for supposedly expert stock picking, expert market timing expert allocation, they’re not doing so well. And it turns out, at least on the academic side, it appears that the overall market is beating them. Charley Ellis: I wouldn’t quite say it that way, So I wouldn’t deny what you’re saying, but I would’ve say it differently when the purpose of any market, a grocery store, drug store, filling station, the purpose of any market is really to find what’s the right price that people will buy and trade at. And the securities industry is a very strong illustration of that. Lots of buyers, lots of sellers, what do they think is the right price to do a transaction? And they put real money behind it. So that purpose of a market gets better and better and better when the participants are more skillful, when the participants have more information, when the information is really accessible. And that’s what’s happened to the securities markets. The ability to get information from a Bloomberg terminal, if you don’t mind using Mike’s name. Sure. But seriously, Bloomberg Terminal will spew out so much in the way of factual information. And there are hundreds of thousands of these terminals all over the world, huh? So everybody in his right mind has ’em and uses them. Everybody’s right. Mind has computing power that would knock the socks off. Anybody who came from 1970 got dropped into the current period, that would just be amazed at the computing power. And they don’t use slide rules anymore. You know, back in the early seventies, everybody used a slide rule. Wow. And we were proud of ’em, and we were pretty skilled at it. But it’s nothing like having computing power behind you In those days. There were very few in the way of federal regulations. Now it’s against the law for a company to have a private luncheon with someone who’s in the investment world. Barry Ritholtz: Right. Reg FD said it has to be disclosed to everybody at once. So it is, you can’t just whisper it… 00:09:45 [Speaker Changed] And everybody gets the same information at the same time. So basically what you’ve got is everybody in the game is competing with everybody knowing everything that everybody else knows at exactly this very same time. And you can be terribly creative and wonderfully bright and very original, but if everybody knows exactly what you know, then they’ve got computing power. So they can do all kinds of analytics. Then they’ve got Bloomberg terminal, so they can do any backgrounding that they wanna find. It’s really hard to see how you’re gonna be able to beat them by much, if anything. And the truth is that people who are actively investing are usually making, they don’t mean to, but they are making mistakes. And those mistakes put them a little bit behind, a little bit behind, a little bit behind the market. And then of course, they charge fees that are high enough. So trying to recover those fees while trading, and you can only trade successfully by beating the other guy when he’s just as good as you are. He’s got just as big a computer as you have. He’s got just the same factual information you have. Then all those other different dimensions. There’s no way that you could think, oh yeah, this is a good opportunity to do. Well, that’s why people increasingly it, in my view, sensibly turned index funds to cut down on the cost. Huh. Barry Ritholtz: So it’s interesting how well you express that because sometime in the 1970s you start writing your thoughts down and publishing them. Not long after, in 1977 you win a gram and dot award. Tell us what you were writing about back in the 1970s and what were you using for a data series when there really wasn’t a lot of data? 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] Well, the data did come, but it came later. And fortunately it proved out to be very strong confirmation for what I’ve been thinking. But I was in institutional sales and I would go around from one investor to another, to another, to another, to another. And I knew pretty quickly. They’re all really bright guys. They’re all very competitive, they’re all very well informed. They’re all very serious students trying to get better and better and better. Their job is to beat the other guys. But the other guys are getting better and better and better all the time. Striving to be best informed. They get up early, they study on through the night. They take work home on weekends. Competition, competition, competition, competition. How are you going to do better than those other guys when there’s so much in the way of raw input is the same? And the answer is no. You can’t. Barry Ritholtz: Michael Maubboisson calls that the paradox of skill, as all the players in a specific area get more and more skillful. Outcomes tend to be determined more by random luck because everybody playing is so good at the game. 00:12:41 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely true. Barry Ritholtz: So I’m fascinated by this quote. We’ve been talking about errors and making mistakes. One of the things from your book that really resonated is quote, we are surrounded by temptations to be wrong in both investing and in life. Explain, 00:13:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, we all know about life. They were tempted by beautiful men, beautiful women we’re tempted by whiskey, gin, or other drinks where some of us get tempted by drugs and other things like that. So there are lots of temptations out and around that you think about. All of us in the investment world are striving to be rational, which is a terribly difficult thing to do. Warren Buffett is rational and is brilliantly rational. He also does an enormous amount of homework. He also has terrific ability to remember things that he studied and he spends most of his time reading, studying, memorizing and reusing. Very few people have that kind of ability, natural ability that he has. But most of us now have equipment that’ll damn near do the same thing. And you could call up things from the historical record anytime you want to. It puts everybody in a position of being able to compete more and more skillfully all the time. 00:14:10 And therefore, candidly, I think it’s the fees are a big problem. And then the second problem is, yes, we’ve got opportunities to be more and more skillful and more and more effective. But actually what we also have, which really drives anybody who’s serious about examining the data, drives ’em nuts than anybody who is an investor wants to deny it. And that is that we make mistakes. We get scared by the market after it’s gone down. We get excited about the market positively after it’s gone up. And we interpret and make mistakes in our judgment. Now, this wonderful section in this little bitty book that I’ve just finished, wonderful section on behavioral economics, terrific book by Daniel Kahneman, thinking Fast, thinking Slow. That’s several hundred pages. And anybody in the investment world ought to read it because it tells you all about what we need to know about ourselves. 00:15:06 And I’ve got one chapter that just ticks off a whole bunch of things. Like 80% of people think they’re above average dancers. 80% of people think they’re above average drivers. If you ask men a question on are you really above average at various kinds of skills, they get up to pretty 90%, 95% saying they’re very, very, very good. Now, if you look at a college group, are you gonna have happier life than your classmates? Yes, by far. Are you gonna get divorced as much as your classmates? Oh no, that won’t happen to me. Then all kinds of other things that anybody looking at it objectively would say, you know, Barry, that just isn’t the way it’s gonna happen. These guys aren’t that much better drivers than the normal crowd. In fact, they are part of the normal crowd. 00:15:58 [Speaker Changed] You know, we, we all imagine that we’re separate from the crowd. I love the expression, I’m stuck in traffic when the reality is if you are near a major urban center during rush hour on Workday, you’re not stuck in traffic. You are traffic. And we all tend to think of ourselves as separate. Really, really fascinating stuff. I’m fascinated by the evolution of your investing philosophy. You start with Rockefeller Family Office, I assume back in the 1960s that was a fairly active form of investing. Tell us a little bit about how you began, what sort of strategies were you were using and then how you evolved. 00:16:40 [Speaker Changed] Woo. Boy, that’s a complicated question. First of all, in the early sixties when I was working for the Rockefeller family, that was the old world. All kinds of changes have taken place since then and virtually turned every single dimension of what was the right description of the investment world into a very different opposite version. And it change like that makes it almost a waste of time to talk about what was it like. But just for instance, I did some analysis of a company called DuPont Sure. Which was one of the blue chip blue chips of all time. And I had also been studying IBM, which was a wonderful company. And I realized, you know, IBM has got an ability to generate its own growth because it is creating one after another, advancement in computing power. And they’ve got a terrific organization behind it, and they are able to create their own growth. 00:17:43 IBM is a true growth company. DuPont needs to invent something that other people would really want, and it has to be something that’s really new. And then they get patent protection for a certain period of time, and then they lose the patent protection because it’s completed. They’ve got a different situation. Both companies were selling at 30, 32 times earnings. One company I thought was sure to continue growing and the other I wasn’t so sure. So I got permission to go down to Wilmington, Delaware, and for three days I had nothing but one interview after another, after another, after another. Were the senior executive of the DuPont organization. And they were very candid. And they told me about their problems. They told me about their opportunities. They told me about their financial policies. Their first level financial policies were that they would always pay out half their earnings and dividends long established. 00:18:43 And that was the way they did things. And the second thing is, they had a major commitment to nylon, but nylon was no longer patent protected. And so the profit margins of nylon were gonna come down for sure and come down rather rapidly because competition was building up pretty quickly. They hoped to build one terrific business in a leather substitute called Core Fam. But as I talked to the executives, they kept talking to me about, we’re having difficulty getting people to use Core Fam. We’re getting people who make shoes to think about using Core Fam. You know, we can’t get sales outside the United States to really get going. And we’re having a difficult time getting sales inside the United States. And candidly, it doesn’t look like this is gonna turn out to be the bonanza we had all thought it was going to be just a year or so ago. 00:19:35 Well, it doesn’t take a genius and it doesn’t take a very experienced person. And I was not a genius and I was not an experienced person, but I could see the handwriting. Wait a minute, if you only reinvest half your earnings each year and your major business is going to be more and more commoditized and your major new business is not taking off, you got a real problem here and you’re gonna have a tough time keeping up the kind of growth that would justify selling for 30 plus times earnings. Whereas IBM was guaranteed to be virtually guaranteed to be able to do that. ’cause they didn’t have very much the way of competition and they really knew what they were doing and they kept cranking it up. So what do you do? I came back and said, I know that the family, the Rockefeller family has many friends in the DuPont organization, but they also have many friends in the Watson family of IBM. I think it would be a great thing if we would sell off the holdings in DuPont and use the money to buy into IBM go out of one family friends into another, family friends. They would all understand it. And that was what was done. And of course it involved a substantial amount of ownership being shifted. And I’ve always thought to myself, wow. In that one specific recommendation, I earned my keep for several years. 00:21:03 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And and it’s fascinating ’cause that’s what was being done in every institutional investor and every endowment. People were making active choices, 00:21:15 [Speaker Changed] But they also were making lots of mistakes. Right. If you looked at what happened in the two years after my recommendation, IBM doubled and DuPont almost got cut in half. 00:21:26 [Speaker Changed] Wow. So that worked out really well. So it’s kind of fascinating that you’ve evolved into really thinking about indexing. ’cause when you’re, you were chairman of the Yale Endowment Investment Committee, David Swenson was famously the creator of the Yale model, and he had a lot of focus on private investment, on alternatives, on venture capital, hedge funds, as well as commodities. What made that era so different where those investments were so attractive then and apparently less attractive to you today? 00:22:02 [Speaker Changed] First you have to understand that David Swenson was a remarkably talented guy. He was the best PhD student at Jim Tobin Nobel Prize winner ever had. He was the first person to do an interest rate swap, which is the first derivative transaction that took place in this country between IBM and the World Bank. Which just to show you, everybody had told him, you’ll never be able to do that, David. So we’re talking about a very unusual guy. 00:22:33 And he was creative and disciplined in a remarkable combination. And he was the first person of size to get involved in a series of different types of investing. And then he very carefully chose the very best people in each of those different types. One day I was thinking, you know, he’s really done some very creative work. I wonder what’s his average length of relationship. Because the average length of relationship with most institutions was somewhere between two and a half and three and a half years. High turnover of managers, the calculation, it was 14 years on average and they were still running. So it’d probably be something like 20 years of typical relationship or duration, many of these managers when they were just getting started. So it’s the most dicey period in any investment organization. Very, very unusual and creative guy said to me after he’d been doing this for quite a long time, you know, the nature of creativity payoff is getting less and less and less because of everybody else’s doing what I’ve been doing. It’s not as rewarding as it used to be. And because I’ve been choosing managers and other people are trying to get into those same managers, they’re not as differentiated as they used to be. The rate of return magnitude that I’ve been able to accomplish 10 years ago, 15 years ago, I’m not gonna be able to do in 10 or 15 years into the future. And I think he was right. 00:24:10 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So how do you end up from going from the Yale Endowment to the Vanguard Board of Directors? Tell us where where that relationship came 00:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Completely different. Each one was doing what they were capable of doing really well. And Vanguard was focused on minimizing cost. And they really systematic at it different orientation. The orientation of the Yale endowment was to find managers and investment opportunities that were so different that you might get a higher rate of return. So attacking to reaching for higher and higher rate of return. Vanguard was reaching for lower and lower cost of executing a plain vanilla proposition. Index funds. Kanes once had somebody say, you’ve, you seem to have changed your mind. He said, yes, I, when the facts change, I do change my judgment. What do you do when the facts change? And the reality is we’ve been looking at a market that has changed and changed and changed and changed and the right way to deal with that market has therefore changed and changed and changed and changed then what you could have done in the early 1960s, you can’t do today. And what you should have done in the early sixties was go find an active manager who could knock the socks off at the competition. But it just, the competition is so damn good today that there isn’t a manager that can knock the socks off. 00:25:41 [Speaker Changed] And a quote from your book is, the grim reality is clear active investing is not able to keep up with, let alone outperform the market index. That’s the biggest change of the past 50 years, is that it’s become pretty obvious that the deck is used to be in favor of active managers. Now it seems to be very much stacked against them 00:26:06 [Speaker Changed] Because they’re so very good. It’s ironic, ironic, ironic. 00:26:10 [Speaker Changed] The paradox of skill. Yep. Huh. Really, really fascinating. You, you referenced some really interesting research in the book. One of the things I find fascinating is that research from Morningstar and DALBAR show that not only do investors tend to underperform the market, they underperform their own investments. Tell us about that. 00:26:36 [Speaker Changed] Because we’re human beings, as any behavioral economist would point out to you, we have certain beliefs and those beliefs tend to be very, very optimistic about our skills. And we think we can help ourself get better results, or at least to minimize the negative experiences. And the reality is that over time just doesn’t work out to be true. The average investor in an average year loses two full percent by making mistakes with the best of intentions, trying to do something really good for themselves. They make mistakes that are costly and that cost. Think about it, if you think the market’s gonna return something like six or 7%, you lose 2%, maybe two and a half, maybe three for inflation, call it two point a half. Whoop. That’s something down. Then you’ve got fees and costs. Gee was you add onto that if you did add on another 2% that you’ve made mistakes, you’re talking about a major transformation to the negative of what could have been your rate of return. 00:27:54 [Speaker Changed] Let’s put some, some numbers, some mean on that bone. You cite a uc Davis study that looked at 66,000 investor accounts from 1991 to 1996 over the that period, the market gained just under 18% a year, 17.9% a year. Investors had underperformed by 6.5% a year. They gave up a third of gains through mistakes, taxes, and costs. And then DALBAR does the same thing. And that’s where the two to 3% in a low return environment is. So how should investors think about this tendency to do worse than what the market does? 00:28:37 [Speaker Changed] Well in, in my view, and it’s part of the rethinking investing concept of the book, is if you find a problem that’s a repetitive problem, and this sure is attack the problem and try to reduce it. So what could you do to reduce the cost of behavioral economics? And the answer is index or ETF. And the reason why it would index or ETF would help is because it’s boring. Right? You know, if you own an index fund, you don’t get excited about what happened in the market as anything like you would get excited about if you had just had five stocks or if you had two or three mutual funds and you were tracking those mutual funds because they changed more. The market as a whole, it kind of goes along in its own lumbering way. A slow wide river of flow over time. And you, yeah, there’s nothing to get excited about. 00:29:40 So you leave it alone. Huh? You leave it alone and you leave it alone. And it’s a little bit like when your mother said, don’t pick it, that scab let it heal by itself. Well, but mom, it itches. You’d just be a little bit tolerant and don’t itch it or don’t scratch it and it’ll heal faster. And sure enough, mother was right In the same way, if you index, you won’t be excited by the same things that other people get excited by. Then you’ll just sort of steadily flow through and have all the good results come your way. That’s it. 00:30:14 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So first of all, I have to tell you, I, I love this book. It’s totally digestible. It’s barely a hundred pages. I literally read it over a cup of tea and, and you’ve published 20 books before this. What, first of all, what led to this very short format? Why, why go so brief? I’m curious, 00:30:39 [Speaker Changed] Barry. It’s really an interesting experience. But for me, I love helping people with investing and I keep trying to think of how can I be helpful and what are the lessons that my children, grandchildren ought to learn? What are the lots that my favorite institutions ought to learn, my local church, whatever it is now, what could I offer that would be helpful? And I thought to myself, you know, the world has changed a lot and some rethinking of what’s the right way to invest might turn out to be a good idea. I should try penciling that out. And the more I tried to scratch it out for the church investment committee, I realized this is something that could easily be used by virtually everybody else. There are some major changes that have taken place and the world of investing is very different than it used to be. And the right way to deal with the world is really different than it used to be. And I owe it to other people because I’ve been blessed with this wonderful privilege of being able to learn from all kinds of people what’s going on in an investment world and how to deal with it and add it all together. I should put this together in this one last short book. And my wife laughed and said, you never get this down to only a hundred pages. I think that’s all it takes. 00:32:04 [Speaker Changed] You got pretty close. I think it’s like a hundred and something, 102, 104. You, 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] You’re, you’re right there. Yeah. One of those pages is blank. And then there’s several pages that are half blank. So, 00:32:14 [Speaker Changed] Well I it it’s barely a hundred pages. So I, I love this quote from the book over the 20 years ending in mid 2023, investing in a broad based US total market equity fund produced net returns better than more than 90% of professionally managed stock funds that promised to beat the market. Really that’s the heart of, of the book, is that if you invest for 20 plus years, passive indexing, and we’ll talk about passive the phrase in a minute, but basic indexing ends up in the top decile. 00:32:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, you’re talking about 20 years in. Many people say, oh gee, that’s a long time. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You start investing in your twenties, you’ll still be investing in your eighties. That’s a 60 year horizon. And if you’re lucky enough to do well enough, you might leave some to your children and grandchildren. So it might not be 60 years, it might be 80, a hundred, 120 years. Wow. Try to think about that long term because that is a marvelous privilege to have that long a time to be able to be an investor. 00:33:27 [Speaker Changed] And you, you cite the s and p research group, spiva, the average annual return of broad indexes was 1.8 percentage points better than the average actively managed funds. That’s nearly 2% compounding over time. That really adds up, doesn’t it? It 00:33:44 [Speaker Changed] Sure does. And compounding is really important for all of us to recognize that. Some people call it snowball, and I think that’s perfectly fine because as you roll a snowball, every time you roll it over, it gets much thicker, not just a little bit, much thicker than you do compounding at one, two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty two, sixty four, a hundred twenty eight. Those last rounds of compounding are really important. So for goodness sake, think about how can you get there so you’ll have those compoundings work for you. 00:34:20 [Speaker Changed] So we mentioned the phrase passive, which has come, 00:34:24 [Speaker Changed] Oh, please don’t do that. Which 00:34:25 [Speaker Changed] Comes with some baggage. But you describe what a historical anomaly, the phrase passive is it it really, why? Why don’t I let you explain? It really just comes from an odd legal usage. Te tell us a little bit about where the word passive came to be when it came to indexing. Glad to the 00:34:44 [Speaker Changed] Indexing is, to me the right word to use. Passive has such a negative connotation. I dunno about you, Barry, but I wouldn’t want anybody to describe me as passive. I’m gonna vote for so-and-so as president of the United States. That’s not gonna be because he’s passive. Passive is a negative term. However, if you’re an electrical engineer, it’s not a pejorative. There’s two parts. There’s two prongs or three prongs on the end of a wire. And there’s a wall socket that’s got either two holes or three holes depending on which electric system you have. The one that has the prongs is called the active part. The one that has the holes is called the passive part. And because indexing was created by a group of electrical engineers and mechanical engineers, they just used what they thought was the sensible terminology. And then other people who had not realized where it came from, saw it as being a negative. I don’t want to be passive. I want to have an active manager who go out there and really do something for me. That is a complete misunderstanding. And it really did terrible harm for index investing to be called passive. 00:36:01 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about some of the other things that index investing has been called. And I put together a short list. ’cause there’s been so much pushback to indexing. It’s been called Marxist Communist Socialist. It’s devouring capitalism. It’s a mania. It’s creating frightening risk for markets. It’s lobotomized investing a danger to the economy, a systemic risk, a bubble waiting to burst. It’s terrible for our economy. Why so much hate for index then? Well, 00:36:35 [Speaker Changed] If you were an active manager and you were life threatened by something that was a better product at a lower cost, you might have some negative commentary too. 00:36:44 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s just as simple as their livelihood is dependent on flows into active, and that’s where all the animus comes from. 00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] And it’s, it’s partly livelihood. It’s partly religious faith. It’s partly cultural conviction. It’s partly what I’ve done for most of these people would say, I’ve been doing it for 25 years and I want to keep doing it for 25 years. Oh, by the way, I get paid really well to do it. And I like that job 00:37:08 [Speaker Changed] To continue. Sure. You mentioned, we talked earlier about the temptation, the, that we’re surrounded by temptations to be wrong. I want to talk about some data in the book about what happens if you are wrong and out of the market during some of the best days. And the data point you used was 10,000 trading days over 26 years on average. That’s about 11.2% returns. So if you have money in broad market indices over 26 years, 10,000 trading sections, you’re averaging 11.2% annually. If you miss only the 10 best days, not a year, but over those 10,000 trading days, that 11.2% drops to 9.2%, 20 days down, seven point to 7.7% a year. And if you miss the 30 best days out of 10,000, the return goes from 11.2 to 6.4, almost a 500 basis point drop. That’s amazing. Tell us about that. 00:38:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, first of all, you have to recognize when you select out the most extreme days, it does have a really big impact. The second thing is, when do those days come? And the best days usually come shortly after the worst days. Right? The bounce, the, Hey, wait a minute, this market is not as bad as everybody’s saying. It really does have terrific opportunity and that’s when the best days typically come. So the time that we all get frightened and all of us get unnerved is the wrong, the most wrong time to be taking action. 00:39:03 [Speaker Changed] And and the statistical basis is those 10 days are only 0.1% of total training sessions. But you’re giving up one fifth of the gains that that’s an amazing asymmetry 00:39:18 [Speaker Changed] And it’s a hell of a great lesson to learn. Hang in there steady. Eddie does pay off. 00:39:24 [Speaker Changed] Another quote from the book, why should investors care about the day-to- day or even month to month fluctuations in prices if they have no plans to sell anytime soon? That sounds so perfectly obvious when you hear it. Why are people so drawn into the noise? 00:39:42 [Speaker Changed] Well, when I advise people on investing, I always start with, what do you most want to accomplish? And then the second question is, when do you plan to sell your securities? And most people say, well, what do you mean when do I plan to sell? Well, when are you most likely to say, I need money out of my securities investment for life spending probably in retirement. Oh yeah. And then they’ll give you a date and then you say, and how far out into the future is that? And then really want to be difficult for somebody say, okay, that’s 43 years out into the future. Let’s go back 43 years. Tell me what you think was happening 43 years ago. Today’s date, 43 years ago. I have no idea. Why do you ask? Well, I’m asking because you have no idea and you have no idea 43 years into the future. And the reason for that is because you don’t care. It’s the long term trend that you care about and you care greatly about that. But you don’t care about the day to day to day fluctuations. 00:40:53 [Speaker Changed] So you, you sum up the book by pointing out every investor today has three great gifts, time compounding and ETF and indexing discuss 00:41:07 [Speaker Changed] Time to be able to have the experience of compounding where you each compounding round, you double what you had. Boy does it really pay off to benefit it for the long term and have saved early enough so that you compound a larger amount. But that leap from one to two is not very exciting. Two to four is not much. Four to eight’s, not really all that much. Eight to 16 starts to attract your attention. 16 to 32, that’s really something. 32 to 64 and to 128. Holy smokes. I want that last doubling. That’s really a payoff only way you get there. You start early and stay on course compounding away as best you can. 00:41:57 [Speaker Changed] You know, you, you people have pointed out, and I think you referenced this in the book, that as successful as Warren Buffet has been over his whole career because of the doubling, it depends on the rule of 72, but let’s say every seven or eight years, half of your gains have come in the most recent seven and a half, eight year era. And Warren’s now in his nineties, and the vast majority of his wealth have only happened in the past 10, 15 years. It’s kind of fascinating. 00:42:30 [Speaker Changed] Well, he’s a brilliant and wonderful human being, and all of us can learn great lessons from paying attention to what Warren says or has said. And his annual meetings are a treasure chest of opportunities to learn. But he did start as a teenager, not in his mid twenties, but in his early teens. And then he is not stopping at 65. He’s roaring right past that. And when you bolt on those extra years, it gives him a much larger playing field in which the double and double and redouble and redouble and all of us ought to pay attention to that one most powerful lesson. If you’ve got the time, the impact of compounding really is terrific. And the only way you get to be have the time is to do it yourself. Save enough early enough and stay with it long enough to let the compounding take place. But it’s inevitable. Power of compounding is just wonderful to have on your side. 00:43:34 [Speaker Changed] So three of the things I want to talk about from the book first, as alpha became harder and harder to achieve as it became more difficult to beat very good competition, the aspect of reducing costs, reducing fees, reducing taxes, became another way of generating better returns. Tell us a little bit about what led you to that conclusion and what firms like BlackRock and Vanguard have done to to further that belief system. 00:44:09 [Speaker Changed] Variance really candidly, just been pay attention to what the numbers say and pay attention to the data. And the data is so powerfully, consistently strong that active investing is a exciting idea. And in the right time and circumstance, the 1960s, it worked beautifully, but the circumstances now are so different that it doesn’t work beautifully. It works candidly, negatively, huh. 00:44:40 [Speaker Changed] Two other things I wanna go over. One is the concept of total financial portfolio. Meaning when you’re looking at your allocation, you should include the present value of your future social security payments and the equity value of your home as sort of bond-like. And that should help you shift your allocation a little away from bonds, a little more into equities. Tell us about that. 00:45:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think it’s one of those ideas that once it pops into your mind, you’ll never walk away from it. Most of us have no idea what the total value of our future stream of pay payouts from social security are. But you can do the calculation fairly simply. Most of us would be really impressed if they, if we realized how much is the real value of that future stream of payments that are coming from the best credit in the world. Federal government. Huh. So, and that’s inflation protected. So it’s even better than most people would imagine. That’s the single most valuable asset for most people. And the second most valuable asset for most people is the value of their home. And I know people would say their first reactions, but I’m not gonna sell my home. I’m gonna continue to live there. Fine, true. But someday either your children or your grandchildren will say, we don’t really wanna live in that same house, so we’re going to sell it. 00:46:08 So it does have an economic value. And it will be realized at some point down the line, take those two and put them side by side with your securities. And most people would say, my God, I’ve got more in the way of fixed income and fixed in bond equivalents than I had ever imagined. I think I ought to be careful in my securities part of the portfolio to rethink things and probably be substantially more committed to equities in my securities portfolio because I’ve got these other things that I was never counting on before. But now that I’ve been told about it, I really want to include that as my understanding to the total picture. 00:46:50 [Speaker Changed] And, and I like the concept of outside the market decisions versus inside the market decisions. Explain the difference between the two. 00:47:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, outside market decisions have to do with what’s changed in your life. Most obvious being when you retire, but sometimes it’s when you get a better job and a higher pay, or even you get a signif significant bonus because of the wonderful achievement that you’d had during the particular year when your circumstances get changed. Oh, and getting married is another real change. When the circumstances change, you really ought to rethink your investment program just to be sure that it’s really right for your present total picture, 00:47:38 [Speaker Changed] Ma. Makes a lot of sense. I know I only have you for a few more minutes. Let me jump to three of my favorite questions that I ask all my guests. Starting with, what are some of your favorite books? What are you reading right now? 00:47:54 [Speaker Changed] My favorite books tend to be history. And the one that I’ve most recently read is a wonderful biography of Jack Kennedy as President and the things that he did that made America the most popular country in the world. 00:48:13 [Speaker Changed] And our last two questions. What advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in investing? 00:48:21 [Speaker Changed] Think about what really motivates you to be interested in investing. If it’s because it’s a high income field, that’s okay, but candidly, it’s not an inspiration and you only have one life to lead Is, is it your desire to lead your life making money or doing something that you would say was at the end of your life, I’m so proud of, have what I did, or I’m so glad I did what I did. If you’re thinking about investing because it’s a profession where you help people be more successful at achieving their objectives, then candidly, you could have a fabulous time. It won’t come because you beat the market, but that’s not the problem for most people. For most people, beating the market is very clearly secondary to what’s their real need, which is to think through what are their objectives, what are their financial resources, and how can they put those together into the best for them Investment program. And the same thing is true for every college, every hospital, every college, church, every organization that has an endowment needs to think carefully about what is the real purpose of the money and how can we do the best for our long-term success by the structure of the portfolio that we have. 00:49:44 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today that would’ve been really useful back in the 1960s when you were working for the Rockefellers? 00:49:55 [Speaker Changed] Oh boy. First that the whole world is gonna be changing. So don’t stay with what you think is really great about the early 1960s because all of that is gonna be upended and all the lessons that you would think were just great about how to do things in the early 1960s. We’ll work against you then. By the time you get to the this time of the year, you’ll be making mistakes, one after another, after another, after another by doing things that are just completely out of date. And the world of investing will change more than most fields will change. Computer technology will change more. Airplane travel will change more. But candidly, investing is gonna change so much that if you take the lessons that you’re learning for how to do it in the sixties and try to transport those into the 2000 and twenties, you’re gonna pay a terrible price. Don’t do it. Don’t do it. 00:50:55 [Speaker Changed] Thank you, Charlie, for sharing all of your wisdom and insights. I really greatly appreciate it.

Elon Musk’s DOGE layoffs could impact more than just federal workers. They pose a growing risk to the economy, one prominent economist says. According to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, the number of jobs cut could number 1 million because federal contractors are also likely to take a hit. People who work on government contracts comprise more than two-thirds of the overall federal workforce. And while President Donald Trump frequently points to the stock market’s performance as an indicator of his success, Slok and others are warning about the prospect of a market correction in the wake of Trump’s policies. Apple CEO Tim Cook Apple said it will invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including plans to build a new factory in Houston and add 20,000 jobs, just days after CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump. The factory will be used to manufacture servers the company plans to deploy to support its artificial intelligence platform, Apple Intelligence. Berkshire Hathaway stock rallied to an all-time high Monday after a strong fourth-quarter earnings report, enriching CEO Warren Buffett’s net worth by $6 billion. Berkshire, which one analyst called “an attractive stock in an uncertain macro environment,” surpassed Tesla to become the seventh-most valuable public American company. President Donald Trump said on Monday that the planned 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are “on time” and “on schedule” to be enacted early next month after being delayed for 30 days. Trump added that the tariffs would make the U.S. “extremely liquid and rich again,” though economists have warned they could have negative impacts. The price of Bitcoin slid below the $90,000 mark on Tuesday, down nearly 7.5% from the previous 24 hours and dropping to its lowest level since mid-November. The token’s value has fallen more than 19% since it hit an all-time high of $109,114 on the day of Trump’s inauguration last month. Dan Bongino Dan Bongino is President Donald Trump’s pick for Deputy FBI Director, a position that does not require Senate approval. In addition to earnings from his podcast and radio show, Bongino has a nearly $160 million stake in Rumble, the conservative-leaning video platform that pitches itself as a free speech alternative to YouTube. In addition to his $1 million base salary as CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group last year, former Republican congressman Devin Nunes also received a $600,000 bonus, $44.1 million in stock awards and $1.2 million in additional stock compensation. His 2024 compensation marks a 6,200% increase from the $750,000 he earned in 2023, despite Trump Media seeing a net loss of $401 million last year, according to an SEC filing. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) Congressional negotiations to avoid a government shutdown appear to have reached an impasse as Democrats suggest they could withhold their votes in protest of President Donald Trump’s and Elon Musk’s broad spending cuts to congressionally appropriated funds. The current spending plan expires on March 14, and Republicans, facing an even thinner House majority, have previously relied on Democratic votes to pass a deal. MORE: Nearly $1 trillion in potential cuts to Medicaid have divided the GOP ahead of an expected vote Tuesday on a spending blueprint that would kickstart the legislative process for enacting Trump’s policy agenda. The fiscal year 2025 spending plan would likely lead to about $800 billion in cuts over the next decade from Medicaid, which provides health care coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The Trump Administration is reportedly backing down on a threat to fire workers who don’t respond to Elon Musk’s directive asking them to say what they did last week after several agency heads, including FBI Director Kash Patel and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, told their employees not to respond. Though Trump defended the email plan, his administration informed federal agencies that it is now “voluntary” for employees to respond to Musk’s email and they will not be fired if they do not, according to the New York Times. Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIX. The Philadelphia Eagles are planning to visit the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory if they are invited, according to multiple reports, following backlash on social media from right-wing users who bashed the team over claims it planned to skip the tradition. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has reportedly criticized President Donald Trump in the past, saying in a private meeting with NFL team owners in 2018 that Trump’s first presidency was “disastrous,” according to the New York Times. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes TOPLINE Many of America’s best-known and most dynamic tech companies are among the top employers for folks on H-1B visas, from Amazon to Microsoft and Google, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security. “It’s more than an immigration policy,” biotech billionaire and Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong recently told Forbes. The South African immigrant came to Los Angeles as a surgical resident in 1980 and says these visas are “living proof of the American dream in action.” Elon Musk, the nation’s most famous immigrant today, is another huge fan of H-1Bs, and his electric vehicle company, Tesla, is now among the top 25 U.S. employers using such visas, the first time it appears in the ranks. Created in 1990, the H-1B visa was designed to spur immigration of talented workers like scientists, engineers and educators. The temporary visa, which lasts up to three years and can be renewed, quickly became a popular hiring tool in Silicon Valley. For years, the number of visas awarded annually—via a lottery system—varied, ranging from 48,600 new visas issued in 1992 to 163,600 in 2001. Since 2006, the cap has been fixed at 85,000 annually—20,000 of which are reserved for foreign workers who obtain a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. university. By Forbes’ count, roughly 12% of American billionaires are immigrants, but only a handful benefited personally from an H-1B visa early in their career here. They include Jeff Skoll, the Canadian engineer who was eBay’s first president, Eric Yuan, the Chinese-born founder and CEO of Zoom, and Jayshree Ullal, the CEO of computer networking firm Arista Networks who was born in London and raised in India. WHY IT MATTERS “H-1B visas have become the recent subject of political debate. Advocates such as Elon Musk have defended the program, lauding its ability to drive innovation and recruit highly specialized talent, while other political figures, including Steve Bannon, worry that it undercuts American workers,” says Forbes contributor Julie Goldenberg. “But we found a handful of immigrant billionaires who got their start with the help of an H-1B. And many of the biggest tech companies in the country rely on these visas to hire highly skilled workers.” MORE Immigrant Tech Workers Scrambling To Secure Visas Ahead Of Trump’s Inauguration Tax filing season is off to a sluggish start, IRS data shows, amid federal turmoil that has impacted the agency.

The Spiritans have paid out €8.8 million to 125 abuse survivors, including former pupils of Blackrock College in Dublin and other schools run by the religious order. The figure includes €3.4 million paid in settlements to 52 abuse survivors who have come forward since RTÉ broadcast its Blackrock Boys radio documentary in November 2022. This figure does not include legal costs. The documentary involved interviews with David Ryan and his late brother Mark who were abused at Blackrock College and its preparatory school, Willow Park. A total of 58 people have made claims against the Spiritans since the documentary was broadcast, with 52 addressed to date. Between 1998 and November 2022 the congregation paid €5.4 million in settlements to 73 survivors. That figure also does not include legal fees. It involves litigation cases brought against the Spiritans’ Irish Province between 1998 and 2022, as well as a small number of actions from other jurisdictions, mainly in the United States and UK, which fall under the responsibility of the Irish Province. By November of last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including the 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published last September. A further 12 survivors came forward subsequently. The report disclosed allegations against 67 alleged abusers at Spiritan-run schools, including Blackrock College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. [ How religious orders are sitting on assets worth hundreds of millions of euroOpens in new window ] There were 130 allegations made against 24 alleged abusers at Willow Park and 55 allegations against 13 alleged abusers at Blackrock College. There were 60 allegations relating to 18 alleged abusers at Rockwell College, with 32 allegations against six alleged abusers at St Mary’s in Rathmines. There were 10 allegations against four alleged abusers at St Michael’s in Ballsbridge, and five allegations against two alleged abusers at Templeogue College. A further 37 allegations were made against Spiritans not connected to any school. Meanwhile, 171 survivors have, to date, engaged with the Spiritan restorative justice programme – a listening, support and healing process which includes counselling and face-to-face meetings with the Spiritan leadership team. Those incidents of sexual abuse by Spiritans were among 2,395 allegations at 308 schools run by the religious orders, as recorded in the scoping inquiry report. [ Commission of investigation into abuse in schools ‘a priority’ for new governmentOpens in new window ] Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said “a high-level interdepartmental group” was “working intensively” in preparing terms of reference for the commission of investigation into schools, as recommended in the scoping inquiry report. The group includes “high-level representation from several Government departments” and was “working closely with the Office of the Attorney General and has sought expert advice where appropriate”. The spokesperson said the issues were “complex” but it was desirable the commission be “robust, and has the necessary powers to compel witnesses and documents, and so that it can complete its work in a reasonable time frame”. It is expected to report “shortly” to Minister for Education Helen McEntee. Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Hubert Horan: Can Uber Ever Deliver? Part Thirty-Five: What Drove Uber’s Recent $8 Billion P&L Improvement?

Yves here. Hubert Horan summarizes the state of play with Uber after 2024. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016. Horan has no financial links with any urban car service industry competitors, investors or regulators, or any firms that work on behalf of industry participants. Uber and Lyft both reported full year GAAP profits for 2024. Both companies reported their 2024 financials earlier this month. After correcting the results for known issues, this paper will explain how Uber achieved an $8 billion P&L improvement after losing $33 billion in its first 13 years. It will also discuss the huge divergence in Uber/Lyft stock performance, and why neither stock improved after releasing strong 2024 P&L results. It will also cover why autonomous vehicles—a business both companies abandoned—have once again become a major focus. Uber Is Earning Small Profits but Continues to Mislead Investors About its Financial Performance Uber had an operating profit of $2.8 billion and an operating margin of 6.4% in 2024. This was up from $1.1 billion (3.0%) in 2023, the first year Uber ever reported profits. It reported a 2024 net profit of $9.8 billion (22.4% margin; up from $1.9 billion (5.1%) in 2023) but, as will be discussed below, badly misrepresents the actual 2024 performance of its ongoing operations As this series has documented, Uber includes multi-billion dollar items in its quarterly/annual operating results that have nothing to do with the current performance of ongoing business operations, and makes no effort to lay out the actual P&L of ongoing operations. Uber’s most dubious practice is including its estimate of the changes of value in untradeable securities it received after shutting down operations that had been hopelessly unprofitable These include shares in larger companies that had driven Uber out of the market (Didi in China, Yandex in Russia, Grab in Southeast Asia) and in Aurora, which acquired Uber’s failed autonomous vehicle development efforts. This practice dates to its IPO prospectus, when it used the alleged appreciation of untradeable securities to inflate its bottom-line 2018 profitability by $5 billion, in the hope of creating the impression of robust, rapidly improving profitability. [1] Uber’s 2024 and 2023 “net profitability” were each inflated by $1.8 billion thanks to the claimed value of paper associated with discontinued operations. $6.4 billion of Uber’s fourth quarter 2024 bottom line was due a tax valuation release. Thanks to Uber’s staggering 2010-23 losses (over $33 billion) it had deferred tax assets it could not report until there was some reasonably likelihood of positive income to offset. Uber claims it has over $41 billion in deferred tax assets, primarily from net operating losss carryforwards, research and development credits and from fixed and intangible assets where the tax basis exceeds book value.[2] Presumably Uber’s 4Q 24 $6.4 billion claim accords with IRS regulations. The issue is how investors are supposed to interpret Uber’s 2024 P&L. Its SEC filings include a one sentence footnote mentioning the tax valuation release but do not explain where it came from, what specific events triggered the 4Q 24 claim, why it was $6.4 billion, or whether investors should expect similar tax asset impacts in the future. And while Uber could not report the $6.4 billion until specific criteria had been met, it obviously has nothing to do with Uber’s 4Q 24 business performance. Uber faced a similar problem when it recorded $5 billion in stock based compensation expense as a 2Q 19 event, even though it covered work performed over multiple years. Then, as now, Uber’s published financials made no attempt to isolate these items so investors could not determine the true P&L results for current periods. The graph above illustrates the gap between Uber’s reported net profit margin, and a net margin corrected to only include items related to its ongoing business operations during the reported time period. Uber overstated current P&L performance by 18 points in 2024 and 5 points in 2023, and overtime Uber rendered GAAP net profitability meaningless for any investor that was trying to track profit improvement over time. Even when Uber was producing massive losses its P&L did not have the huge volatility that its reported numbers suggested. Uber produced meaningless GAAP net profit numbers because they wanted investors and other outsiders to focus on its even more bogus “Adjusted EBITDA Profitability” metric, which measures neither EBITDA nor profitability.[3] Since 2019 Uber has excluded over $21 billion of expenses from this “EBITDA Profitability” metric other than interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This practice allows Uber PR to claim a “profit margin” 10-12 points higher than its corrected GAAP net margin in the last three years. Prior to the pandemic when Uber was desperate to mask how far the company was from GAAP breakeven it was claiming a profit margin 24-32 points higher. This PR strategy has been successful. Media and financial analyst reports almost exclusively evaluate Uber profitability based on the bogus “Adjusted EBITDA Profitability” and only mention reported GAAP net profits in passing. Additionally, Uber’s SEC reporting is designed to make it impossible for outsiders to determine what drove observed changes to bottom line results. Uber only publishes a single demand metric (“trips”) making it impossible to determine the relative growth rates by product (car services and food delivery) or geographic markets or to determine how unit costs and unit revenues have changed. This measure does not distinguish between a 10 block trip and a 50 mile trip. Uber also makes it very difficult to evaluate changes in how gross customer payments are split between Uber and its drivers. A first approximation of driver revenue can be gleaned by subtracting “Uber Revenue” from “Gross Revenue” but most driver bonuses and incentive payments are buried within Uber’s “Cost of Revenue” and “Sales and Marketing” expense lines. Uber also never isolated expenses related to potential future lines of business (e.g. autonomous vehicles, freight, flying cars) so one could not accurately identify the cost of its current operations. While Miniscule, 2024 Saw Lyft’s First-Ever Reported Profit. Lyft had a small operating loss ($112 million, negative 2% margin) in 2024 but eked out a $22 million net profit (0% margin). This was a notable year-over-year improvement. It had a negative 8% operating margin and a negative 12% margin in 2023. Lyft’s SEC reporting is less opaque than Uber’s, and car services are its only business. The overwhelmingly biggest factor driving its year-over-year P&L improvement was that it managed to increase its share of gross customer payments from 32% to 36%. This was a labor to capital wealth transfer of $634 million. Lyft’s revenue per trip increased by 12% while gross driver receipts per trip fell by 6%. As will be discussed below Lyft’s 2024 improvements mimic gains Uber achieved in 2022. Had this “take rate” not improved, Lyft would have lost twice as much money as they did in 2023 and had a negative 12% net margin Lyft conducted a major cost reduction program in late 2022, and 2023 costs per ride fell 26%. But these impacts seem to have dissipated as 2024 unit costs increased by 4%. Three Major Changes Drove Uber’s $8 Billion Annual 2019-2024 Profit Turnaround As discussed above, reported net earnings are useless for analyzing how Uber’s performance has changed over time due and must be corrected to eliminate major distortions (which significantly inflated net earnings in 2018,21,23 and 24 and depressed them somewhat in 2022 and 22) and accounting timing problems (which badly understated 2019 earnings and significantly overstated 2024 earnings). The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. ($ billions) 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 Reported Net Income [4] ($4,033) $997 ($496) ($9,142) $1,887 Reported Net Margin 9% (60%) (29%) 5% 22% After eliminating discontinued ops and Timing issues Corrected Oper Income (3,424) (6,115) (1,832) 1,110 2,799 Corrected Oper Margin (30%) (43%) (6%) 3% 6% Corrected Net Income (5,338) (6,025) (1,929) 73 2,022 Corrected Net Margin (47%) (43%) (6%) 0% 5% Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

Lyft had a small operating loss ($112 million, negative 2% margin) in 2024 but eked out a $22 million net profit (0% margin). This was a notable year-over-year improvement. It had a negative 8% operating margin and a negative 12% margin in 2023. Lyft’s SEC reporting is less opaque than Uber’s, and car services are its only business. The overwhelmingly biggest factor driving its year-over-year P&L improvement was that it managed to increase its share of gross customer payments from 32% to 36%. This was a labor to capital wealth transfer of $634 million. Lyft’s revenue per trip increased by 12% while gross driver receipts per trip fell by 6%. As will be discussed below Lyft’s 2024 improvements mimic gains Uber achieved in 2022. Had this “take rate” not improved, Lyft would have lost twice as much money as they did in 2023 and had a negative 12% net margin Lyft conducted a major cost reduction program in late 2022, and 2023 costs per ride fell 26%. But these impacts seem to have dissipated as 2024 unit costs increased by 4%. Three Major Changes Drove Uber’s $8 Billion Annual 2019-2024 Profit Turnaround As discussed above, reported net earnings are useless for analyzing how Uber’s performance has changed over time due and must be corrected to eliminate major distortions (which significantly inflated net earnings in 2018,21,23 and 24 and depressed them somewhat in 2022 and 22) and accounting timing problems (which badly understated 2019 earnings and significantly overstated 2024 earnings). The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. ($ billions) 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 Reported Net Income [4] ($4,033) $997 ($496) ($9,142) $1,887 Reported Net Margin 9% (60%) (29%) 5% 22% After eliminating discontinued ops and Timing issues Corrected Oper Income (3,424) (6,115) (1,832) 1,110 2,799 Corrected Oper Margin (30%) (43%) (6%) 3% 6% Corrected Net Income (5,338) (6,025) (1,929) 73 2,022 Corrected Net Margin (47%) (43%) (6%) 0% 5% Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price.

The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data.

One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually.

The figure breaking down the P&L over time shows that Uber has become profitable based on the author’s adjustments in ’24. From the tone of the article, I was expecting some negative earnings bomb based on the lead-in. I can tell you with certainty that the Wall Street models are backing out all of Uber’s balance sheet and income statement esoterica to derive the same figures the author shows here. There was a strong bear case against Uber ever becoming profitable in ’21-22, and those people have essentially been proven incorrect, all accounting dodginesss aside, and anyone who was short the stock felt a ton of pain. The discussion of the labor-capital dynamic required to make that shift is, to me, a separate discussion from Uber’s dubious practices in how they represent profits. Investors have sadly not pushed them enough to remove some obfuscations, but again, a separate issue for me than the core one at hand of how profitable Uber is as a business. The other part glossed over is that drivers will often work for both Lyft and Uber taking whichever fare is best, at least in large markets. Obviously in smaller markets, Uber is more dominant being so much larger than Lyft, but those are typically places where, at least in the States, there were no meaningful taxi presence pre-ride sharing. So whatever maintenance is being paid by the drivers, that overhead is covering the cost of collecting fares from both companies, not just one. In big metros like NYC where I’m based, nearly every driver takes rides from either service interchangeably. Far be it from me to defend Uber, but I think it’s worth bearing those two things in mind. Like it or not (I personally avoid Uber if possible, and generally try to use public transit or take Lyft or a cab when I must) Uber is now a real, profitable business, and barring some unionization/regulatory changes to the industry it’s likely to remain so in the future. So going forward this pig will have the confidence to ditch the lipstick (accounting shenanigans) it used for years to punch above its attractiveness class? Will it now face the world unembelllished and unadorned? It may be a real, profitable business now but the reality is the narrative Uber ran with to seduce investors into shovelling money into its coffers hasn’t been realized. I vividly remember the pitch being about replacing car ownership entirely (with the company saying their TAM was the entire global urban mobility market), that part has entirely disappeared from its story and they failed in sweeping competitors off the deck in several key markets. Maybe i’m being a little harsh, perhaps the glass half full version is that they shot for the stars and landed on the moon. Yes, basically. This piece reads like the bear cases from 3-4 years ago but fails to adequately acknowledge how things have changed. That doesn’t make it bad; on the contrary I think the analysis and fact finding is quite good, which is why I engaged and left a comment. There’s certainly a battle to be fought over the labor-capital dynamic in Uber and nearly every other large multinational on Earth, but I worry about whether the percieved disconnect between the facts and the tone of this takedown are doing a service to that movement. Thanks for the continued reporting on Uber. Something tells me that one day that you would like to report the final death throes of Uber and gather all your essays into a book ready to print about all the shenanigans that kept this unkillable monster going for so long. I was thinking the other day that Ed Zitron is to OpenAI what Hubert Horan is to Uber. I read Ed’s latest – There Is No AI Revolution – https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/ Hubert’s articles on Uber popped in mind especially when I read the parts of about how OpenAI is continually losing money and is essentially subsidizing free and paid subscribers. I figured eventually investment into UBER by the big players was the attractiveness of the deregulation and wreckage of labor rights that followed wherever the company touched down. The throwing money at AI that is losing money…the long game is coming into focus as the games in DC and with other governments are played out. Always enjoy these as the magicians tricks are so interesting – as brazen disregard of conventions are awarded more and more often – in so many arenas – to benefit a few. Isn’t one of Ubers and Lyfts primary risks interest rates? Not for themselves but for their drivers and their ability to secure new vehicles at a lower cost – which also provide warranty repairs – for a time? There doesn’t seem any capture of “fleet age” and I wonder as time passes whether the cars being used will be older and less mechanically sound and more grungy. Another apparent profitability ploy by Uber, anyway, is reduction in customer service levels. A recent personal experience highlighted this when there the help funnel led to no way to report algorithmic errors, only driver, vehicle or safety complaints. And there was zero way to back out once a path was selected, nor any way to actually interact with a person, let alone an AI agent to discuss the problem. Whi I felt purposely and intentionally trapped. And resorting to X/Twitter was also of no use as my issue was immediatky dismissed (with a nice apology of how much they care) but no offer of appeasement as I had experienced before. This is all market power in action, I suppose. “-to benefit a few” Nowadays my pmc adjacent contacts have their hair on fire about elon when they continue to be all in on autonomous this or that predating on anything they can get their grubbies on… from the above… Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. First they came for the gypsies… Uber’s business model is built around skirting a number of laws and regulations that protect its customers and its quasi-emploees. I’d rather pay the rentier “licence holders” or “medallion holders” than set foot in an Uber. Same goes for Lyft and AirBnB. Thank you. I had been wondering about this and hoping for an update. They do seem to have become profitable, albeit not by nearly as much as their results suggest and not to a level that would make them a particularly attractive investment. Still, it’s more than I expected given the previous columns. What I’m not sure about is why Uber has been able to maintain dominance despite no longer offering a cost advantage (I don’t know this for sure but it seems to be the case anecdotally, and the article appears to confirm it). Part 2 of the series argued that Uber has a higher cost structure than traditional operators and that there are no economies of scale to be had, and predicted that Uber would have to stop lowballing and give up its price advantage – which appears to have happened now. So what’s stopping competitors from simply undercutting them on price and gaining market share that way? Is it a de facto cartel situation where nobody wants to attract Uber’s ire, and so they all price match? Or does Uber have enough of a brand now that customers are just willing to pay more for the name, a la Coke? Your email address will not be published.

Title: 5 accessories to supercharge your Arduino projects

With their cheap price tags, massive I/O provisions, and low power consumption, microcontrollers like the uber-popular Arduino family have diverse use cases, from simple automation projects to full-on DIY robots and complex electronics circuits. While you can technically run a handful of useful scripts on your MCUs, their utility goes up a notch once you pair them with sensors, breadboards, and a host of other peripherals. But if you’re just starting out, here’s a quick list of the most useful components for your Arduino boards. From DIY 3D printers to FPV drones, there's a lot you could do with your Arduino microcontroller Often mistaken for microcontrollers by beginners, SBCs are more powerful than their MCU brethren. Rather than being featured in DIY plans involving heavy circuitry, Single-Board Computers are often used in computing and programming projects. But that doesn’t change the fact that these tiny boards can enhance the functionality of your Arduino-based tinkering ideas. For instance, you can pair your custom-built gamepad with a retro gaming war machine of an SBC. Alternatively, you can turn your tiny computing board into a Home Assistant hub and pair it with your arsenal of microcontrollers to automate every aspect of your living space. Heck, if you’re unable to access your PC, you can even turn a makeshift Raspberry Pi laptop into a dedicated Arduino programming machine! If you want to dabble in circuit components without soldering everything onto your microcontroller, you’ll have a blast with breadboards. For the uninitiated, breadboards let you interface your microcontrollers with motors, sensors, and other electronic equipment in temporary setups. Besides helping you test prototypes of your wacky Arduino ideas, breadboards ensure your components can be reused once you’re done building a project. Want to build a complex circuit-based project with your SBC or microcontroller? Breadboards can make your life a lot easier! You’ll also need some jumper cables to interface the different parts of your Arduino project with the breadboard. While certain boards, like the Uno series, need a male-to-female wire, others, such as the members of the Nano family, can be directly plugged into the breadboard. Likewise, you may need male-to-male cables for the sensor modules. Ideally, you’d want to grab a set of different jumper wires, so you’re well-equipped to work on any project. While breadboards are perfect for testing your boards, sometimes, the situation calls for a more drastic, soldering approach. Perhaps you want to design compact circuits that don’t take up half your workbench. Or maybe your sensor modules won’t work unless you hardwire the different pins onto the ICs. A soldering kit is quite handy in these situations. While it may seem a bit intimidating at first, most consumer-grade solder equipment is fairly easy to work with, and with enough practice, you’ll be hardwiring your Arduino projects in no time! Capable of creating fully-customized parts for your DIY projects, a 3D printer is an amazing investment for any Arduino lover. Whether it’s mechanical components for your robotics projects, cases to safeguard your Arduino from accidental spills, or random decorations to cheer you on while you spend hours tinkering with MCUs, a 3D printer can make them all. Unfortunately, your wallet won’t be the only casualty when buying a 3D printer. If you want to design precise components for your Arduino setups, you’ll have to sink quite a bit of time into learning a CAD utility. Finally, your Arduino toolkit will be incomplete if you don't purchase some sensor and circuit modules. After all, you can’t build a precise weather station without a BME280, DHT22, DS18B20, or another temperature sensor. Likewise, ultrasonic and IR modules are indispensable for robotics projects. For folks into electrical circuits, you can stock up on resistors, LEDs, and capacitors. But if you’re into automation, it’s a good idea to grab a couple of motors and relay modules for your tiny microcontroller. Really, the sky’s the limit when it comes to inexpensive MCU add-ons! Your palm-sized Raspberry Pi can help you keep tabs on the temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity values of your surroundings If you’re still looking for other cool accessories to add to your Arduino collection, I’ve got a couple of recommendations. Multimeters and potentiometers can come in handy for your circuitry projects. You’ve also got terminal shields and breakout boards, which can extend the functionality of your Arduino. Then there's the Arduino MCU itself, and you'll be surprised at the sheer number of models circulating in the market. Heck, you can even save a few bucks by going with a third-party board, though you might end up with cheap components if you play the clone roulette. We want to hear from you!

Title: Elon Musk hates OpenAI's for-profit transformation plan. He's not the only one.

Time Published: 2025-02-25T10:00:02Z

Sam Altman is attempting a thorny maneuver, transforming OpenAI from a subsidiary of a convoluted nonprofit into a more conventional business. Jungwon Byun knows what that's like. In 2023, the organization Byun cofounded, an AI lab named Ought, went through a similar transition. Launched in 2018, Ought built AI research tools and was structured as a nonprofit because its cofounders didn't expect AI to be commercially viable anytime soon, Byun said in an interview. Then ChatGPT launched, AI mania took hold, and the leadership team realized their structure might be a hindrance to raising capital and pursuing their mission. The decision was made to spin out Ought's core product, Elicit, as a for-profit company, along with most of its staff. Byun and several other executives set to lead the independent Elicit recused themselves from discussions, and a firm specializing in asset valuations was hired to independently appraise the value of Elicit so the remaining nonprofit, Ought, could be paid appropriately. (Byun declined to share the exact price, though she said Elicit chose to pay a premium on top of the recommended price.) OpenAI's planned transformation is on a far grander scale but faces similar questions and potentially more gnarly challenges. Altman wants to extricate OpenAI's revenue-generating business from its nonprofit parent, creating a more traditional company that can take in investments and give stock to shareholders who expect big returns. The process is complicated by OpenAI's complex corporate structure, the billions of dollars it has already raised from investors, and Elon Musk's attempts to block the deal. It's not just Musk though. A growing chorus of critics, including entrepreneurs, other companies and charities, investors, academics, and activists, say OpenAI may be about to make a grave mistake. Byun is one of them. "Artificial general intelligence is the most transformative technology of our lifetime, and OpenAI is absolutely at the frontier and one of the most important players in that," she told Business Insider. "So I think giving up governance rights to controlling the most important technology of our lifetime is an insanely huge decision and will affect all of humanity at a very great scale for a long time." Her advice to OpenAI's charitable parent organization: Do not sell to anyone. "I don't know, obviously, the details of what pressures they're under and what the details are of the options they're considering and how it affects the mission," Byun said. "But from what I can see, I absolutely would not sell those governance rights or give them up." OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment over the past week. OpenAI was established as a nonprofit in 2015. Over time, its need for capital to pay for AI development prompted it to establish a for-profit subsidiary to raise venture funding and pursue business partnerships and revenue-generating products. This and various other subsidiaries are controlled by the nonprofit, which is controlled by a board of directors chaired by Bret Taylor, alongside Altman, Fidji Simo, Larry Summers, and other business luminaries. The board's main legal obligation is to further the nonprofit's charitable mission, which is to build "safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity," rather than delivering returns to shareholders. OpenAI now seeks to transition to a more conventional corporate structure, turning the for-profit subsidiary into an independent public benefit company that controls "OpenAI's operations and business." PBCs are relatively common. This approach takes into account the interests of shareholders, other stakeholders, and the public. OpenAI has said that with investors taken care of, this will help the startup raise "necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space." OpenAI said the remaining nonprofit would receive shares in the public benefit company "at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors." That may be the ultimate challenge — and one made more complex by potential conflicts of interest. OpenAI investors and others focused on the startup's business-focused future may prefer to pay the nonprofit less for its assets and control, leaving the new for-profit entity with more financial firepower. However, some of these people could be in positions to influence the valuation and decision-making. Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who acrimoniously split from Altman, has sued the startup over its plans. Musk and a group of other investors also made a bid in February to acquire the nonprofit parent OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. That was more than half of the total value of the entire startup based on its most recent funding round. "It is in the public's interest to ensure that OpenAI, Inc. is compensated at fair market value," the Musk consortium said in a statement. "That value cannot be determined by insiders negotiating on both sides of the same table." Ellen Aprill, an expert on charities at the UCLA School of Law, said OpenAI's board has an obligation to make sure the nonprofit is getting a fair value for giving up its assets and control. "One of the very big issues is what is fair market value?" she told BI. "In particular, how much should the nonprofit get for giving up control? "Part of what Musk and his group were trying to do with this offer is to set at least some floor, some sense of what the fair market value would be," she added. "Putting it out for auction — let's see what people would pay." Taylor, the OpenAI board chairman, officially rebuffed Musk. "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," Taylor wrote in a statement. "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity." Days earlier, Altman shot the bid down with a post on X that mocked the struggles of the Musk-owned social network: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want." Altman's post prompted some discussion of whether he was, or should be, recused from this process. "When it comes to looking at a conflicted transaction like this one, it's much easier to satisfy the court's review if you take people who are on both sides of their transaction out of the negotiations," said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. However, he noted that under Delaware law, Altman isn't legally required to remove himself. Molk also cautioned against recusing too early. "There's value in his being there. Along the way, he can provide useful insight and information that's actually useful for OpenAI, for the nonprofit, if they're going to go ahead with that process," Molk said. "You want to try and strike a balance that allows them to do their job, that helps a transaction occur in a way that's actually beneficial to all parties, but then have them take themselves out of the picture once you're beyond that point." The existing for-profit parts of OpenAI have already raised billions of dollars in pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which the startup defines as systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. This has raised hackles among some consumer advocates. Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog, has repeatedly assailed the AI startup, accusing it of betraying its nonprofit mission. "The nonprofit board has behaved as a subordinate to the for-profit, and has done nothing that evidences any commitment to the nonprofit mission," said Robert Weissman, the copresident of Public Citizen. He argued that the solution is to forcibly dissolve the nonprofit and auction off its assets for the benefit of a new independent charity not linked to the current OpenAI board. Meta, Facebook's parent company, raised similar concerns, writing to California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, in December to ask him to step in. "Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission," the company wrote. "Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains." In late January, a group of 25 charities, including one started by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, piled on. The coalition urged Bonta "to take prompt legal action to ensure that OpenAI's assets are not illegally diverted for private gain." Rose Chan Loui, a law professor at UCLA specializing in nonprofit and philanthropy law, is skeptical of the legal justifications for OpenAI's plan. She said the proposed changes would amount to a change in purpose for OpenAI's current nonprofit. To do that under Delaware law requires one of four criteria to be met: "We don't think any of those apply here," Chan Loui said. "We keep going back to — your purpose is not to be first in the race to AGI. Your purpose is to make sure that AGI is to protect, and ensure safe development of AGI." OpenAI's existing structure — a nonprofit that controls a for-profit subsidiary — is unusual, but by no means unheard of. The Mozilla Foundation, for example, owns a tech company, Mozilla Corporation, that produces the Firefox internet browser. "Nonprofit organizations can not only coexist with commercial enterprises but also challenge them to do better," a Mozilla spokesperson said in a statement. "Nonprofit commitments provide the kind of public interest compass we don't see enough of in tech." Another parallel comes from the healthcare sector. In the 1990s, in the face of mounting financial pressure, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association allowed its affiliated nonprofit plan organizations to transition to for-profit businesses. Many subsequently did so, to the chagrin of some. "The mission of the nonprofit in most Blue Cross Blue Shield plans was to provide affordable, accessible healthcare to people," a Consumers Union attorney told NPR in 2010. "And now the mission is to make money for stockholders." The most substantial threat to OpenAI's plans though, might not be Musk or other critics. The California and Delaware attorneys general are both making inquiries into the specifics of the transition. "The current beneficiaries of OpenAI have an interest in ensuring that charitable assets are not transferred to private interests without due consideration," Delaware's attorney general, Kathleen Jennings, said. AGs have meaningful legal powers to get involved. In 2002, Pennsylvania's attorney general intervened in a planned deal by the nonprofit foundation that controls the for-profit Hershey chocolate brand to sell its assets to Wrigley for $12 billion, citing the potential harm to the town of Hershey. The sale was ultimately called off. Jump to

Title: Hedge funds are trimming their Magnificent 7 holdings — here's what they're buying instead

Hedge funds are making some adjustments to their tech-investing playbook. The Magnificent Seven stocks — which include Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — contributed over 50% to the S&P 500's gains last year, but the biggest money managers in the market are increasingly looking to different parts of the market, according to Goldman Sachs' analysis of 695 hedge funds with $3.1 trillion of gross equity positions at the start of the first quarter of 2025. Despite remaining top holdings in Q4 of 2024, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks saw a net decrease in hedge fund ownership except for Tesla. The Magnificent Seven stocks have struggled so far this year. The group's year-to-date return has lagged behind the overall S&P 500 index, with every stock in the Magnificent Seven down in 2025 while the index is up 2.5%. One explanation for the underperformance is that the market is still trying to appropriately quantify DeepSeek's impact. The Magnificent Seven is planning to continue its aggressive AI capex spend for a total of $280 billion in aggregate expenditures, up 34% year over year. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing if those dollars are resulting in tangible results, especially when DeepSeek uses a fraction of the cost. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers, with Meta the only one rising on earnings," Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy for Bank of America, wrote in a recent note. While the Magnificent Seven stocks are still hedge funds' largest holdings, the funds have increased their exposure to the healthcare and communication services sectors, upping their existing overweights by 135 and 118 basis points, respectively, last quarter, Goldman Sachs said. Healthcare stocks underperformed in 2024, gaining just 2%, but they've had a strong start to 2025, with the sector up 6% year to date. The sector is sensitive to government regulation, so it could be in for some volatility in 2025 if existing healthcare policies change, the bank said. Goldman Sachs identified UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as one of last quarter's "Rising Stars," or stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors. In communication services, Walt Disney Company (DIS) was another Rising Star. Hedge funds are still bullish on AI, but instead of only focusing on the Magnificent Seven, they're turning to "Phase 3," or companies with AI-enabled revenues. As the technology develops more use cases, the biggest winners will be the companies that use AI to boost productivity and grow revenue streams. Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) were the top AI Phase 3 stocks among hedge funds last quarter, according to Goldman Sachs. Hedge funds also adjusted holdings last quarter to take advantage of the Trump trade, meaning they moved to cut back on stocks exposed to China and tariffs. Instead, hedge funds added potential deregulation beneficiaries and companies exposed to small businesses and domestic sales. The natural gas processing business Williams Companies (WMB) appeared on the Rising Stars list. While investors are exercising increased caution around the Magnificent Seven and financials, that doesn't mean that hedge funds are jumping ship entirely on those trades: Tesla (TSLA) and Robinhood Markets (HOOD) made the Rising Stars list. Especially within financials, while hedge funds may have cut back on their overall sector allocations, certain individual stocks did well. Hedge funds also believe Stifel Financial Corp (SF) is shaping to be a potential deregulation beneficiary under Trump. Jump to

This development has prompted questions about the company’s long-term requirements for AI computing capacity. Notably, Microsoft recently reiterated its commitment to an $80 billion capital expenditure plan for the current fiscal year, ending in June, with a signficant portion of that investment directed towards the construction of data centers designed to support AI workloads. MSFT stock declined 1% in a week, and at its current levels of around $400, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition.

Title: Why Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad Is Going Private

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific When is privatization not really privatization? Passengers walk through the departure hall at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, May 4, 2018. Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) is the holding company that operates most of the airports in Malaysia, including the country’s main entry point, Kuala Lumpur International Airport. MAHB has an interesting backstory because in 1999 it was listed on the Malaysian stock exchange. It was the first major airport operator in Southeast Asia to become a publicly listed company. Although shares were traded on the exchange, until 2023 more than 54 percent of MAHB was owned by three state-owned investment funds: Kazanah Nasional, the Employee Provident Fund, and KWAP, a pension fund for public employees. This is a common ownership structure in the region, where companies operating strategic national infrastructure like airports will be partially privatized so they can raise capital on financial markets. However, a controlling stake will often be retained by state-owned investment funds or in some cases directly by the government. It’s a classic example of a state capitalist political economy, because the state wants to tap capital markets to raise money, but without entirely turning critical national infrastructure over to private market forces. If an airport is run purely according to commercial concerns, for instance, with the goal of maximizing profits for shareholders, then other concerns such as economic development or national security may be sidelined. By listing a company on the stock exchange but retaining majority ownership, the state can have the best of both worlds. MAHB has been operated in this way for the last 25 years. But all of that is changing now, as the airport operator was delisted from the stock exchange at the end of February after a consortium of investors initiated a takeover at 11 ringgit per share. This gives the company a valuation of around 18 billion ringgit, or $4 billion. With MAHB now officially delisted, it means Southeast Asia’s first airport operator to have an IPO has been returned to private ownership. Except, is this really privatization? It’s being referred to as a private takeover. But the consortium that has taken over MAHB is comprised of three parties. The first is Global Infrastructure Partners, an American company owned by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. The other two partners in the consortium are Khazanah Nasional, one of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth funds, and the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), the largest state-run investment fund in Malaysia. They were already major shareholders in MAHB, but with the acquisition, Khazanah increases its holdings to 40 percent and the EPF to 30 percent. So, while it is true that members of the public can no longer freely buy and sell shares in MAHB on the stock exchange, two of its new private owners, who between them control 70 percent of the shares, are state-run investment funds. Another interesting question is why MAHB went private like this in the first place. This is a question many people have been asking because there were some odd things about the deal. For one, MAHB is not a poor-performing company. Unlike Ninoy Aquino International Airport in the Philippines, which was turned over to the private sector because of poor financial and operational performance, MAHB has recovered from the pandemic, is profitable, and is even paying regular dividends. So this is not a case where a struggling company needed to be bailed out by the efficiency of the private sector. The sale has also provoked questions about the valuation and process. The EPF sold a significant amount of its stock in MAHB in 2023 when the price was between 6.8 and 7.7 ringgit per share. Now they are buying those shares back and more, at a higher price of 11 ringgit per share. Moreover, some of MAHB’s independent directors initially recommended shareholders reject the offer because they felt the price was too low. The new owners were granted several extensions by regulators giving them more time to get shareholder approval. Looked at in this way, to me this seems less like privatization and more like the government actually wants to regain greater control over its national airports. State-run investment funds have increased their direct ownership in MAHB, in the case of EPF doing so even when it meant buying back in at a higher price. This fits with a larger pattern we are seeing in Malaysia, where state-run investment funds are being leveraged to play a more active role in economic development. And although they’ve done it using the rhetoric of privatization, the lines between public interest and private ownership in this deal are actually somewhat blurred.

Title: ‘At least 7 in 10′ house buyers get gifts from parents, often six-figure sums

The bank of mum and dad is having a moment. Yes, it may have been around for years but, increasingly, wealthy boomers and Gen Xers are cited as playing an ever-more important role in determining the financial outlook of their children. This is creating a greater divide between those whose parents have and those who do not. This month, New York magazine examined how parents are “slowly transferring trillions of dollars to their New York city children”, while the Financial Times recently likened the situation to the old TV drama, Upstairs Downstairs about the upper classes and their servants in early 20th-century England. In this case, the “upstairs” people are those who can afford to own a home with more than one storey, and the “downstairs” people are stuck renting a flat. Just last week, UK building society Skipton Group published a survey showing that just one in 10 potential first-time buyers can afford to get on the property ladder without relying on their family for financial help. Here in Ireland, the gap between the upstairs and downstairs looks to be widening all the time. New estimates point to more than half a billion euro worth of gifts pouring into the Irish property market each year. All of which makes an already pricey property market even more expensive. “Parents’ gifts are making the difference ... no one can deny it’s a contributory factor to house price inflation,” says Michael Dowling, managing director of Dowling Financial mortgage brokers in Dublin. Just before we speak, Dowling says, he was working with a couple on a house application who are bringing a sizeable sum to the table – a gift of some €117,000. It’s not the typical gift – Dowling puts this at about €50,000-€60,000 – but it’s not that unusual either. “I would say that it [giving gifts] has become particularly noticeable over the past five years, it’s now quite significant,” he says, adding that in his experience in the Dublin market, “at least seven out of 10 [purchasers] are now getting gifts”. With stock in short supply, that creates an unequal playing field, as those with the benefit of family gifts chase the same property as those without those benefits. Martina Hennessy, chief executive of mortgage broker Doddl.ie, says that gifts are prevalent today, with a third of its clients receiving gifts when buying a home. Almost 85 per cent of those who got a gift were under the €100,000 threshold in her experience, with an average gift of €27,000. But that means 15 per cent received a gift that was in excess of €100,000 – and, among this cohort, the average gift was a staggering €198,000. Brian Dempsey, a partner in DNG Stillorgan, says a gift from the bank of mum and dad now “plays a pivotal part in buying a home in today’s market”. “Gifts used to be worth about €10,000-€15,000, but they are considerably more now, I’d say,” he says, adding that these gifts, and the added flexibility it offers house purchasers when making offers, can make or break a house purchase when you have multiple people bidding on it. Official statistics are difficult to come by. Back in 2021, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) collated figures (the last time it has done so) showing that first-time buyers got financial help from family of some €149 million in the first six months of that year, and those trading up got nearly €60.5 million. On an annual basis, this meant about €420 million in gifts a year. Fast forward some four years and industry experts say the scale of gifts must now be well in excess of half a billion. It’s clear that those who have are looking to give. “Gifts bridge the gap on affordability as many parents who have the means to do so provide gifts now as opposed to future inheritance,” says Hennessy. There is some €155 billion currently languishing on deposit in Ireland and falling rates of return on such deposits may encourage those who have the financial resources to gift now, when it can make a bigger impact on a child’s life, rather than waiting until death. After all, baby boomers and many in Generation X have themselves benefited from a sharp increase in house prices. Ultimately this inheritocracy is having a direct impact on rising inequality in terms of access to the housing market Back in 1982, for example, you could buy a five-bed detached house at Grove Lawn in Blackrock for £79,000: that house would now likely sell for more than €1 million. Of course inflation does account for some of this gain – £100,000 back in 1982 would be worth €301,785 today according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) – but there is still a significant gain made on that property. And many such homeowners also finished paying their mortgage quite some time ago. CSO figures show that some 680,000 homes in Ireland were owned without a mortgage in Census 2022. No surprise then that all this gifted money flowing into the property market is contributing to higher house prices. At a simple level, higher house prices mean higher deposits. Figures from the CSO show that, in the year to November 2024, house prices rose by 9.4 per cent nationally. This put the median price across the State at €350,000, and €470,000 in Dublin. Just two years earlier, in November 2022, the median national price was just €299,500. And thanks to gifts, home buyers don’t always have to stretch themselves when it comes to borrowing. Figures from the Central Bank show that home buyers now typically buy a home with a significantly higher down payment. The average loan to value on a first-time buyer loan in the first quarter of last year was less than 80 per cent, indicating a typical 20 per cent deposit. And it was even less for second-time buyers, at just 66 per cent, reflecting a typical down payment of some 34 per cent. With a median house price of about €655,000 in Dún Laoghaire, south Dublin, this would suggest a deposit of some €131,000 for a first-time buyer, or €222,000 for a trader upper. Saving that sort of money is hard when rents are at record highs; the average rent for a new tenancy nationally stood at €1,612 per month in the first quarter of last year, and €2,128 in Dublin. But the level of gifting means that some first-time buyers are now skipping the typical starter home stage and going straight for the if not quite forever home, then a home for the longer term. So they don’t borrow less; they just use the gift to buy a more expensive property. “It can be the difference between living in one part of Dublin compared to another,” adds Dowling, “or buying a three-bed rather than a two-bed, or one that’s in better condition and doesn’t need renovations”. The scale of gift-giving is now such that many parents can feel an obligation to help their children get on the property ladder – even if they can’t really afford it. “Absolutely, there is an expectation that they’re going to get a gift,” says Dowling. “When we meet couples, they now say ‘and we’ll be getting a gift’ as part of the process.” This can put parents under financial pressure at a time when they may need the funds themselves for their own retirement. “Gifts are now so prevalent and so large that people need to be careful,” says Dowling. Dempsey agrees that there is a pressure, which means that some parents can end up giving more than they had intended. “I bet you that gift amounts change,” he says, adding that some parents may commit to a gift of €20,000, but end up having to hand over €50,000 to get their children on the ladder. Another issue can arise when couples may not have any legal arrangement for buying a home. “When a couple isn’t married, there is often a reluctance from one set of parents to giving a gift,” says Dowling. After all, if the relationship breaks down, and the home is sold, it can be difficult to recoup the money given as a gift, as it’s likely it will depend on the party who didn’t receive the gift to “do the right thing” and give it back. “In an ideal world, they would both bring the same gift,” says Dowling, “but in reality it’s not the case”. Other times couples will come to Dowling and say: “We’ll sign the papers to say it’s a gift, but on the side, we have a loan agreement.” In some instances, Dowling says, this is because parents want to protect their interests – even if it doesn’t really stack up as such. Other times, people might be looking to get around the tax-free threshold on inheritance tax by passing the money off as a loan rather than a gift. However, it should be noted that Revenue has firm guidelines on such loans – and signing a legal document to say the money is a gift may preclude then being seen as a loan down the line. Better to try to use the small gift exemption – which could see the parents of a couple contribute tax-free savings of some €12,000 a year. Ultimately this inheritocracy is having a direct impact on rising inequality in terms of access to the housing market. Government supports, such as Help to Buy, which offers a tax rebate of as much as €30,000 on a new home purchase of up to €500,000, can help closing the affordability gap on a deposit. But with new house supply lower than expected, finding a home that meets the criteria isn’t always that easy; a quick search on myhome.ie for example, shows that there are just five new developments for sale at prices of lower than €500,000 in Dublin. This makes it more difficult for the have-nots to get on the housing ladder. “That social divide is going to continue,” says Dowling. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

In an otherwise empty restaurant, being expected to sit on top of the only other customers is always a pain, says our critic Neapolitan margherita verace pizza. Photo: Lucinda O'Sullivan What should have been a pleasant Sunday afternoon lunch at a new Italian pizza and pasta bar, instead turned out to be something of an endurance test. Un’ Altra Pasta Bar opened recently opposite Blackrock Library, in a premises with which I’m quite familiar having previously been Clarets in the 1990s, Dali’s in the 00s, and more recently the sadly missed Coal. The layout hasn’t changed much through the years. With a small bar to the right and a large newly-added pizza oven area to the left, there are three or four tight tables in front, and a prized alcove table to the side before you reach the main dining area in the rear.

Generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform India’s energy sector, driving significant improvements in efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness, according to the EY India report, ‘How much productivity can GenAI unlock in India? The AIdea of India: 2025’. It reveals that 66% of respondents have initiated Proof of Concepts (POCs) for GenAI, with 49% actively exploring AI with allocated budgets. However, only 17% are bullish and investing, while another 17% are in a wait-and-watch mode with small experiments. The survey also highlights that mature enterprises typically allocate 0.4% to 0.7% of their revenues to AI/ML initiatives, achieving an ROI of around 2% of annual revenues.

In the metals and mining sector, while AI applications have been widely implemented, GenAI has primarily been applied in non-core manufacturing functions to enhance productivity and speed of execution. According to the EY survey, 50% of respondents believe AI has been instrumental in reducing costs. 33% say AI has improved customer satisfaction, while 17% cite benefits for employee satisfaction. The real potential of GenAI lies in amplifying AI’s impact on core operations by leveraging extensive structured and unstructured data.

Hindalco (-3.43%), National Aluminium (-3.13%), Vedanta (-2.70%), JSL (-2.04%) IT Services: 21 IT companies at CG2025: Navigating a slow recovery by Kotak Institutional Equities. CG2025 takeaways: A slow recovery We hosted 21 Indian technology companies for our flagship Chasing Growth 2025 conference. The key takeaways from the conversations with companies are (1) cost optimization continues to be the primary demand driver, (2) the outlook on discretionary spending recovery is mixed, (3) AI will generate significant productivity benefits in services and provide new opportunities and (4) GCC expansion is temporary and a later-stage opportunity. The slower spending recovery and near-term risk from AI adoption lead to downside risks to our revenue growth and margin estimates and stock multiples. We like Infosys and TechM among Tier 1; Coforge, Indegene and LTIM in mid-tier. The weak business momentum leads us to maintain a cautious view on ERD companies despite the ~18-36% decline in stock prices in the past year.

Generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform India’s energy sector, driving significant improvements in efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness, according to the EY India report, ‘How much productivity can GenAI unlock in India? The AIdea of India: 2025’. It reveals that 66% of respondents have initiated Proof of Concepts (POCs) for GenAI, with 49% actively exploring AI with allocated budgets. However, only 17% are bullish and investing, while another 17% are in a wait-and-watch mode with small experiments. The survey also highlights that mature enterprises typically allocate 0.4% to 0.7% of their revenues to AI/ML initiatives, achieving an ROI of around 2% of annual revenues. With both ‘Driver’ and ‘Driven’ models of AI adoption emerging, energy companies are leveraging GenAI for predictive maintenance, real-time grid optimization, and personalized customer engagement. In the metals and mining sector, while AI applications have been widely implemented, GenAI has primarily been applied in non-core manufacturing functions to enhance productivity and speed of execution. According to the EY survey, 50% of respondents believe AI has been instrumental in reducing costs. 33% say AI has improved customer satisfaction, while 17% cite benefits for employee satisfaction. The real potential of GenAI lies in amplifying AI’s impact on core operations by leveraging extensive structured and unstructured data.

As for ENERGIE SWAP, also a 3-wheeled vehicle, it meets the needs of freight and offers a reliable certified range of 74 km per exchange.

Hindalco (-3.43%), National Aluminium (-3.13%), Vedanta (-2.70%), JSL (-2.04%) IT Services: 21 IT companies at CG2025: Navigating a slow recovery by Kotak Institutional Equities. CG2025 takeaways: A slow recovery We hosted 21 Indian technology companies for our flagship Chasing Growth 2025 conference. The key takeaways from the conversations with companies are (1) cost optimization continues to be the primary demand driver, (2) the outlook on discretionary spending recovery is mixed, (3) AI will generate significant productivity benefits in services and provide new opportunities and (4) GCC expansion is temporary and a later-stage opportunity. The slower spending recovery and near-term risk from AI adoption lead to downside risks to our revenue growth and margin estimates and stock multiples. We like Infosys and TechM among Tier 1; Coforge, Indegene and LTIM in mid-tier. The weak business momentum leads us to maintain a cautious view on ERD companies despite the ~18-36% decline in stock prices in the past year.

During a closed-door meeting with the SEC’s new crypto task force on Friday, representatives of several digital assets-involved firms—including Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and the financial services giant Fidelity—pressed the regulator to overhaul its ETF policies, according to publicly filed meeting notes. The companies, all members of the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry lobbying group, have asked the SEC to expand its current ETF-related standards. At the moment, only crypto assets traded in markets regulated by the SEC or CFTC—such as Bitcoin and Ethereum—are eligible to be traded on Wall Street via ETFs. But should the powerful firms that met with the SEC last week get their wish, that could soon change. Those companies have now asked the agency to expand the concept of a regulated market to include a “range of existing crypto trading platforms.” That minor shift in language could have seismic implications. Effectively, crypto and Wall Street’s top players are now asking for any crypto asset traded on, say, Coinbase, to be automatically fast-tracked for ETF approval. That’s a much, much lower bar than the one currently governing the ETF market. If Coinbase and Fidelity get their way, then you could soon see not only spot Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs proliferating on Wall Street—as we've seen pile up in recent months—but Peanut the Squirrel and Gigachad-related products, too. The memo submitted Friday on the subject acknowledged that such a change could usher in “a new wave” of crypto ETFs for retail traders. It would also, effectively, integrate the volatile meme coin sector with the traditional American economy. On Friday, the Crypto Council for Innovation further requested that the SEC allow ETF issuers to directly purchase and sell crypto, participate in staking digital assets, and earn staking rewards. Currently, crypto ETF issuers like Fidelity and BlackRock do not custody the BTC and ETH tied to their products, nor do they generate valuable yield from staking that ETH. A day prior to the Crypto Council for Innovation’s meeting with the SEC, Fidelity also met one-on-one with the agency’s crypto task force. During that conversation, the two parties reportedly discussed standardizing rules for listing crypto ETFs, and clarity surrounding the ability for ETF issuers to collect staking rewards. At Friday’s larger meeting, the companies present made several additional requests, including that the SEC should declare crypto products like stablecoins and NFTs to not be securities, and crypto offerings like airdrops to be outside the agency’s purview.

Title: Germany’s Newly-Elected Conservative Party Would Rather Side With Socialists Than Other Right-Wingers
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/24/germany-election-christian-democratic-union-socialist-coalition-alternative-for-germany-afd/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T23:13:30Z
Full Content:
After Germany’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) won a plurality of seats in federal elections Sunday, party leader Friedrich Merz said he will pursue a governing coalition with the country’s socialist party rather than its right-wing populist party. CDU achieved a comfortable 208 plurality in the Bundestag elections, short of the 316-seat absolute majority necessary to secure Merz’s chancellorship — meaning the party must form a coalition with another party before Merz can govern. At a celebration at the party’s headquarters Monday, the CDU leader confirmed he will pursue that coalition with the leftist Social Democratic Party (SPD), which came in third place at 120 seats — and not with the AfD, which came in second at an unprecedented 152 seats, more than doubling its presence since Germany’s 2021 election. (RELATED: EU Regulators Attacking X Because Of Elon Musk’s Political Positions) “We have received a clear governing mandate, and we accept it,” Merz, speaking German, said. “Looking at the Bundestag seat distribution, we are in a position to form a black-red coalition — and that is precisely what we intend to do.” This black-red coalition, better known as the “grand coalition,” is common in German parliamentary politics, with Angela Merkel notably ruling the country with this model when she was chancellor. Pressekonferenz im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus https://t.co/5QDpJGhZQh — Friedrich Merz (@_FriedrichMerz) February 24, 2025 Emphasizing the urgency of forming the coalition, Merz said he plans to meet with SPD leaders, including outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, to negotiate the coalition in the coming days. He added he is hopeful to form the government by Easter. The emerging CDU-SPD alliance, and its exclusion of the AfD, was expected — virtually the entire German political establishment has maligned the AfD as a dangerously radical organization since its founding in 2013, with the German state even classifying the party as a “suspected case of right-wing extremism” in 2022. The government uses this designation to justify its ongoing surveillance of party members and their private correspondences, a practice German federal courts have repeatedly confirmed as constitutional. Merz is a proponent of the “firewall against the far right” strategy in German politics, a practice among mainstream parties that views any cooperation with the AfD as a grave moral failing. He has routinely characterized the party as a successor to the Nazis, calling the AfD “openly National Socialist” in a 2018 interview with WDR 5, a German public radio station. “The regional associations, especially in the east, are receiving a crystal clear message from us: If any of us raise our hand to work with the AfD, then there will be a party expulsion process the next day,” he said in a statement shortly before becoming CDU leader in 2022. He reiterated this position in a January interview with Tagesthemen, a German television station, saying he “ties [his] destiny as party chairman” to preventing cooperation with the AfD. AfD leaders reject comparisons to the Nazi Party, with former party leader Alexander Gauland calling the Nazi era a “speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history” during a 2018 speech — a stance meant to reject what they see as excessive historical guilt. Though it initially focused on Euroskepticism, the AfD has since shifted to emphasize a mix of populist and nationalist positions, primarily opposition to immigration from Muslim-majority countries, which it frames as an existential threat to German culture and security. It calls for stricter border controls, immediate deportation of rejected asylum seekers and, most controversially, a policy of “remigration” — a term the European right uses to advocate for the mass deportation of immigrants and even some naturalized citizens deemed insufficiently assimilated. The AfD’s friendlier disposition towards Russia, its opposition to military aid for Ukraine and its calls to revive the Nord Stream II pipeline are also major points of contention for more established German parties. “We must now carry out large-scale repatriations, and if it is to be called ‘remigration,’ then so be it,” AfD leader Alice Weidel said at a campaign event in January. The AfD’s stances on immigration first gained traction after the 2015 refugee crisis, when Germany accepted over a million migrants under Merkel’s leadership. The foreign-born population has been on a consistent upward trajectory since that year, nearly doubling over this period to a record-high of 19.6% — over 16.5 million — according to German census data. Merz campaigned on a pro-NATO, pro-European Union (EU) platform, primarily advocating German independence from the United States by easing taboos against nuclear power, which he says increases Germany’s reliance on Russian and American energy — breaking from the Green Party, which largely closed Germany’s nuclear plants. He also aims to increase defense spending amid strained relations with President Donald Trump, who many see as offering Russia favorable terms in Ukraine peace talks. (RELATED: Germany Will Shut Down Its Last Nuclear Plants Amid Warnings Of New Energy Crisis) “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said in a post-election debate Sunday. “I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program — but after Donald Trump’s statements last week at the latest, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” The chancellor-in-waiting increased anti-immigration rhetoric after recent migrant-perpetrated violent attacks — including a January knife assault in Aschaffenburg that killed a toddler and a man — amid political pressure from the AfD, though Merz stopped short of endorsing remigration. Crime statistics show over 40% of crime suspects in Germany were foreign-born in 2023, according to Tagesthemen. U.S.-German relations have deteriorated since President Trump took office, particularly after his allies’ incursions into German politics. Vice President JD Vance criticized Germany’s online speech policing as “Orwellian” during a Munich Security Conference speech on Feb. 14. German leaders have also condemned Elon Musk’s endorsement of the AfD, which he called “the only hope for Germany.” 🇩🇪 AfD is the only hope for Germany 🇩🇪 https://t.co/CE9uXe8ULm — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 13, 2025 Merz’s political career began after his election to the European Parliament in 1989, later transitioning to serve as a representative in the Bundestag, Germany’s lower chamber of parliament in 1994, where he served until being named CDU leader in 2021. He previously chaired the German branch of BlackRock, an American asset management firm accused of contributing to rising single-family home prices in the United States. Merz, who owns two private jets, described himself as “upper middle class” in a 2018 interview with Bild, a German tabloid. He added in his victory speech Monday that Merkel, the previous CDU chancellor and Merz’s longtime political rival, had yet to congratulate him on his electoral plurality. There remains no indication that Merz — or any major party leader in Germany — will loosen his “firewall” policy against the AfD, despite its surge in support Sunday.

Microsoft terminated select leases with at least two private data center operators across multiple U.S. markets, accounting for “a couple of hundred megawatts” of power, according to a copy of TD Cowen's report as cited by Bloomberg. For a perspective of how much power that is, 1 megawatt can power 250 homes during peak usage hours, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. “While we have yet to get the level of color via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position,” TD Cowen reportedly wrote. Artificial intelligence depends heavily on massive amounts of data, requiring increased computing power, greater storage, and faster network speeds—all of which data centers provide. However, newer open-source AI models like DeepSeek claim to operate at a fraction of the cost of their American rivals. AI developers may be reassessing where they put their money. An industry source familiar with the matter told Decrypt Microsoft’s pullback reflects a shift in OpenAI workloads toward competitors like Oracle. Oracle, Google, and Meta have all seen significant year-over-year growth in demand, while Amazon’s demand has remained steady. There are currently 3,317 data centers in the U.S. alone, according to figures from tracking website Data Center Map. Addressing questions about shifts in its data center approach, Microsoft reaffirmed its dedication to ongoing growth and infrastructure investments to satisfy rising customer demand. “While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Decrypt. "This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.” Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion on “infrastructure” in 2025, the spokesperson said. “Microsoft is adjusting its data center usage targets over the coming years due to increased competition from other players launching new projects,” Blockspace Media co-founder Will Foxley told Decrypt. “Microsoft is still aggressively flexing its budget for data center growth, so I don't take the TD Cowen note as too noteworthy long term.” Foxley, the former Director of Media and Strategy at Compass Mining, noted that such cancellations or adjustments are common for large enterprises. "A company like Microsoft is likely negotiating globally for dozens of data centers simultaneously," he explained. “A few cancellations aren't especially surprising." In contrast, Foxley pointed out that the stakes for canceling data center leases could be significantly higher for Bitcoin miners. “Miners have less capital and operate under tighter timelines,” Foxley said. “That means cancellations can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Hit with Investor Lawsuit Over CagriSema Obesity Drug – Hagens Berman

February 24, 2025 17:18 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit filed by investors who claim they were misled about the future of its experimental obesity treatment, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey under the title Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, alleges that the company and its key executives committed securities violations during the Phase 3 trial of CagriSema, known as REDEFINE-1. Investors who acquired Novo Nordisk securities between November 2, 2022, and December 19, 2024, allege that the firm painted an overly optimistic picture of CagriSema’s potential for achieving significant weight loss of at least 25%. According to the plaintiffs, Novo Nordisk relied on questionable data while glossing over issues with dosage tolerability. Central to the lawsuit is the claim that the company’s “optimistic forecasts” about CagriSema’s effectiveness were unfounded. The suit also contends that the study’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, compromised the trial's ability to assess weight loss at the tested dosage accurately. This, the plaintiffs suggest, implies either unexpected tolerability issues that led patients to reduce their doses or a rushed patient selection process that included those not targeting the 25% weight loss goal. The complaint points to Novo Nordisk’s December 20, 2024, announcement of REDEFINE-1's preliminary results. The disclosure indicated that the trial used a flexible dosing protocol and revealed that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of CagriSema patients were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the comparator drugs. Following the announcement, Novo Nordisk's stock price plunged nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue that this drop highlights the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Hagens Berman is investigating investors’ claims. “We are thoroughly investigating these allegations to determine whether Novo Nordisk intentionally misrepresented trial details and masked significant issues with the drug's tolerability,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: 5 Stocks To Buy Now For March 2025

Time Published: 2025-02-24T21:35:02Z

These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of ... [+] growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. In today's market environment, finding the right stocks requires careful analysis of company fundamentals and broader economic trends. With inflation showing signs of cooling and the Federal Reserve hinting at potential rate cuts later this year, certain sectors are particularly well-positioned for growth. This article examines five compelling stock picks that offer strong potential for capital appreciation and steady returns. These selections come from diverse sectors, including technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary, providing investors with opportunities for portfolio diversification. Each company demonstrates solid fundamentals, strong market positioning, and compelling growth catalysts, making them attractive investment options for March 2025 and beyond. This selection process focused on companies with strong fundamentals, sustainable competitive advantages and clear growth catalysts. I evaluated each stock using a comprehensive framework that considered financial metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on equity, as well as qualitative factors, including market position, management quality and industry trends. Special attention was paid to companies with proven track records of navigating economic uncertainties while maintaining strong balance sheets. Additionally, I considered current market conditions and sector-specific trends that could impact performance over the next 12-24 months. Each company was assessed for its valuation relative to peers and historical averages, ensuring that our picks offer reasonable entry points for investors despite the market's recent gains. Microsoft continues to dominate the enterprise software market while making significant strides in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's Azure cloud platform has become a cornerstone of its business, consistently gaining market share against competitors. Microsoft's strategic acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its partnership with OpenAI has further strengthened its position in gaming and AI technologies, creating multiple growth vectors for the future. Microsoft's compelling investment case rests on its exceptional market position across multiple high-growth segments and its proven ability to monetize new technologies. The company's AI integration across its product suite, particularly in Microsoft 365 and Azure, has created significant competitive advantages and new revenue streams. With enterprise IT spending expected to remain robust and the continued shift toward cloud computing, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory. Furthermore, with nearly one billion dollars in cash and liquid assets (MSFT 10K), Microsoft's strong balance sheet provides ample resources for continued innovation and strategic acquisitions. The company's consistent dividend growth and share buyback program offer additional value to shareholders, making it an attractive option for growth and income investors. UnitedHealth Group is the largest healthcare company by revenue globally, operating through two platforms: UnitedHealthcare (health insurance) and Optum (healthcare services). The company's integrated approach to healthcare delivery and technology-driven solutions has created a powerful competitive moat. Its Optum division continues to drive innovation in healthcare delivery while expanding margins. UnitedHealth's combination of scale, technological innovation and vertical integration makes it uniquely positioned to benefit from healthcare sector growth. The company's investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics are improving operational efficiency and patient outcomes while reducing costs. The aging U.S. population and increasing healthcare spending provide strong secular tailwinds for continued growth. The drop in price after its CEO was assassinated brought the company down to a more attractive level. The company's consistent execution and strong financial performance, evidenced by nearly double-digit consecutive quarters of earnings beats, demonstrate management's ability to navigate complex healthcare regulations while maintaining profitability. UnitedHealth's dividend growth history and reasonable payout ratio suggest room for continued dividend increases. This stock looks even more attractive after its 12% drop on February 21, following the U.S. Department of Justice's announcement of a civil fraud probe into the company’s Medicare billing. I believe this lawsuit does not significantly threaten the company’s long-term prospects. The market may be reacting out of fear, especially with the upcoming trial of Luigi Mangione, the suspected murderer of UNH’s CEO, which could be casting a negative spotlight on the company. I suggest waiting for a slightly more significant pullback and buying at $435 per share. Mastercard's global payment network continues benefiting from the shift toward digital payments and e-commerce. The company's technology processes billions of transactions annually across more than 210 countries and territories. Beyond its core payment processing business, Mastercard has successfully expanded into value-added services, including cybersecurity, data analytics, and consulting, creating additional revenue streams and strengthening its relationships with financial institutions. Mastercard's investment appeal lies in its powerful network effects, high margins and exposure to global digital payment trends. The company's asset-light business model generates significant free cash flow, allowing for continued investment in technology and strategic acquisitions. Its expansion into emerging markets and new payment technologies, including blockchain and real-time payments, positions it well for future growth. Recent partnerships with fintech companies and investments in open banking capabilities demonstrate Mastercard's commitment to innovation and market expansion. With global digital payment volumes expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% through 2027, Mastercard is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth. Eli Lilly has emerged as a leader in innovative therapeutics, particularly in diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease treatments. The company's GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, creating a massive market opportunity. Additionally, its Alzheimer's drug donanemab has shown promising results in clinical trials. Eli Lilly's strong position in the rapidly growing weight loss drug market represents a significant growth driver. Market estimates suggest the obesity market could reach $100 billion by 2030, with Eli Lilly positioned to capture a substantial share. The company's robust pipeline, including potential breakthrough treatments for Alzheimer's and cancer, provides multiple pathways for future growth. The company's consistent investment in R&D, strong patent protection for key drugs, and proven ability to bring innovative treatments to market make it an attractive long-term investment. With healthcare spending expected to grow globally, Eli Lilly's focus on chronic diseases and unmet medical needs positions it well for sustained growth. Costco's membership-based warehouse club model demonstrates remarkable resilience and growth potential. The company's focus on providing high-quality products at competitive prices has created strong customer loyalty, evidenced by its industry-leading membership renewal rates of over 90%. Costco's expansion into e-commerce and international markets provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining its core value proposition. Costco's competitive advantages stem from its efficient operations, strong purchasing power, and loyal customer base. The company's membership model provides predictable recurring revenue, while its reputation for quality and value helps it maintain market share even during economic downturns. Recent investments in digital capabilities and supply chain optimization have improved operational efficiency and customer experience. The company's international expansion plans, particularly in China and other Asian markets, offer significant growth potential. With 29 new warehouse openings planned for fiscal 2025 and continued growth in e-commerce sales, Costco is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory while returning value to shareholders through regular dividends and special dividend payments. Bottom Line These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. While Microsoft and Mastercard provide exposure to digital transformation and financial technology trends, UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly offer stakes in healthcare innovation and demographic trends. Costco rounds out the selection with its defensive characteristics and steady growth potential. When making investment decisions, investors should always consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and portfolio diversification.

Title: House Hunters Episode Derailed After BlackRock Buys All 3 Properties

ORANGE, CA — A new episode of HGTV's House Hunters was derailed yesterday after BlackRock quickly purchased all three of the potential properties. In a first for the fan-favorite show, the prospective homebuyers were left without any options at the end of the episode, as the global investment firm swept in to snap up all three houses to add to its growing U.S. real estate portfolio. "Oh no!" said the host to the prospective homebuyers. "It looks like these homes are no longer available. In fact, it seems there are now no longer any homes available in this neighborhood and you can no longer afford to live here. Too bad!" "It's probably something we're going to have to deal with from now on," said House Hunters producer Jennifer Davis. "We were getting ready to present our featured couple with their three options, but at the last moment, we were notified that BlackRock had purchased all three properties and would never allow them to hit the market again. The buyers were disappointed, but there's nothing anyone can do about it." The episode's featured homebuyers, Gavin and Emily Harmon, were taken by surprise when they were told they were left with no options. "We definitely had the impression we were going to, you know, get a house," Emily said. "With the title of the show being House Hunters and all, it was surprising to find out that all of the houses we looked at were absorbed by a shadowy corporation intent on dominating the global real estate market and destroying the dream of home ownership. Oh well. I guess we'll keep looking tomorrow." At publishing time, HGTV announced that the show would be rebranded as House Renters starting next season. Purchasing congresspeople has never been easier for lobbyists!

Title: Nvidia investors' call gives the chip giant a chance to tell backers why they're wrong about DeepSeek's impact
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/deepseek-impact-nvidia-investors-call-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T20:55:44Z
Full Content:
When Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, the chip giant will have the chance to tell investors why it thinks their intense reaction to the rise of DeepSeek was a mistake — or change the subject entirely. Heading into 2025, Nvidia's rule looked unassailable as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and others lined up for its chips. Then the Chinese startup DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model with benchmark results to rival OpenAI's o1 model. Critically, R1 was said to be produced with fewer and less powerful chips than o1. "DeepSeek's remarkable feat has shaken the industry's assumptions about how much capital or GPU chips a company needs to stay ahead of the competition," Barclays analysts wrote last month. Though Nvidia has largely recovered from markets' reaction to DeepSeek — the chip firm lost $600 billion in market capitalization in one day, in the biggest single drop in US market history — CEO Jensen Huang will need to show investors that the party is nowhere near over and that the promise of AI isn't overhyped. Huang previewed his argument at a virtual event broadcast Thursday, where he said investors had misinterpreted the signals of DeepSeek. As Nvidia prepares to address investors officially for the first time since the DeepSeek saga, here's what to look out for in its earnings. Analysts predict that Nvidia's revenue, especially in its all-important data center business, will keep rising — bolstered by coming data center buildouts. Nvidia's customers are still lining up. OpenAI's Stargate project is expected to spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US. Meta has forecast an additional $65 billion in spending on data centers this year. And Amazon recently forecast spending $100 billion on computing power. It will offer Nvidia fresh evidence to present to investors concerned that DeepSeek's claim to use chips more efficiently — a key driver in lowering costs — would hurt demand. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed 'revolutionary' optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," the Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to investors in early February. Model improvements are another favorable piece of evidence for Nvidia. Grok 3, xAI's latest model, has received praise for its performance. Musk's firms also recently collaborated on a second data center with roughly 12,000 Nvidia GPUs, Business Insider exclusively reported. Musk has been aggressively adding to the fleet of GPU-packed data centers supporting Grok, suggesting a link between progress and infrastructure. Morgan Stanley analysts told investors in a note last week that model builders and hyperscalers still had their eyes on artificial general intelligence and that cheaper, highly functional models like DeepSeek wouldn't affect that pursuit. Nvidia's latest and most powerful chip series, Blackwell, has struggled with a slow rollout due to manufacturing and overheating issues. Analysts, however, are expecting the company to report a strong ramp-up. "Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will outstrip supply for several quarters," Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, said in an investor note last week. UBS's Timothy Arcuri wrote that after much consternation, investor fears of a botched rollout were relaxing, and strong sales numbers could put them fully at ease. UBS analysts also said the fourth quarter was the last in which Blackwell chips wouldn't make up the majority of Nvidia's GPU sales. Investors are likely to favor that shift because Blackwell brings with it higher profit margins. Nvidia's buzzy GTC conference is set to take place in San Jose, California, next month, marking the first anniversary of Blackwell's debut. Further growth in inference demand would also be a point for Huang's theory of investor error surrounding the DeepSeek rout. Demand for inference, the process of using and improving models once they've been trained, increases when consumers and businesses find value in AI tools. Investors will likely want to see the share of AI workloads continue to shift to inference, which also requires GPUs to run. On the company's latest call, in November, Huang repeatedly said inference across Nvidia's platforms was growing. Growth in the software layers of Nvidia's tech stack would be a good sign, too. This would suggest maturity in AI products and lend strength to a part of its business that's potentially even more difficult to compete with than the chips themselves. "What Nvidia talks about on its long-term moats and its possible deployment on the AI application side probably matters more this time," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Investors will also be looking for any signals from Nvidia about the company's approach to China as President Donald Trump threatens to upend business relations with the country. Just before the end of his term, President Joe Biden initiated new regulations, now in a 120-day comment period, on the export of high-powered chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Many policy analysts expect Trump to allow the rules to take effect, as they align with his "America First" agenda, though Trump hasn't directly addressed them. Trump last month described AI leadership as critical to ensuring "economic and national security." Last month, Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwan, the home of Nvidia's chip manufacturing partner, TSMC. Tariffs could lead to increased costs for Nvidia. Huang met with the president at the White House last month, but neither party provided details of the discussion. Though Nvidia's share price has recovered much of its DeepSeek-induced losses, the $3 trillion juggernaut faces various headwinds. Huang's job on Wednesday will be to reassure investors that those headwinds will be mild and reaffirm that Nvidia remains fundamental to the AI story. Jump to

Title: Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk Disliked by Most Americans, Survey Shows

Republicans and Democrats are split on how they view Musk, while Americans of all political stripes have an unfavorable view of Meta’s boss Most Americans are not big fans of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, the world’s two richest men, according to new survey data from Pew Research Center. The majority of respondents (54%) said they had an unfavorable view of Musk, including 36% saying they had a “very” unfavorable opinion of him. Musk — who owns X and is the boss of Tesla and SpaceX, among other companies — received a “favorable” vote from 42% of respondents. It is worth noting that Musk’s favorability differs wildly across party lines. Among respondents who said they leaned towards Democrats and left-leaning candidates, 85% of them said they disliked Musk; 73% of Republicans, on the other hand, had a favorable view of him. That does not come as much of a shock, considering Musk spent at least $250 million to help President Trump and other Republicans win elections last November. And Musk has been a key cog in Trump’s second administration, where he is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE; Musk said last week he is aiming to trim at least $1 trillion in annual spending from the federal bureaucracy. The Meta CEO, meanwhile, is even more disliked than Musk, with 67% of Americans saying they have an unfavorable view of Zuckerberg. That distaste is shared among Democrats and Republicans, with 76% of left-leaning respondents saying they have an unfavorable view of Zuckerberg, and 60% of right-leaning respondents saying the same thing. Zuckerberg has had a notoriously up-and-down relationship with President Trump, whom he banned from Instagram and Facebook in early 2021, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. At the time, Zuckerberg said “the risks” of keeping him on the platforms were “simply too great.” Trump was later reinstated to those platforms in 2023. More recently, Zuckerberg has had a better rapport with the president. He donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and he was there in Washington, D.C. last month, alongside Musk and other tech executives like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google chief Sundar Pichai. Despite that, most Trump fans in D.C. told TheWrap they remained skeptical of Zuckerberg’s sudden embrace of President Trump. Zuckerberg, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Tracker, has a net worth of $241 billion, making him the second richest person in the world. His net worth has received a nice boost recently, thanks to Meta’s stock price jumping 20% since early November. Musk, despite a recent decline for Tesla’s stock price, remains the world’s richest person with a net worth of $385 billion. Pew’s survey was conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2 and included 5,086 respondents.

Title: Alibaba Places $52 Billion Price Tag on AI Plans
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/alibaba-places-52-billion-price-tag-on-ai-plans/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T19:50:22Z
Full Content:
Last week, Chinese tech conglomerate Alibaba announced a major uptick in AI spending. Now, the company has put a price tag on the effort, according to a Monday (Feb. 24) report by Reuters: at least 380 billion yuan, or $52.44 billion, over a three-year period. During an earnings call last week, the company said it would spend more on artificial intelligence (AI) in the next three years than it has in the last 10, without providing an exact figure. The goal, management said, is to help Alibaba pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI), or a version of AI that can think and reason at or above the level of humans. “We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence. Why is that the primary aim?” Eddie Wu, the company’s CEO, said during the earnings call. “Well, it’s because all of the visible AI application scenarios today that we see around content creation, search and so on and so forth have arisen precisely as a result of the ongoing extension of those boundaries, and we want to keep pushing out those boundaries to create more and more opportunities.” As PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, developing AGI has become a goal for most of the world’s biggest tech players such as OpenAI, Google and Meta. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “fanned the flames” — as that report put it — at the beginning of the year when he wrote on his blog that the company is “now confident we know how to build AGI” as the technology has been traditionally recognized. “Achieving AGI would have big implications for business. For example, one AI system can analyze market trends while simultaneously redesigning the supply chain to adapt to those changes,” PYMNTS wrote. “It can handle customer service while using those interactions to inform product development. It can manage operations while developing innovative solutions to efficiency problems. It can make strategic decisions by synthesizing information across multiple industries and domains, which requires high-level general reasoning.” The Reuters report notes that Alibaba has begun 2025 as “a winner in China’s AI race,” attracting investors with its business deals, and seeing its stock climb more than 68% this year. Perhaps the company’s most high-profile deal is the one it recently inked with Apple, to help that company develop an AI-powered iPhone for sale in China. Restrictions by the Chinese government require companies to have a local partner before launching AI products. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: What is Jeff Bezos' net worth?

Time Published: 2025-02-24T19:31:09Z

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week The Amazon tycoon and third richest person in the world made his fortune pioneering online retail Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is one of the most recognizable members of an uber-wealthy global elite. As the owner of the Washington Post since 2013, he is also a frequent target of critics on both sides of the American political divide. Like many of the world's most fabulously wealthy, Bezos' path to riches was greased with family wealth — but it was Bezos' vision that turned an online hub for used books in the early internet era into a world-best market hegemony powerful enough to muscle out competition in virtually any field over the course of 30 years. In large part because Amazon delivery trucks are a ubiquitous presence on America's streets, Bezos has since accumulated enough wealth to be richer than many of the world's countries. Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. After college, Bezos went to work for a financial technology startup, Fitel, before moving to banking and then to the hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990, where he was "tasked with researching potential business opportunities involving the then brand-new internet landscape," said CNBC. There, he would show "many of the idiosyncratic qualities his employees would later observe at Amazon," including "constantly recording ideas in a notebook he carried with him," said Brad Stone in an excerpt from his 2013 book "The Everything Store."

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. Bezos and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left the hedge fund to start the organization that would become Amazon in 1994, initially operating it out of a Seattle garage. Originally called "Cadabra," the name "later changed because it sounded too much like "cadaver," or a dead human body used for research," said Yahoo. Amazon.com was launched in 1995 as an online bookseller and a year later it was considered one of the "well-established internet shops" pressuring brick-and-mortar retailers like Barnes and Noble as well as smaller, independent bookstores, said The New York Times in 1996. Amazon "survived early prophecies of doom" and eventually "branched out into selling music, movies, electronics and toys during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s." The company struggled through, but ultimately survived, the e-commerce crash of the early 2000s. Bezos took the firm public in 1997, and due to a rapid increase in the company's value, he "appeared on Forbes list of America's 400 wealthiest people for the first time in 1998," said Yahoo Finance, with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion at the time. He would never again fall out of the exclusive billionaire club. Yet Amazon itself would not develop into the market-dominating behemoth it is today until much later. As late as 2004, it was "still mostly selling just books and DVDs," even as it was "under siege from multiple sides" including retailers like Best Buy, said Vox. That is when Bezos' firm launched the company's Prime subscription service, a "$79-a-year loyalty program that includes free two-day shipping on any order," said CNN. The yearly subscription fee kept shoppers in the Amazon universe, and eventually made making purchases on the site so easy as to be near-seamless. Today, "75% of Americans now use Amazon Prime, a record level of penetration," said Business Insider. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and the billionaire space race What is Donald Trump's net worth? Is the US becoming an oligarchy? Over the years, Amazon continued to add innovative new products that disrupted existing industries, including the Kindle, a digital reader that "dominated every corner of the ebook industry" and today "might as well be synonymous with ebook, with its massive reach that accounts for 68% of overall" market for electronic book sales, said Book Riot. But it is Amazon's dominance of the global package shipping market, driven by Prime subscribers, that has made Bezos one of the richest people in history. Bezos "built the sprawling logistics and delivery empire" necessary "for many of us to buy almost anything we want with a click," said Vox. The company's labor practices and market dominance have been the target of regulatory investigations. Conditions in the company's warehouses have also drawn "scrutiny from government officials, labor groups and workers over high injury rates for the past several years," said The Guardian. Perhaps not coincidentally, in 2024 Amazon argued in a legal filing "that the "National Labor Relations Board was unconstitutional," said The New York Times. Amazon's global network of warehouses, fulfillment centers and delivery services "is the envy of, and inspiration for, Amazon's business partners and competitors," said Vox. Amazon is also one of the largest private employers in the country and in February 2025 "dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever," said CNBC. Amazon's market cap is an astonishing $2.36 trillion, according to Forbes. As his Amazon empire grew larger and larger, Bezos became involved with a variety of other ventures. In 2005, he created Bezos Expeditions, a venture capital and investment fund "through which he owns stakes in many companies including space-transportation startup Blue Origin," said The Wall Street Journal. In 2013, he bought the Washington Post for $250 million in cash, a maneuver which "stunned the media industry and sent shockwaves around Washington D.C.," said Politico. Bezos promised staff "that his ownership would bring no radical change to the paper's core values." In 2017, after Donald Trump's first presidential victory, Bezos added "Democracy Dies in Darkness," a "dramatic and alliterative phrase," beneath the paper's digital masthead, said the Post. The paper "lost $77 million" in 2023 and has "seen a dramatic 50% drop in audience since the highs of 2020," said CNN. In 2024, Bezos pulled the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering an exodus of tens of thousands of subscribers as well as a number of staff. Bezos' net worth took a hit from one of the world's most expensive divorces. In 2019, he and MacKenzie Scott announced that they were splitting. As part of the settlement, "Bezos handed Scott a 4% stake in Amazon, transferring a total of $38 billion in shares into her name," said the Independent. Bezos was, at the time, the world's richest man, and even shaving $38 billion off of his fortune left him with $119 billion. It would not be long before the external shock of a global pandemic helped his fortune recover. The Covid-19 pandemic "disproportionately padded the wealth of the richest," including Bezos, said The Guardian. As the demand for delivery services skyrocketed during the acute phase of the pandemic, Amazon's value soared, as did Bezos' net worth. Amazon's stock price went from just under $91 a share on February 28, 2020 to more than $173 a share in mid-October of 2020. Bezos' net worth jumped to more than $200 billion in 2021 but marginally declined to $196 billion by March 2024, said Yahoo Finance. That still made him the second-richest person in the world. Forbes, on the other hand, pegs his net worth at $233.1 billion as of February 21, 2025, which ranks him third on the list of the world's wealthiest people, with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg taking second place.

By Lambert Strether. Bird Song of the Day American Robin, Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge; Deadman Lake. Alaska, United States. Readers, I’m going to close out with the American Robin, because it’s always such a lift to the spirits to hear them burbling after a rainstorm. So, robins until Friday. –lambert * * * In Case You Might Miss… Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration “One Word Describes Trump” [The Atlantic]. “Weber wondered how the leaders of states derive legitimacy, the claim to rule rightfully. He thought it boiled down to two choices. One is rational legal bureaucracy (or “bureaucratic proceduralism”), a system in which legitimacy is bestowed by institutions following certain rules and norms. That is the American system we all took for granted until January 20. Presidents, federal officials, and military inductees swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a person. The other source of legitimacy is more ancient, more common, and more intuitive—’the default form of rule in the premodern world’ [Stephen E. Hanson, a government professor at the College of William & Mary, and Jeffrey S. Kopstein, a political scientist at UC Irvine] write. ‘The state was little more than the extended ‘household’ of the ruler; it did not exist as a separate entity.’ Weber called this system ‘patrimonialism’ because rulers claimed to be the symbolic father of the people—the state’s personification and protector…. In his day, Weber thought that patrimonialism was on its way to history’s scrap heap. Its personalized style of rule was too inexpert and capricious to manage the complex economies and military machines that, after Bismarck, became the hallmarks of modern statehood. Unfortunately, he was wrong. Patrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations. In its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader’s personal property or family business.” • Hmm. Patrimonialism seems akin to the Schmittian friend/enemy distinction. DOGE Elon out over his skis: “Email starts power clash between Musk and agency leaders — even the Trump loyalists” [Politico]. “Elon Musk’s weekend threat to federal workers triggered panic and confusion Sunday as administration officials rushed to issue sometimes conflicting guidance, setting in motion a power struggle between Musk and agency heads appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the federal government. The guidance varied by agency…. It’s the latest episode of Musk’s ‘move fast and break things’ philosophy clashing with the layers of rules and laws that fortify the bureaucracy he hopes to hobble. And it’s the first sign that even staunch Trump loyalists are beginning to flex their political muscle against Musk, an unelected ‘special government employee,’ whose power stems primarily from his proximity to the president.” • Hmm. Here is the letter: I have seen three explanations for this letter, besides sheer harassment (most employees I know of work in a chain of command; they certainly don’t need to report to Elon). (1) The letters will be fed into an AI, and keywords found will be used for firing; (2) the letters are a sorting device for stupid or loyal people, a la the Nigerian 419 fraud; (3) based on the request for that the worker’s managed be cc’ed, results would enable a more accurate, granular org chart of the Federal government to be constructed. “OPM’s Own Guidance Says Fed Employees Never Have to Respond to the Elon Emails” [Talking Points Memo]. “Notwithstanding that what amounts to a prank email has had the entire federal government debating with itself over the last 48 hours, Musk’s own Office of Personnel Management says that federal employees never have to respond to any of these emails. After landing at the Office of Personnel Management in January, DOGE operatives first order of business was to set up a new email system through which all federal employees could be emailed through a single distribution list. They built it on a new server system outside of the established government email system. But emails it sends come to civil servants from the email address HR at OPM dot gov. This new system was given the name Government-Wide Email System (GWES). On February 5th, 2025 — in other words, well after the Trump and more specifically Musk was in charge of OPM — OPM published this document, Privacy Impact Assessement for GWES. As you can see here, most specifically in sections 4.2 and 4.3, federal government employees are never obligated to respond to any GWES emails and are under no obligation to share any information. Indeed, section 4.3 says that to mitigate the risk that the federal employees may not realize this, every GWES email should ‘explicitly stat[e] that the response is voluntary.'” • BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!! Here are a few of the better “five bullets” letters, culled from the Intertubes: Here's one creative way @SecretService managers told agents to respond to Elon Musk's surprise email demanding hat fed employees list their 5 accomplishments last week. Sources said it was designed to avoid agents sharing sensitive and classified details of their work protecting… pic.twitter.com/3dSx9n0ayi — Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) February 23, 2025 And: I’m going to need five bullets on what you did this past week by morning. pic.twitter.com/SFR3bkU3Hg — Katie Mehnert (@katiemehnert) February 24, 2025 And (NSFW): pic.twitter.com/1YNJMXkizS — Josh Ellis (@jzellis) February 24, 2025 * * * “How Trump’s government-cutting moves risk exposing the CIA’s secrets” [CNN]. “The CIA is conducting a formal review to assess any potential damage from an unclassified email sent to the White House in early February that identified for possible layoffs some officers by first name and last initial and could’ve exposed the roles of people working undercover, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. That’s just one of multiple aftershocks from President Donald Trump’s push to take a jackhammer to the federal government – including the CIA. The administration’s efforts to cut the workforce and audit spending at the CIA and elsewhere threaten to jeopardize some of the government’s most sensitive work, current and former US officials familiar with internal deliberations say. And on the CIA’s 7th floor — home to top leadership — some officers are also quietly discussing how mass firings and the buyouts already offered to staff risk creating a group of disgruntled former employees who might be motivated to take what they know to a foreign intelligence service. Taken together, those actions highlight the depth of unease among career officials that Trump’s efforts to speedily slim down the US government may be putting American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers.” • So far, Trump — except for slapping those “50 intelligence officials” around for election interference — has left the spooks alone (presumably the generation of spook-related cover stories formerly undertaken by USAID will be moved to State). So is this story a message? A warning shot? What? “Despite the hype, DOGE hasn’t found a shred of fraud” [Public Notice]. “DOGE has claimed it’s rooted out $55 billion worth of spending, a dollar amount that appears to be wildly inaccurate: As of Sunday, DOGE’s website claims it has saved or cancelled $55 billion worth of government contracts. But that same website only accounts for $16 billion in contracts. Half of that comes from an $8 million government contract that DOGE incorrectly identified as being worth $8 billion. Additionally, DOGE has been in some cases simply cancelling contracts that the government has already paid for. Some $325 million in supposed savings are simply contracts that have been repeated in DOGE’s reporting, Politico found. But actual fraud? DOGE has found nothing. None of this has stopped Trump, Musk, congressional Republicans, and their allies in rightwing media from breathlessly highlighting millions of dollars’ worth of spending as examples of fraudulent government programs. Nowhere in those lists of programs — like the USAID initiatives that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been lambasting for weeks, including the tortured and incorrect claim that US taxpayers funded ‘condoms for Gaza’ — is anything that even Musk or Trump themselves have identified as ‘fraud.’ Instead, the goalposts for DOGE have silently moved from finding fraud and corruption to simply pointing out and cancelling government programs that Trump and Republicans simply don’t support.” • I kinda turned off following the detail on this story after Musk went all “Ghost of COBOL” on Social Security…. Democrats en déshabillé “AI video of Trump kissing Musk’s feet plays on TVs in HUD building” [The Register]. “A video produced using artificial intelligence (AI) showing President Trump rubbing and kissing Elon Musk’s feet played on television screens in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) building Monday in an apparent mocking of the relationship between the two men. The words ‘Long live the real king’ were displayed over the top of the computer-generated video, a reference to Trump’s Truth Social post last week in which he wrote, ‘Long Live the King!’ The Hill obtained a photo of the screens in the HUD building as the video was playing.” • Here’s the video: On Monday morning, TV sets at the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development played the seemingly AI-generated video on loop, along with the words “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.” Read the full article: https://t.co/TYHyCUUqvV pic.twitter.com/dHRjnmVes6 — WIRED (@WIRED) February 24, 2025 I fail to understand the extraordinary hold this trope has on the liberal Democrat mind; it began, or at least was normalized, in a series in The New York Times back in 2018. Liberals seem to believe that the trope is an enormous “own” of conservatives. In fact, it shows that for liberalism — hold onto your hats, here, folks — tribalism trumps principle. In what other context would the “In this house….” rainbow-flag crowd treat gay lovers as anything other than worthy of praise, indeed emulation? But bring in a demon figure, and the deep triggers go off…. “Angry Democratic donors turn off the flow of money” [The Hill]. “Democratic donors — from bundlers to small dollar donors — say they are still angry about the election results and uninspired by anything their side has put forward since then. ‘I’ll be blunt here: The Democratic Party is f‑‑‑ing terrible. Plain and simple,’ one major Democratic donor said. ‘In fact, it doesn’t get much worse.’ A second donor was equally as pointed. ‘They want us to spend money, and for what? For no message, no organization, no forward thinking. … The thing that’s clear to a lot of us is that the party never really learned its lesson in 2016. They worked off the same playbook and the same ineffective strategies and to what end?'” • The party did great in 2016 and 2020. They crippled the left, and that’s their main goal as a party, right? Stop whining, donors! You never had it so good! “Carville suggests Trump admin will ‘collapse’ within 30 days” [The Hill]. “Democratic strategist James Carville suggested the Trump administration will ‘collapse’ within 30 days as the public reacts to the sweeping actions from the executive branch. ‘I believe that this administration, in less than 30 days, is in the midst of a massive collapse and particularly a collapse in public opinion,’ Carville said during a conversation with Mediaite’s Dan Abrams about the Trump administration’s unprecedented recent actions. Abrams asked Carville to clarify what he meant, to confirm that Carville believes the administration will crumble shortly. ‘It’s collapsing right now. We’re in the midst of a collapse,’ Carville replied. ‘This is the lowest approval, not even close, that any president has ever had at a comparable time.'” • This is cope. Not buying it. And if I did, it would be bad: The Democrats must suffer much, much more before there is any change, inside or outside the party. Republican Funhouse Maybe: Voters are mostly liking what they see in the first month of the new presidency. By 57/43 voters say Trump doing a better job than Biden in advance look at poll coming out Monday. Job approval at 52 but closing the border, cutting waste are hugely popular. So is resetting merit… — Mark Penn (@Mark_Penn) February 23, 2025 I’d certainly give the Trump administration more than Carville’s thirty days, though. Realignment and Legitimacy “Monopoly Round-Up: The Populist Revolt Against Oligarchy Begins” [Matt Stoller, BIG]. why choose to focus on Bernie Sanders giving speeches on how he doesn’t like the superrich? I mean, yawn. Right? But something about this campaign is different. It’s not so much what Bernie is saying, it’s that he is doing it to overflow crowds in Nebraska and Iowa. And it’s not just event crowds, his videos are getting tens of millions of views, and his online campaign metrics are performing remarkably well. I got a note from a contact in Bernie-world, who told me that ‘The level of engagement is higher than the last presidential.’ Democratic operatives who have traditionally disliked Bernie are noting what he’s doing, approvingly. Even billionaire Mark Cuban, who hates populism, is calling Bernie’s approach ‘really smart.’ …. This anti-big business vibe isn’t necessarily channeling itself through the Democrats, who are deeply loathed and distrusted…. What’s important about what Bernie is doing, and these other signals, is he might be showing that fear of oligarchy is the dominant view of a large swath of the public. If that’s the case, a lot of things could change, and quicker than we might imagine.” • (Readers; Please keep the Bernie grousing to a minimum. We know all those points by heart.) What I want to know is why Sanders is the only one at the podium. Let’s get some new faces up there!

Measles “Former FDA chief ‘very concerned’ about Texas measles outbreak spreading” [The Hill]. “Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said he is ‘very concerned’ about the measles outbreak in Texas spreading…. He noted that he believes it ‘will spread.’ ‘There’s been 100 cases that have been identified so far,’ Gottlieb said. ‘There’s probably many more than that. ‘So, I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases and could take many months to try to fully snuff out,’ he added. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed at least 90 cases of measles and said 16 patients were hospitalized. Just five of the patients were vaccinated…. Gottleib also noted that there could be economic impacts from the spread of measles, as other countries could place the U.S. under a travel advisory. ‘The risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread, even at a low level,’ Gottlieb said.” Treatment: Covid “Demographic Variation In US Outpatient Hydroxychloroquine And Ivermectin Use During The COVID-19 Pandemic” [RAND]. “Using insurance claims from the MedInsight Emerging Experience Research Database for 8.1 million patients from all fifty US states, we evaluated COVID-19-associated outpatient hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin use and spending throughout the public health emergency (January 30, 2020-May 11, 2023) versus pre-public health emergency rates. …. The combined overall hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin utilization rate was threefold higher in older versus younger adults. Ivermectin use was greater among patients with the highest versus the lowest degree of social vulnerability and in the southern US versus other regions.” Origins Debate “What sparked the COVID pandemic?

The calls come after an incident in 2021 where the main cargo door of a DHL-operated Boeing 757 converted freighter opened mid-flight. In the incident in question, the aircraft failed to pressurize following a routine departure from DHL’s European hub located at Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEI) in Germany. Although the crew onboard was aware of the pressurization issue, it was only later discovered that the main deck cargo door had failed to latch correctly, leading to its uncommanded opening in flight.” • Since 2021….

Tech: “AI-designed chips are so weird that ‘humans cannot really understand them’ — but they perform better than anything we’ve created” [LiveScience]. “Although the findings suggest that the design of such complex chips could be handed over to AI, Sengputa was keen to point out that pitfalls remain ‘that still require human designers to correct.’ In particular, many of the designs produced by the algorithm did not work– equivalent to the ‘hallucinations’ produced by current generative AI tools. ‘The point is not to replace human designers with tools,’ said Sengputa. ‘The point is to enhance productivity with new tools.'” • That’s what management always says. At first. Tech: A classic “Smiley’s People” scene, but with a AI slop added: Always worth watching. But take a look: Every day, in every way, AI makes us more stupid. (Sure, there are use cases.

News of the Wired “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” [Cory Doctorow]. Well worth reading in full, but here is the heart of the matter: “HP’s enshittificatory impulses run wild. They hunt relentlessly for ways to make things worse for their customers in order to make things better for themselves. Last week, they came up with a humdinger, even by their own standards. They announced that people who called their customer service line would be subject to mandatory 15-minute waits, even if there was a rep who was free to talk with them…. During this mandatory 15-minute wait, customers would be bombarded with a recorded voice demanding that they solve their problems by consulting HP’s website and its awful chatbots. In a competitive market, businesses can contain their customer service costs by making better products. In a monopolistic market like the printer racket, companies can deliberately introduce maddening antifeatures to their products, and then fob off the customers who reach such a peak of frustrated rage that they resort to calling a customer support number on chatbot that will use its spicy autocomplete to hallucinate nonexistent drivers and imaginary troubleshooting steps…. Within a day of Paul Kunert breaking the story in The Register, HP had reversed its policy, citing ‘feedback’ (a corporate euphemism that means ‘fury’). This is a rare win for the forces of disenhittification and it deserves recognition. It turns out that in these Mangionean times, companies can actually be bullied into comporting themselves with marginally less sleaze and cruelty. It’s especially noteworthy that this took place in the UK, where Prime Minister Kier Starmer has invited tech companies to pick Britons’ pockets without fear of consequence, by firing the top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK.” • Yay!

The calls come after an incident in 2021 where the main cargo door of a DHL-operated Boeing 757 converted freighter opened mid-flight. In the incident in question, the aircraft failed to pressurize following a routine departure from DHL’s European hub located at Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEI) in Germany. Although the crew onboard was aware of the pressurization issue, it was only later discovered that the main deck cargo door had failed to latch correctly, leading to its uncommanded opening in flight.” • Since 2021….

News of the Wired “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” [Cory Doctorow]. Well worth reading in full, but here is the heart of the matter: “HP’s enshittificatory impulses run wild. They hunt relentlessly for ways to make things worse for their customers in order to make things better for themselves. Last week, they came up with a humdinger, even by their own standards. They announced that people who called their customer service line would be subject to mandatory 15-minute waits, even if there was a rep who was free to talk with them…. During this mandatory 15-minute wait, customers would be bombarded with a recorded voice demanding that they solve their problems by consulting HP’s website and its awful chatbots. In a competitive market, businesses can contain their customer service costs by making better products. In a monopolistic market like the printer racket, companies can deliberately introduce maddening antifeatures to their products, and then fob off the customers who reach such a peak of frustrated rage that they resort to calling a customer support number on chatbot that will use its spicy autocomplete to hallucinate nonexistent drivers and imaginary troubleshooting steps…. Within a day of Paul Kunert breaking the story in The Register, HP had reversed its policy, citing ‘feedback’ (a corporate euphemism that means ‘fury’). This is a rare win for the forces of disenhittification and it deserves recognition. It turns out that in these Mangionean times, companies can actually be bullied into comporting themselves with marginally less sleaze and cruelty. It’s especially noteworthy that this took place in the UK, where Prime Minister Kier Starmer has invited tech companies to pick Britons’ pockets without fear of consequence, by firing the top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK.” • Yay!

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. May you sail into your future on calm seas, with propitious winds and pleasant, sunny days. Thank you, especially for the “propitious winds” part (me being watchful of whatever is airborne).

The Atlantic article and Weber’s patrimonialism is utterly anti-historic. In Mesopotamia, the ruler’s household — the palace economy — was corporately distinct, as were the temples (usually close to the ruler). The economy at large was governed by common law on the land. So it was a bifurcated (or better, trifurcated) economy. The state emerged only in classical antiquity. Not in anthropological societies, where the chieftain’s household also was distinct. Awesome, thanks! It was the Schmittian aspect that appealed to me. Did the friend/enemy distinction appear as the key aspect of politics back in Mesopotamia? I have no notion of how that discourse would have appeared, or even if States in those days conceived of “politics” as we do, so perhaps that is a very stupid question. Schmitt’s theorizing on the friend/enemy distinction appears based on his philosophical decision about human nature not the historical development and evolution of the State. “Because the sphere of the political is in the final analysis determined by the real possibility of enmity, political conceptions and ideas cannot very well start with an anthropological optimism. This would dissolve the possibility of enmity, and thereby, every specific political consequence.” See Carl Schmitt, (The Concept of the Political), pg. 64 That HUD video seems especially stupid, aside from just being dumb – unless all those people were just fired and not worried about use of resources, connecting to 3rd parry tools, if HQ means an area where the public could walk in then public presentation without authorization, etc etc that would get me fired from my private sector job. Who the heck knows why the libs think that deploying gay fetishist images are the way to troll the quote unquote fascists into submission. It’s projection. And infuriating. Thanks for pointing this out. My brain shut off with “disgusting” and refused to delve deeper. ive never understood the foot fetish thing,lol. i mean, to each his own…and Tam’s pinky toes were tiny and bent and cute and all…but man! to reify feet thataway… i wonder at the psychology of it. I never got a boner from feet, myself. democratic culture seems to consist entirely of ad hominem “owns” of republicans. i find it to be deeply frustrating, and exacerbated by the internet. (it’s a lot easier to make fun of people who you don’t actually know, and there are no repercussions, only ingroup praise.) they think it’s funny to “turn the republicans own weapons against them,” when really it’s just one giant bullyish name calling match. a lot of the people i hung out with this weekend spoke of trump and republicans in a really mocking sense. mostly online young women in their 20s. one of them told me about a tiktok trend called “republican makeup” (link for reference) where people put on “foundation that is the wrong color and overlined lips”, while democrat makeup was “like actually good makeup.” which reminded me of the “our blessed nyc clean girl aesthetic vs their barbarous southern beauty queen aesthetic” meme. i am reaching the point where i am just going to ignore everyone who acts like that if i can. because me going “erm thats dumb actually” feels like it’s contributing to the cycle. What is a bit disturbing today is two or three of the screen grabs I have seen from the NSA and what the employees were discussing online in an open forum at the agency. Very inappropriate for work. It is also a bit disgusting to me – not everyone who has had the work they described is happy with the results – there are those in my practice who are in constant misery all day. I am no prude. In my life and my line of work, I have heard it all. But that does not mean this is appropriate to be placed on an open forum at work. Had I done anything like that all the way through my career up into the present day – I would have been terminated immediately. I know that because it has happened several times to others in my life – for far far less than what was done at HUD and what was released from NSA today. The HUD tape and now the NSA forum – the kid last year doing the OnlyFans on Amy Klobuchar’s desk in the Senate committee room…..I can go on and on…… What is wrong with these people? Why do they think this kind of behavior is OK? Here, read some history: Triggering the Libs. I never know if people who only quote one side of the food fight were particularly online in the last yen years, where a lot of this originated. Anyway, I always think about Thomas Frank’s masterpiece, Make Them Cry. Now that people believe that the state is mostly unable to deliver positive outcomes for people, they’ve decided to use virality and state power, if possible, to punish and upset their enemies. I think there may be one big difference – this Dem was so “triggered” by much of what was done in the past 4 years not by random online people but by actual employees and staffers of Dem congresspeople and agencies that it really turned me off to the whole Dem architecture in DC. As in really making me believe they need a break from power. Random online people are not the same as employees and staffers. No, no difference. Why? Those people who started it online on the right are now in power so I think the point stands. The Thiel network is staffed through with groypers and Very Online People, including our VP Vance and most of the DOGE main characters. Elon’s Hitler salute was a classic lib-owning 4-chan bit, even saying that “he is become meme.” Life is now a crummy mirror of the posting wars of the last decade where the group in power gets to punish the others. I don’t think we could honestly look at 2021 and say that Trump world handles COVID substantially better than Biden world, and the fact that we get to live through this farce is heartbreaking. Those online people (groypers and alt right) are now the ones in power, punishing their enemies and privatizing the government so the cycle of Making Them Cry continues. The current application of Making Them Cry is a bright shiny squirrel object to divert attention from the deeper longer-range agenda of bankrupting and largely destroying the US government and selling off every publicly owned asset ( all the National Parks, all the National Wildlife Refuges, all the National Forests, all the BLM lands, all the Taylor Act Grazing lands, all the TVA/BPA/CVA/VA/Social Security/USPS etc. assets), and everything else of monetizable value to the Republicans’ social class allies, social class and personal cronies and masters. And the purpose of terminating government functionality is also to make every upper class crime functionally legal in practice. MAPLA! ( Make All Pollution Legal Again) and so forth. Their eyes are on the prize and Making Us Cry is a ploy on their part to keep us busy and distracted. I read somewhere that that video was not an HUD video . . . . not authored and placed by HUD people . . . but was placed there by an outside hacker. Has anyone else read different? How long did the HUD computer people leave it up there before taking it down? And if Musk’s little dogees locked the HUD people out of their own computers and then an outside hacker got in and put it there, but the HUD people were still locked out, what exactly would the HUD people have been supposed to have been able to do about it? >How long did the HUD computer people leave it up there before taking it down? And if Musk’s little dogees locked the HUD people out of their own computers and then an outside hacker got in and put it there, but the HUD people were still locked out, what exactly would the HUD people have been supposed to have been able to do about it? Another question then is,” what else did an outside hacker do while in the system?” Demodogs doing what they do best. Roll Over. https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/2/24/2305887/-Top-Democrat-proves-useless-as-Musk-makes-more-chaotic-demands?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=top_news_slot_1&pm_medium=web Carried by the orange monster. It sounds like this particular Democrat is not just rolling over. This particular Democrat is a secret Republican agent and probably a secret Trump and Musk asset of influence. Any individual Democratic officeholder who is an effective and functional part of an actual successful effort to derail and delay and hopefully destroy some part of the TrumpenMusk program would be worth retaining in office. Any individual Democratic officeholder who is not successful ( even if they try or pretend to try) is best quietly and unemotionally abandoned to whatever fate awaits it. Time and attention are scarce and precious, and any time and attention . . . even negative time and attention . . . given to such people is diverted away from achieving something real. Individual Democratic Senators would be easy enough to assess for effectiveness. At the very least, a DemSen could put a Tuberville hold on Bongino for Assistant FBI Director. And keep that Hold locked in place as long as Senate Rules allow. That is just an example of the Obstructionary tools which individual Senators do have at their disposal, without regard to what their ” Minority Leader” might think or want. And if the Republican TrumpenMusk plan is to run the government to fast-forward destruction, then Democratic officeholders could be the ones to shut the government all the way down in March and keep it shut down as long as the TrumpenMusk Republicans want a 4 trillion dollar debt increase to match a 4 trillion dollar tax cut in order to liquidate the Government sooner so as to sell off every public asset of every kind to private buyers. If the Democratic Officeholders do not shut the government down and keep it shut down to the end this Congress if necessary in order to slow the Trump Train down, then they would be best not thought about any more. People would have to try learning to live in a “no-more-National Democrats” world. Re: HP and De-enshittification I love the term “enshittificatory” – ha! I suggest another term – “enshittifigenic” … as in, thanks to private equity and greased AI we live in an enshittifigenic environment. I have to admit in my line of work we spent a lot on HP Test and Measurement equipment. We worked closely with them my whole career (later on it was Agilent Technologies, and then Keysight.) Their people were top notch. The equipment was the gold standard for test, data acquisition, and control. They were a big part of what I consider the old Silicon Valley to be all about – technical competence, world class support, and a minimum of BS. This thing they call HP today – I don’t see any of that anymore. Sad. The American Robin was the first bird I identified as a child. It may be common but is still special. Lambert: Thank you for all your contributions over the years. From articles to links to Water Cooler, I feel so much better informed about what is going on in the world thanks in part to you. Your links and information on Covid was so important at a time of chaos. Thank you, thank you, thank you for writing for Naked Capitalism. You will be missed! Agree with everything you said. Thanks for everything, Lambert! Same here. You will be missed. Agreed! Of all places to locate words of wisdom, in an early movie scene of Scarface you have Frank the cocaine boss providing advice to the young new hire, Tony Montana…” Don’t get high on your supply…”. The more this cost cutting effort goes ahead in an increasingly wild pattern, it looks like Musk is possibly violating this rule and being a bit too high and strong on his very own power sources whatever form they might be… Eventually some department heads just needed to push back, even moderately so. You can’t lead a department amid a mass exodus and mass personnel changes….well you can I suppose; people who somehow stay or stick it out really should maintain some outside recruiting contacts. As I recall there was a data science / IT technical leader who commented on being let go during a previous round of cost cutting, hope they’re finding some green pasture afterwards. Cost cutting…does sound better than wielding the proverbial axe through bureaucracy, but only a moderate improvement. This all looks like mere chaos from the cheap seats. At some point, possibly far sooner than our Boer settler colonialist friend suspects, Trump is going to have to weigh whether the money he’s making thanks to Musk compensates for lost attention and, eventually, pushback from his base and the broader public. Musk has his incel s^*+heel legion, but they could be put down if so desired. Hard to imagine Musk’s competing megalomania and antics not annoying Trump before long. A couple of things about the above articles – the measles article – and the ivermectin/HCQ article. First of all – there are some very interesting standouts as far as deviations from norms in the measles outbreak. The rate of hospitalization is extremely higher than what would be expected – and that is giving me some real concerns. My guess is that this is being spread among people who are not the healthiest to begin with- and that may be driving this. Even more interesting is the constant use of the word “unknown” when referring to the “unvaccinated”. Just so everyone will know, the use of the word “unknown” especially in the numbers it seems to be being used in this issue – is a kind of medical code word that is often specifically used for immigrants. Their vaccination status for pretty much anything is truly unknown and this is especially true after the past 4 years of no-screening wide open borders. All immigrants during the past 4 years were forced to be COVID vaccinated – despite the fact that it is a non-sterilizing vaccine incapable of preventing transmission – all the while their measles status, among others, was never checked nor were they forced to be vaccinated for it. I have had my share of unscreened immigrants in the past 2 years with all kinds of medical infectious disease issues. I have screened every last one of them for many infectious issues including measles. Every last one had negative measles antibodies – meaning they had never been vaccinated. I have vaccinated them all. BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE BORDER. Just think how much more common sense would have been had – if instead of mandating COVID vaccines which do nothing for transmission – vaccines for measles and other things THAT DO MAKE A DIFERENCE would have been mandated. It is called public health 101. My understanding of this, although all rumor and hearsay, is that immigrants were the nidus of this – but then it spread into some kind of non-vaccinating religious community, I think Mennonite – but not sure – and then exploded. Regardless – do yourselves a favor and have your kids and grandkids make sure they had MMR. Furthermore – as an adult – if you were immunized decades ago, you may be surprised that your immunity has worn off. GET CHECKED. I did – and I was found to be “inderminate” for measles immunity – so I was vaccinated again. I immediately turned off the IVM/HCQ article when they said right off the bat it was for insurance claims only….Huh? – They must have slept through the entire pandemic, especially the part where pharmacy chains et al were blacklisting docs and reporting them to boards etc. An overwhelming predominance of my patients that were using it were getting it from veterinary sources and other under the table methods. Insurance claims? Really? If that is the method they were using – it has WAY WAY undercounted the usage. And I can assure you in my world – there was no lower class predominance. The border vaccination policy you describe is shocking. I was recently surprised to learn that a measles infection comes with a bonus: it compromises immunological memory so that one is rendered vulnerable to reinfection by diseases that one would otherwise have protected from by the adaptive immune system. From Wikipedia: The measles virus can deplete previously acquired immune memory by killing cells that make antibodies, and thus weakens the immune system, which can cause deaths from other diseases.[42][43][44] Suppression of the immune system by measles lasts about two years and has been epidemiologically implicated in up to 90% of childhood deaths in third world countries, and historically may have caused rather more deaths in the United States, the UK and Denmark than were directly caused by measles.[94] Although the measles vaccine contains an attenuated strain, it does not deplete immune memory.[43] I made a misstatement in my above discussion – It should say “All LEGAL immigrants were forced to have the COVID vaccine” – it is very clear that in the chaos at the border where the illegal immigrants were concerned – there was no effort to worry about any vaccination. Nidus = “Medicine: a place in which bacteria have multiplied or may multiply; a focus of infection.” Sorry for the jargon – I try my best but it sometimes escapes. And just FYI, medical jargon terms are often not really associated with their underlying meaning. I have been fascinated by the attempts of AI to reproduce this as if it was a real clinician. This is often hilarious to read. A nidus is the source of infection in a body – in epidemiological terms – a nidus is often ironically used to refer to the patient zero type individuals – the source of the epidemic. “Sorry for the jargon ” I think you are beyond splendid, and was only setting down a dictionary meaning. “FYI, medical jargon terms are often not really associated with their underlying meaning. I have been fascinated by the attempts of AI to reproduce this as if it was a real clinician…” https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202502/1328947.shtml February 23, 2025 Local governments, hospitals in China embrace DeepSeek AI helps assisting public service hotline, medical record management By Li Yawei and Liang Rui A growing number of cities in China are embracing the innovative applications of DeepSeek, with some integrating it into government services to streamline repetitive tasks and hospitals leveraging it for preliminary patient diagnostics. A Chinese AI expert noted that DeepSeek serves as an assistant to enhance productivity, yet humans’ comprehensive practical abilities remain beyond DeepSeek’s reach… Nidus. Latin for nest ==> French, le nid. Joining in the etymology-fest: The term “nidicolous” is also used to refer to birds who stay in the nest until grown, and also used to describe other species that mainly occupy nests of other animals, as in “nidicolous mites” or other “nidicoles” that specialize in parasitizing nesting birds and mammals. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DRWK January 15, 2018 Life Expectancy at Birth for China and Mexico, 2000-2022 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DRWM January 30, 2018 Infant Mortality Rate for China and Mexico, 2000-2022 Thanks Doc. We movie fans know that one of the functions of Ellis Island was to check the health status of immigrants and possibly reject them on that basis. Hence the “island.” Disease management going backwards? And of course during Covid port of entry NYC was one of the origin regions for the USA. Whatever one thinks of Musk our government managers seem to have lots of competence gaps. Shouldn’t they be hiring while they are firing? ” Shouldn’t they be hiring while they are firing”? Only if maintainance of government function while improving it is Musk’s goal. But if Musk’s goal is to destroy these government departments and agencies, then firing should outrun hiring. And Ideally hiring would be zero while doing the firing so as to destroy the targeted departments and agencies soonest. Since that is what Musk is doing, it would appear that ‘ closing competence gaps’ is not the goal here. The NIH says measles immunity from vaccines starts falling after 10-15 years! https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8189124/ Plus the MMR vaccine is a live (attenuated virus) vaccine and those generally strengthen the immune system (I have become a live vaccine fetishist). Where I am, getting a measles titer test costs more than the vaccine (and my insurance does not cover either). I could almost certainly talk my regular MD into Rxing an MMR vaccine again. Is there any reason not to do that (as long as you space it out in relation to other vaccines or interventions)? To put it another way, shouldn’t everyone over 50 assume they need an MMR vaccine again? The word disenshittification is the main thing that’s always irked me about his attempt to enhance his brand with a new word, when crapification has been a perfectly complete, and more sensible, word since the last century. Petty? Perhaps. (Probably.) The backpedalling has begun, but with hints of more mayhem to come: Elon Musk makes an admission about the productivity email his group sent to federal workers Elon Musk said that blanket emails sent to federal employees asking for a response about their weekly accomplishments or risk termination was a test to see if they “had a pulse.” Less than 24 hours before the deadline, Musk hinted that the emails were simply a ruse to ensure federal employees were “capable of responding” to his correspondence. “This was basically a check to see if the employee had a pulse and was capable of replying to an email,” Musk said. “This mess will get sorted out this week. Lot of people in for a rude awakening and strong dose of reality. They don’t get it yet, but they will.” On Sunday afternoon, Musk also referred to the emails as a “very basic pulse check.” That evening, Musk added that a response was indicative that employees have “two working neurons.” I think the degree of future mayhem depends on who/what was behind the backtracking. Musk hates to look a fool, and right now he does in spades. You can tell by his childish response. Since Musk is a significant driver of this stuff, and it is moving faster than any legacy systems or people can keep up, then it becomes up to individuals, along and/or in groups, to figure out how to cause Musk maximal pain so fast as to divert his energy from the great work of dismantling governance. How can millions of people destroy Tesla and force it into quick liquidation all over the world? How many people would have to leave twitterX and/or boycott all its advertisers until they leave it, in order to steer twitterX into a shrinkage spiral and then a death spiral? Thanks. He also sent an email saying the month is up and those not back in offices from work at home would be fired. Presumably another “just kidding” missive? Musk needs a muzzle. Why does Musk need a muzzle? Let Musk be Musk. Let it all hang out. Let people get a good strong whiff of the Musk-man’s true smell. From “a critical care physician and medical director of intensive care units in federal, local and rural hospitals, I am in part a government employee”: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-02-24/doge-office-of-personnel-management-uc-san-diego-veterans-affairs/ The man-children in charge still won’t respect what this doctor does or feel happiness at care brought to patients. They still think AI will do it better. Dealing with certified empathy challenged people who were selected for those traits. It is not just the federal government. This doctor is having many of the same complaints that any doctor in America working for private equity has. Here’s the latest outburst from DOGElon with commentary. https://www.reddit.com/r/1102/comments/1ix0sif/another_tweet_by_musk_about_rto/ Due to office space constraints, many federal agencies have not been able to find space for all of their teleworking and remote work employees, some of whom live thousands of miles from their head quarters. According to Musk, it appears that these individuals will be put on administrative leave and presumably laid off in 60 days. “Bad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.” –Thomas Frank I wonder what Elon will do when he realizes that the US Patent and Trademark Office is about 90 percent remote, including almost all patent examiners. Would be tragic if all Tesla (car company) and SpaceX patents were permanently deleted. Irrecoverably lost. Just gone. Not on Google, not anywhere. It could be an organized hack, who knows? Many government workers don’t have offices to go back to because it was management that sent them home. I’ve already read stories about mass layoffs in the US PTO on LinkedIn. Looks like there won’t be as many of them to rubber stamp tech bros patents … Are you sure they’re not talking about new hires who got their start date delayed or people who took the “Fork”? Nothing about a mass layoff https://www.reddit.com/r/patentexaminer/ Lambert – I don’t know if you realize how your postings and curations over these many years have been what seems now as an irreplaceable window into the realities of the world. It’s been really fabulous. If this is actually the last day, it is then a very sad day. May you flourish wherever you are destined! >If this is actually the last day, it is then a very sad day. May you flourish wherever you are destined! Indeed, as grey a day as can be in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire if it is a last day. And yes, may you flourish wherever you are destined. Thank you! Friday! I have things to wrap up for this whole week I hope you include Christmas wrapping paper as you are (soon to be were) a wonderful gift. AKA you dah mahn! Lambert, Please make a website and help organize us into Local Third Parties! The Conjurer, A reminder to us not to get caught up focusing on the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Lambert, I am going to miss your ability to see beyond the mirrors, and your dry wit flogging of our betters. Whatever your plans may be, I’m confident they will be executed in style with deserving beneficiaries. Fare you well. ps, robins were my mom’s favorite. Friday! Friday. In a different timeline I would insist on standing you a pint or five. Thanks for everything. It’s been a good run. Is there a place we can go to follow you? Or are you opting out to pursue other adventures? After you have had a good long well-earned rest, I hope you decide to figure out how to overcome your dislike of work when it comes to gardening. If we are approaching a future where ” the food you cannot grow is the food you will not have” . . . then you may well want to protect your future survivability against that future. That’s not an assignment, just a hope and a wish. Cheers, Mazel Tov and Cent Anni to Lambert! >>>What I want to know is why Sanders is the only one at the podium. Let’s get some new faces up there Perhaps he is the designated Judas goat? And despite being almost as supine as most other politicians, he still has more of a spine than most of them? Maybe the “party” feels that Sanders actually had an email list of people who supported him, and thus he should get out there; no one else can even claim to have a popular following. I note that I received not one but two different spam text this past weeks: “Bernie here”. Yeah, sure. I now live in Iowa so maybe it was a way of hyping the rallies in PMC Fooballville (aka Iowa City). I was angry at Sanders after he dropped out in 2020. Now I just feel sorry for him having to carry water for such horrible people, to no apparent purpose, and with no possible benefits. I’ll be missing you weekday afternoons. Along with all of the substantive things Lambert has shared, and all of the substantive comments people will make in farewell, I have been grateful for all of the Clash references. ‘Ignore Alien Orders!’ And Woody Guthrie’s guitar isn’t the only machine capable of killing fascists. Thanks to the team here at NC. It is ok to hear that Sanders has followers. I guess he most people only realistic option to completely selling out. I haven’t seen any positive talk about him anywhere else or encountered any of his supporters on any of the mastodon social media i usually inhabit. I have seen things for Jill Stein, De LA Cruz etc. Lambert, thank you again for all the hard work, sophisticated explanations, and sacrifice you have given to helping knit together this wonderful website! We will miss your daily presence, and hopefully will still enjoy guest returns from time to time. Lambert – thank you for all that you have done. You have not only enlightened people – I think you have done much to save their sanity. To Lambert : Thank you for all your work and all the best in your future endeavors. RE: why Sanders is the only one at the podium Because if actual members of the Democrat party were there too, the “good billionaires” like Pritzker and Soros might have a sad. And we can’t have that lest donations be cut. The spice must flow! Lambert, not sure what you’re remaining schedule is, but thanks for everything over the years! “Your” – it wouldn’t do to allow the typo in my potentially final comment to you in WC to go unremarked. I’ve admired your meticulous grammar over many years! Lambert: masc. proper name, from French, from German Lambert, from Old High German Lambreht, from lant “land” (see land (n.)) + beraht “bright” (from PIE root *bhereg- “to shine; bright, white.”). Plantidotes and John Singer Sargent. Everything begins to make sense. https://youtu.be/lWA2pjMjpBs?si=KzwL4OCH3Io-QY0n Lambert: sharper than any diamond Your last day? Say it ain’t so! You are the very model of a Moderator General, You’ve information vegetable, animal, and mineral, You know the chiefs in Congress, and you quote the fights historical, From Medicare to Labor laws, in order categorical; Paging Edward Gorey, nice one f. Farewell, thou greatest of hamster wranglers Bosch, Smiley, Sparky the raccoon dog…. Gonna miss you Lambert. Thanks so much. Elon’s “five bullets” email debacle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yeah, one bullet is all you need when playing Russian Roulette~ Lambert, It’s been fun having you around with your keen sense of chiaroscuro, and a celebration is in order! Happy trails… Thank you for everything, Lambert, and do take care. Happy trails! If you’re ever near Hanover I’d be honored to buy you lunch and a beverage of your choice. Lambert – many will be referencing your files into the future. Take care. Wishing you well, Lambert. I’m an appreciative lurker. You rock! https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/covid-virus-evolution/681798/ COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution “But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.” I vaguely recall this being discussed on NC early in the outbreak. No? It may have been during those conversations where there seemed to be much amazement at how much previous science about viruses seemed to have went out the window. Maybe a post or two. “And if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than 50 mutations—an astounding evolutionary leap. ” And the timing of that…brings something else to mind. “COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution” Please set down the science reference, if possible. I can find no journal publication reference. I didn’t write the article. Just looked like they were talking about something scientists weren’t aware of and I’m trying to remember where it seems like I heard that discussed before. “I didn’t write the article.” I am grateful for the mention of the article, but an article about scientific findings should immediately reference those findings. I am in no way challenging the post, but absent journal-published scientific findings I have no way of judging the article. Thank you so much. (Remember…) > That same month, a preprint from a group led by Ravindra Gupta The link at preprint leads to: : Neutralising antibodies in Spike mediated SARS-CoV-2 adaptation I have a long time frustration with The Atlantic’s Covid coverage. i remember something about that, as well…but Toffler’s information overload applies Lambert, I will really miss you, a lot lot! May you find new adventure on the high seas, but always remember to return home… hope we will hear from you around here once in awhile, but if this is really your quiet grand finale, then thank you ever so much Bosch! I’m so happy to see this. So much to unpack in it as always. Thank you Lambert. Tossing this out there. Acknowledging the questionable nature of the analogy, but Musk’s Legions of Decency and Economy could be equated with Ernst Roem’s Brownshirts of the early days of the NASDAP in interwar Germany. Will Trump have to stage his own version of the ‘Night of the Long Knives?’ (After the Muskshirts have done their wrecking chores. What would Kristallnacht look like on the Internet?) In this case, Trump, or his successor, already has an Enabling Act in place, thanks to the spineless Politicos of Washington. The above is not strictly snark Happy trails Lambert. I will miss you. Labor activism. When the enforcers strike, what does that mean? More than 6,500 National Guard personnel on duty as wildcat NY prison strike continues syracuse.com More than 6,500 National Guard personnel were on duty Monday to help run the New York state prison system as an illegal strike by corrections officers entered its second week. … Strikes by government employees are illegal under a section of state Civil Service Law commonly known as the Taylor Law. The current contract with the corrections officers union took effect in 2023 and lasts through next year. The involvement of the National Guard is similar to a two-week strike in 1979 when guard personnel ran prisons with the State Police. “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” There must be a movement against that kind of thing. It could be called antidisenshittificationism, a new spelling bee word. Anyway wouldn’t the HP action be deshittification? Other: I hadn’t heard about raccoon dogs before. I only knew about wiener dogs. Lambert, OMG just catching up with earlier comments. I’m going to miss you. Make sure to check in with your NC homies here now and then. Bizarre – I’m just noticing now after years, that Gonzalo Lira (the US journalist passed/killed by Ukraine) had a pretty bad dust-up with Steve Keen a decade ago – I had even contacted Steve at the time to let him know of a ‘website malfunction’ caused by the aftermath of this, and learned of Lira’s involvement then (without knowing anything about him then). Weird how short the degrees of separation are – I see he has had stuff cross-posted here at NC at times, as well, ‘back in the day’. Moving to USA as a Brit is bewildering in many ways. Finding out that the American robin is a completely different bird was one. Beautiful :) Re: hanging up the Yellow Waders? But where to hang them? Some artistic placement is needed. Best wishes Lambert! Thanks for all the conversation and links over the years. I hope your next endeavor is everything you want it to be. Re the “patrimonialism” piece, the thing to note is that the Weberian state was always an ideal, not ever a real thing, even if we came closer to it every now and then. As an academic acquaintance put it, “meritocracy” simply meant people who have “merit” (whatever that is) get the right to give stuff to their friends via government. The real question, as I see it, is whether people who don’t have this “merit” can recognize this as something worth yielding to? Are the “meritorious” so powerful that they can’t be challenged? (This would be the unstable path) Or, do they produce such public benefit, even if it’s not their primary goal, that the masses are willing to tolerate them? (This is actually Mancur Olson’s argument–more important insight than the collective action stuff, I think.) This runs counter to what “meritocrats” today think “merit” means–just credentials, whether they actually produce anything useful, or not–actual raw power through which they can assert their rule or something useful for enough others so that they would tolerate your rule.). So today’s meritocrats are just bandits, not the bandits with some “redeeming” values that Olson saw. This cannot be a stable thing…. In regard to Musk’s 5 points email, they are explicitly stating that they will use LLM Artificial Intelligence to review the responses. This almost certainly means Musk’s Grok. It seems to me that one could explicitly poison the AI with responses. BUT THAT WOULD BE WRONG, THAT’S FOR SURE!!!! Your email address will not be published.

Title: Ultimate Alexa Guide: 200+ Voice Commands to Master Your Amazon Echo

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement With the right commands, your Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices can control your smart home, stream music, automate everyday tasks, and much more. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is much more than just a talking tablet. In fact, like Siri on your iPhone, Alexa can do way more than you probably realize. Playing your go-to Spotify playlist or checking the weather forecast is just the tip of the iceberg. With simple voice commands, Alexa can control your Fire TV devices, streamline your daily routines, and turn your home into a fully automated smart haven. Want to try something with Alexa? You probably can -- you just need to know the right words to say. If you have an Echo at home and want to get the most out of Alexa, here are all the voice commands you should try. Alexa is set to get an AI overhaul. We saw Amazon demo its new AI-backed commands back in 2023, but the rollout of this big AI update has been pushed. There are several Reddit threads like this one, discussing how the "Let's chat" AI command isn't properly available yet, so all we can do right now is wait it out. Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs. This story is periodically updated.

Title: These 4 Dow Jones Industrial Stocks Are Now In Down Trends

Full Content:
Dow Jones Industrials The weakness displayed on the price charts of these major, large capitalization Dow Jones Industrials is not a good sign for stock markets as a whole. Coming after a strong 2024, it’s an adjustment for Wall Street analysts to see how poorly these big names are performing just two months into the new year. These former leaders are having trouble finding the upside again. By downtrend, I mean that the price of each seems unable to power back up to or above the late 2024 high. That’s the first bit of price chart analysis, but there’s more. These stocks have dropped below the significant moving averages where it’s easy to make out the direction of trend, near-term and longer term. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) Caterpillar daily price chart, 2 24 25. The November 204 high is near $415. The January high of near $410 meets selling and goes no higher. You can see how the 50-day moving average (the blue line) began to trend downward by mid-December 2024. It looks as if it may cross below the 200-day moving average next or in a few weeks, a sign of further weakness. That the price is below both of the moving averages is not a bullish look and that it’s dropped below the early January low of just under $350 reinforces that. A test of the September 2024 low near $325 may be next. United Healthcare (NYSE: UNH) UnitedHealth Group daily price chart, 2 24 25. The stock peaked in early November at almost $630. The re-test in early December made it up to just $620, a failure to establish a new high. After the long drop to the mid-December low, UnitedHealth could climb no higher than $555 before the selling began again.

The big cap name is unable to make it back above the early July 2024 high. The attempt to do so in December 2024 fails. The 50-day moving average has turned downward and appears about to cross below the 200-day moving average, signaling the intensity of the weakness. Note that the price has dropped below the previous support levels of the early November 2024 low and is testing the low from early September 2024. If a more serious bout of selling begins, the August 2024 low near $380 may be tested. Merck (NYSE: MRK) Merck daily price chart, 2 24 25. Although the stock has rallied over the last few days, the price has along way to go to look bullish again. The 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average in early September 2024 and has remained below it since then. The early February 2025 gap down took Merck below the mid-November low. If this month’s gap is filled, the stock would climb above the 50-day moving average.

In the race to develop satellite services, AT&T and Verizon are both hailing recent tests that show they can power video calls on US phones using next-gen satellites from AST SpaceMobile. The video calls tap into AST’s BlueBird satellites, which the Texas-based startup launched into space back in September. The five satellites have since been orbiting Earth, with the goal of operating as cell towers in space that can connect unmodified phones on the ground. Although AST is still working for approval from the US Federal Communications Commission to operate the satellites commercially, the company did receive clearance last month to test the BlueBird constellation with both AT&T and Verizon — two of the startup’s major investors. In AT&T’s case, the carrier used a BlueBird satellite to power a video call from a phone in Midland, Texas, to another device in Dallas, while harnessing the carrier’s radio spectrum. Meanwhile, Verizon was able to do the same, but through the BlueBird 2 satellite; one phone was connected via satellite and the other was using Verizon’s terrestrial network connection. The carriers didn’t offer details, such as the quality of the video call or the connection speeds. But AT&T has uploaded a short clip, showing what the video call looked like. As you can see, the video quality is a bit grainy, but the call is successfully carried out. The results are also similar to the video call test Vodafone conducted in the UK last month, which also used AST's satellites. Competitor T-Mobile is aggressively trying to build interest in its own satellite-to-phone service through SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system, which currently supports text messages. Earlier this month, T-Mobile opened the beta program to test cellular Starlink connectivity for all US users, including those on AT&T and Verizon’s networks. In July, the company plans to start charging $15 per month per line for T-Mobile subscribers and $20 per month per line for all other users. Hence, consumers can expect a heated rivalry as AT&T and Verizon tout their own advancements in satellite-to-phone services, which aim to end cellular dead zones. In AST's case, the startup has designed its extremely large satellites to power voice calls and video and data downloads with speeds reaching over 20Mbps. The problem is that AST SpaceMobile only has five satellites in orbit, in contrast to SpaceX’s cellular Starlink constellation, which spans close to 500 and will one day support voice and video calls. AST will need several months or even a year before it launches the needed 45 to 60 BlueBird satellites to offer continuous coverage over the US.

February 24, 2025 12:22 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=131248&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study.

Title: Apple says it will spend $500 billion in US over next four years as it faces down Trump tariffs

Spending is said to include over 20,000 new American workers and the production of servers in Texas. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple today announced a plan to spend $500 billion in the United States in the next four years, including in jobs, suppliers, and building servers. This comes as Apple — like most consumer electronics companies — faces down a threat of tariffs from importing goods and components from China and other countries from President Donald Trump.The company says this is its biggest US-focused spending plan to date. Beyond jobs, it includes paying US-based suppliers, including factories owned by Texas Instruments and TSMC. Apple will build servers for Apple Intelligence at a facility in Houston, and claims it will increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and establish an "academy" in Michigan to "train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering." Following a meeting between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, Trump said that Cook was ceasing plants in Mexico and would increase its spend in the US. “They don’t want to be in the tariffs,” he told U.S. state governors. It's unclear which Mexican facilities Trump was referring to, though Apple supplier Foxconn has some plants there, Bloomberg points out.The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on goods imported from China and has mentioned, but not yet enacted, a 25% tariff on chips.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018 during the first Trump administration, including jobs and a campus in Austin, Texas. It's unclear which, if any, of the investments discussed recently were previously planned prior to Trump entering office for his second term. During the first term, Trump took credit for Apple's Mac Pro plant run by a contractor, which was already in operation.In 2021, Apple announced more U.S.-based spending plans, including a $430 billion investment including a North Carolina campus, as well as jobs in silicon engineering and research and development. (That campus is currently on pause)."We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a press release. Notably, the hiring commitments come at a time when much of big tech is going through layoffs.Cook's plans for US investments helped Apple during Trump's first terms, earning it exceptions from some tariffs on its biggest devices, including the iPhone. This time around, it appears other tech executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman and former CEO Jeff Bezos, are trying to follow Cook's playbook by cultivating relationships with the president.

Title: ‘They got to get rid of it somehow’: Shopper buys 24-pack of Sprite from Walmart. Then they open up the cans

Stace Fernandez This Walmart shopper found something really strange in her Sprite cans. Now, viewers are starting to speculate. Sprite, known for its iconic lemon-lime flavor, is known to be a clear drink, unlike sodas like Dr.Pepper and Coca-Cola, which are brown, and even ginger ale, which has a slight yellow tinge. That’s why this woman was so freaked out once she started pouring the soda she just bought. In a trending TikTok, Walmart shopper Meagan McGee (@themeaganmcgee) shared the offputting thing she found when she went to open a Sprite. The clip garnered more than 200,000 views total, as it was posted twice. See, her husband just went to Walmart and picked up a 24-pack of Sprite. But when McGee opened one, the liquid inside was a dark brown. Maybe it was a fluke with just one soda being accidentally filled? That doesn’t seem to be the case. McGee had already poured out two cans, and the third had the same contents. “Every single one of these is pouring out Coke. Make it make sense,” McGee says. Now, the most logical explanation is that Coca-Cola and Sprite are owned by the same parent company. A big mistake may have been made during the packing process, and Sprite cans were incorrectly filled. But commenters have their own, potentially less plausible, theories. “I wonder to make up for the difference in sales coke cola is being sold as other products just a hunch,” a person said, referring to the Coke boycotts. “Thanks but i like my soda companies with no ICE,” another added, also in refence to the boycott. “I did some quality work in that industry and there is a way to track back to the technician who signed off for that particular can,” a commenter claimed. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Coca-Cola did donate to Trump. The soda brand was added to this boycott list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. The Daily Dot reached out to McGee for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Coca-Cola via email. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: A Costco executive on the luxury items its wealthy customers love

Costco (COST-0.57%) is best known for its no-frills, bulk-buying experience, but the warehouse giant also moves a surprising amount of luxury goods. From Rolex watches to gold bars, high-end items have become an integral part of the business, and according to Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, wealthier shoppers are hooked. “We’ve known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great,” James said in an interview with Chief Executive magazine. That’s partly why the retail giant sells everything from Dom Perignon to 10-karat diamonds. According to James, Costco’s members are not just average-income households – they also include wealthier shoppers who recognize a good deal when they see one, like a Porsche on the sales floor of a Costco in Seattle. Costco, known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, won’t sell just anything. Unlike rivals Amazon (AMZN+1.97%) and Walmart (WMT+0.04%), Costco is selective about what it sells. While big-box retailers like Walmart stock over 120,000 different items, Costco limits its selection to about 3,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs). “We’re not interested in selling just anything at a low price,” James said. Instead of offering a $500 TV for $250, Costco would rather sell a $1,000 TV for $500. This formula has been a massive profit boost, further buoyed by the recent surge in gold bar sales. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.81%) noted last year in a research report that the company moved between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold bars each month. James told the magazine he wasn’t sure whether affluent shoppers or those wary of the economy were driving gold bar demand, but either way, the strategy has set Costco apart. He expressed confidence in the company’s position against Amazon and Walmart, noting that Costco focuses on its own approach rather than its competitors’ moves. Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, however, dethroned Costco to claim the top spot in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) 2024 rankings for general merchandise retailers. Another area where Costco continues to be an outlier is in its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). While many corporations, such as Walmart, McDonald’s (MCD-1.13%), and Target (TGT-1.92%), have scaled back on their DEI plans, Costco has held firm.

Title: Florida Sues Target Over Trans Merchandise

First Amendment Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 2.24.2025 10:00 AM Florida is suing Target for selling LGBTQ-friendly merchandise, something the state is misleadingly calling "efforts to sexualize children." You're probably thinking: Wait, doesn't the First Amendment stop the government from doing things like this? Doesn't Target have a First Amendment right to sell goods broadcasting whatever perfectly legal messages it chooses, and don't individual Americans have a First Amendment right to access those messages? The answer is a resounding: of course. But Florida authorities don't seem to care, so long as they get to perform concern for children. You are reading Sex & Tech, the newsletter from Elizabeth Nolan Brown on sex, technology, bodily autonomy, law, and online culture. Want more on sex, technology, and the law? Subscribe to Sex & Tech. It's free and you can unsubscribe any time. Δ What the state considers the "sexualization of children" seems to be anything discussing gender identity or acknowledging that transgender people exist. On X, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier listed three of the products that he objects to: "rainbow sports bras for boys," swimsuits for transgender children, and books about gender identity. Like many anti-trans crusaders, Uthmeier doesn't bother elaborating on how products concerned with gender identity—whether someone identifies as male or female or neither or both—are related to sexualization. He expects his audience to take it as a given that anything related to transgender or nonbinary identities is rooted in (deviant) sexuality. As has been pointed out many times before: In cases like this, it's the anti-trans crowd who are sexualizing children, applying their adult interpretations of gender and sex to things that are not inherently sexual. A girl saying she feels like a boy is not automatically expressing anything related to sexual feelings or preferences, nor is a teenager who likes to wear elements of masculine and feminine clothing necessarily making a sexual statement. Likewise, catering to a market of transgender and nonbinary minors is not an attempt to sexualize them. And Florida isn't only objecting to products designed for children. On the first page of its massive 163-page class action complaint, the state complains about Target having sold "transgender 'tuck-friendly' women's swimsuits with 'extra crotch coverage.'" Ari Cohn, who serves as lead counsel for tech policy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has called Florida's lawsuit "asinine, performative buffoonery and an attack on the First Amendment." The state, he noted, is objecting to products "based on the messages they convey—all of which are First Amendment–protected, and none of which 'sexualize children.'" You do have to give it to Florida authorities for creativity. Presumably aware that the state can't simply ban messages it finds distasteful, the state is trying to frame this not as a matter of censorship but as a matter of Target's corporate duty to shareholders. "Target's efforts to sexualize children caused its stock price to plummet, harming Florida's retirement fund and putting the retirements of our teachers and first responders at risk," Uthmeier said in his X post. Uthmeier accused the company of "misleading shareholders" and promoting "a harmful leftist agenda at the expense of shareholder returns." By this argument, the state could engage in all sorts of censorship so long as it bought shares in whatever companies it wanted to bully into cracking down on speech. It could even demand the suppression of certain messages on social media on in search results by buying shares in companies like Meta and Alphabet. "It's beyond question" that the products Uthmeier objects to Target having sold are "expressive items" protected by the First Amendment, noted Cohn. "That Florida's retirement fund holds shares of Target is irrelevant and meaningless. Government does not gain the power to regulate speech because it's a shareholder." If Florida thinks Target stock is a bad investment, it can divest itself of Target shares. It cannot use them as an excuse to say what sorts of perfectly legal messages the company may broadcast. Even if Florida could somehow sweep First Amendment issues aside, the state might not have much of a case. The new lawsuit, filed in federal court, "is one of at least three similar cases against Target in Florida," reports the Tallahassee Democrat. It claims that Target CEO Brian Cornell and the company's board of directors violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to "oversee or disclose the obvious risks of Target's 2023 LGBT-Pride Campaign" and thus "deceived Target investors." In a previous Florida lawsuit against Target, the company disputed some similar claims. The company "repeatedly warned investors of the risk" that consumers might boycott over its initiatives, it said in a January 2024 filing in this case. Florida might be unhappy with "Target's business judgment about merchandising. But disagreeing with Target's business judgment does not give rise to an actionable claim under the securities laws." • Surrogacy is the new battlefield in reproductive freedom. • "Presenting people with more partisan video recommendations has no detectable polarizing effects on users' attitudes in the short term," according to a new study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "While we cannot rule out effects from long-term exposure or to small vulnerable subsets of users, our evidence is not consistent with prevailing popular narratives about YouTube recommendation systems radicalizing users en masse." • A new bill in Alabama would allow pregnant women to defer jail or prison sentences. "The woman would then serve a term of pre-incarceration probation under electronic supervision until 12 weeks after she gives birth," reports the Alabama Political Reporter. "That probation period would then be credited to the woman's sentence." • After Texas banned abortion in 2021, "the rate of sepsis shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester," reports ProPublica.

Title: Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer is betting on the human touch — and AI

AI tools are here to stay, Moyer says, but Vimeo wants to build on ‘authenticity.’ by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. AI tools are here to stay, Moyer says, but Vimeo wants to build on ‘authenticity.’ by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. You probably know Vimeo from its beginnings as an artsier, more creative competitor to YouTube. But over the last few years, and especially after it went public in 2021, Vimeo has really turned itself into an enterprise software company, selling video hosting services to companies of all sizes. And this episode is a particularly fun full-circle Decoder moment — I interviewed Philip’s predecessor, Anjali Sud, both when she was the CEO of Vimeo and again more recently in her new gig as CEO of Tubi. So it was fascinating to close the loop and see how Philip is changing Vimeo after taking over, especially as the entire ecosystem of online video is shifting so rapidly. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Philip is pushing to make Vimeo a different kind of YouTube competitor, one that can support everything from independent creators to huge corporations. It’s a shift from the strategy Anjali used to reset the company and take it public, and there’s a lot of interesting nuance to it. Everyone wants to put videos on the internet, it turns out, but only some of those people want them to be ingested by YouTube’s advertising and recommendation systems. Philip himself has a ton of big tech experience: he’s worked at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and he’s deep in the weeds on both the tech and the business. You’ll hear us talk about Google’s business and YouTube in particular quite a bit in this one, but we also get into TikTok and what it means to have the incentives of algorithmic video platforms drastically influence both creators worldwide and the culture we all consume. Of course, we talked about AI, too, and how it’s upending every platform in different ways. Vimeo has been marketing itself as an “AI-powered video platform” lately, so I wanted to know what Philip is thinking about Vimeo’s creator-focused mission colliding with the pitfalls of AI-generated video. We also spent some time on the simple supply-and-demand math problem that seems like it will change the creator economy drastically in the years to come: that is, if the amount of video on the internet explodes because of AI while the total amount of time we can spend watching video remains relatively fixed, how is anyone going to make any money at all? This is a fun one; I think you can really tell that Philip and I could have kept talking for a very long time. Okay, Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Philip Moyer, you are the CEO of Vimeo. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. It’s great to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. I have got to tell you, just structurally, this is one of the very first truly full-circle Decoder episodes. Because we had your predecessor Anjali on as CEO of Vimeo, and then we had her on in her new job as CEO of Tubi, and now we have you on as her replacement. Wow, it’s full circle. It’s full circle for a show that’s about structure, decision-making, and organizational culture — this is as good as it gets for me. So thank you so much for joining us. That’s fantastic. I have a lot of respect for Anjali and have to say a big thank you to her for all she built here, so it’s wonderful to hear. I’m very curious. Anjali was in the middle of executing a big pivot when we talked about Vimeo. People know Vimeo as what it started as — a consumer video service, kind of the art-ier competitor to YouTube. She pivoted it to a [software-as-a-service] business. She was very open: “This is now a SaaS company, we’re doing a lot of enterprise work, we’re a video hosting provider to a lot of people, we are a video creation tool for small businesses.” That was several years ago. I talked to her three years ago at Vimeo. You’re the new CEO. What do you think of Vimeo today? I think in a lot of ways, I mean a little bit of what she started, and a lot of what we’re continuing here, is going back to the roots of what Vimeo is known for. People came to us because, at the time, 20 years ago, it was hard to upload video. I kind of call that… I’ll say the second or third epoch of video was right around that time period when video files were getting bigger. It was hard to stream video. They were no longer just a single file. We were starting to get multiple formats. People came to us because of the quality of our transcoding and then, ultimately, our ability to be able to serve it directly to the person that was most important that they wanted to provide that video. And a lot of what we’re doing right now, and what we’ve taken that Anjali had started and extended pretty significantly is… It turns out that lots and lots of organizations and individuals around the world want to be able to keep a video private or they want to be able to serve it only to an intended audience. They don’t want to have someone collect data, they don’t want to have an algorithm that tries to send them down a rabbit hole. Instead, they want to just literally be able to provide that video. And so we’re seeing that video makes up about 82 percent of the world’s internet today and we’re seeing that same concept arrive with private individuals, doctors, educators, and large organizations. And so yes, I would say that what we’re really becoming now is… Our goal is to become the largest private video distribution platform in the world. We think that there’s an increasing demand for video that isn’t public or algorithm-driven, but instead, it could be very personal and delivered at the right moment, at the right time, to the right individual. Let me try to just understand that in context. There was the beginning of [shared video], right? You’re saying there are several epochs of [online] video. There’s the beginning, which was on iOS as a “send to YouTube” button at the operating system level because no one thought that public videos were a big deal. You just needed someplace to watch videos and YouTube was that. And then YouTube grew into the social media juggernaut it is now. TikTok exists, all that’s there, and the initial reaction was that it’s very hard to compete with that. “We’ll be for enterprises, business customers have video needs, we’ll service them.” Are you saying there’s some kind of middle ground, in the middle of the spectrum between big algorithmic consumer video platforms and enterprise, where just a lot of regular people want private video sharing? We have hundreds of thousands of school districts that use us. Teachers want students to be able to upload video assignments. Especially in a world of ChatGPT and AI, teachers want to see that the student is actually doing the assignment. We’ve got tens of thousands of medical professionals who want to be able to send a video to a patient without having some algorithm capture their disease state or the question that they have. We’ve got lots and lots of marketing organizations that want to be able to serve their video over to an individual inside of a big company, or to their client, and they don’t want it to be public. And then what we’re also finding is, on the YouTube front, organizations that were hosting entire YouTube sections on their website… YouTube is redirecting its customers over to some other place. I was meeting with a really large financial services company’s CEO and the chief economist. I took them to the website and I said, “Let me show you your chief economist speaking.” I clicked on the video, and before the video played, we had to watch some advertising on some Bitcoin or something. And on the right-hand side, it said, “Here’s how the top three credit rating organizations are trying to control the world. This is the video you should watch next.” And we’re just trying to watch the economist’s video. So organizations are getting tired of being redirected or having their data captured. A lot of organizations are starting to bypass what I call the big walled gardens, and in a lot of ways we’re back in the MSN and AOL era for websites. That’s where we are with video right now and people want to be able to go directly to their consumers. They want to be able to serve the message in an unfettered way, and then ultimately, they just want to be able to ensure the highest quality and the most personalized experience. We’re seeing tremendous demand for those kinds of scenarios. Again, it’s everything from the school teacher, the fitness instructor, and in some cases, the faith institution, all the way up to some of the biggest companies in the world — and I do mean that literally the biggest companies in the world are becoming customers. I think the thing that I’m keying on there is… there’s the consumer-facing video platforms and then you have a bunch of enterprise video needs and you’re in some way describing a bunch of core enterprise customers, right? Large school districts, and companies big enough to have a chief economist. I think those are classic enterprise customers and then somewhere in the middle, those companies actually want to reach consumers without participating in algorithmic media, and that consumer surface is what Vimeo has gotten away from. Are you saying you’re pushing back towards it? We get about 100 billion views of video a year on Vimeo, and only 20 percent of it is on Vimeo.com. We show up on e-commerce platforms. I was meeting with a physician, who is an independent practitioner, a fertility doctor, and he records a video before his patients come in and he sends that video over to his patients in the fertility clinic. So we have individual proprietors, people who want to be able to share a family video or something that they learned if they had been at a doctor’s visit or otherwise — so we have lots and lots of people that are using [the platform as] individuals. Now on the filmmaker side… What is most amazing to me right now is the sheer number of filmmakers that I have coming to me, and this has really started kicking up since I’ve become CEO. I would tell you it’s been a trend for about the past six months. I have so many filmmakers that are coming to me saying, “We don’t like the deal… We don’t like the deal that we have with the big studios. We don’t like the fact that if we go to YouTube, as an example, they take 45 cents of every advertising dollar. Or if we want to go onto one of the big platforms, they’ll take as much as 50 cents of every dollar. Is there a way for me to be able to sell tickets to my audience?” In some cases, some of these filmmakers that come to us have audiences that are bigger than they might get on one of those platforms and so we’re finding people who want to go direct. Our streaming business is like that. When you post on some of these big platforms… I really encourage people to look at the terms of service of the major consumer-based video platforms. It says in their terms of service that they’re able to monetize your content any way they want to. They can reuse your content, they can serve the content, and quite frankly, they’re capturing 45 cents of every dollar in that process. So a lot of these organizations want to be able to bypass those kinds of economics. So is that you building a consumer interface? You’re saying it’s only a small percentage that’s coming to Vimeo.com. Where are they finding an audience? Is it all on their own websites? Is it on other people’s platforms? Where is that audience actually going? It’s been interesting because there is this trend among streamers in particular where they’ll go to the large platforms, they’ll get some following, and then when they want to be able to serve premium content. That’s when they’ll come over and say, “We want to put SVOD. We want to be able to put a gate in front of this content.” Or they may want to go live, they may want to go asynchronously, and so they’ll come to us and say, “Look, we want to be able to have a common library so that people can see past live events.” Plus, they want to be able to serve new content. In some cases, we’re getting organizations that want to do more interactive content — so like clickable videos, as an example. It’s a whole variety of creators that are saying, “Look, we might not want to adhere to the… let’s call it compliance requirements, the economic requirements, or the IP requirements of the big platforms. Give us an environment that we can control ourselves.” And that environment lives on their websites? Exactly. Sidemen is a great example of a group. They have one of the biggest followerships in the UK. They sold out Wembley Stadium in two hours and they famously played a soccer match where, when a yellow card was shown, one of the Sidemen held up an Uno reverse e-card to the ref and it blew up the internet over in the UK. They serve on Vimeo. They have both content that they put on YouTube or they put on Instagram, but then some of the more extended content they actually put on Vimeo, and then that library lives on us as well for a lot of things. Dropout’s is another great example of that. Try Guys is a great example of that. Zeus Networks, Martha Stewart — where they want a little bit more control over the content and they want control over the monetization more so than what the traditional platforms give you. I’m going to ask you a question, and you’re just going to have to bear with me on the mathematical nature of this question. Hopefully, it makes sense. I have a lot of CEOs of web hosting companies on the show because I’m very curious about the web in the age of platforms and where the audience comes from. The last great referrer of web traffic is, as everyone knows, Google Search; Google Search is undergoing some sort of gigantic AI-powered identity crisis. Who knows what’s going over there, but it’s changing. So I have the CEO of Squarespace or the CEO of Wix, or whatever other hosting providers, and I say, “Why does anyone build a website? Why would you do that instead of starting a TikTok channel now?” And they all say, “Well, it’s to do e-commerce, right?” Embedded in that is some sense that, “Okay, you’ve built a following on some platform, now you want to sell something to your audience. And you have to sell the spoons somewhere, so you’re going to start Spoons.com and that’s going to be hosted on Squarespace, and that’s the way it goes.” You’re describing the content itself as being valuable, and being more valuable when it’s hosted on Vimeo. Maybe you’re selling it, maybe you’re doing subscriptions, whatever you’re doing. But that’s happening on a website because you can’t transact that way on YouTube or TikTok. You can’t make the content valuable, but you’re still stuck with how you get the audience to come to the website that’s still just some fraction of a search audience or some fraction of conversions from one of the social video platforms. And that — this is the math — seems like the upper bound of your growth. Because some number of people have to come to the website, some number of people have to choose to transact on a video from the Try Guys, and that can only grow insofar as all of those individual customers can get people to come to the websites. Do you see that the web is the limiter in that way? No, not at all. I’ve worked for Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in my life. Most recently at Google, I worked in all manners of businesses and data problems, and I have this foundational philosophy that there’s actually more data behind firewalls and paywalls than there is in front. There’s more information behind those firewalls and paywalls than in front. And when I take a look at the enterprise market for video… In the past, you’d have a marketing video and it was hard, or you might have a couple of product videos for e-commerce. Or you might have, for example, the CEO’s message. Video is coming to literally every single element of business. In the same way that it’s 82 percent of the internet, it’s coming in [to business]. And so whether or not it’s that e-newsletter, whether or not it’s for sales… You look at an organization like Seismic or Gong, that records sales calls, and then it helps to coach individuals. If you watch a video, you’re 67 percent more likely to buy a product. And so we’ve got very large e-commerce customers where they now have millions of videos on us that are serving to every single product page on their website. So what I’m seeing is quite frankly that there is an explosion of video. It’s such an engaging medium. When you watch a video, you have 91 percent better retention than when you read something. A lot of the stuff that’s behind the firewall and behind the paywall is now getting video enabled, and it’s going across every single division inside of an organization, and it actually dwarfs what I’ll call a lot of the content. We’re going to see video show up in so many different ways and in so many different businesses. People are starting to use video to be able to determine efficiencies inside quick-service restaurants. They’re starting to use video to be able to evaluate what’s on a shelf and whether or not there’s a stock on the shelf. So when I think about this, I don’t think about it just in terms of one segment of our organization. Actually, the beauty of Vimeo is that we’re able to live inside and outside the firewall, and YouTube does not live inside the firewall. We’re able to hook in and sign a [business associate agreement] to do HIPAA for a doctor. YouTube’s not going to do that. You think about all the interactions in the healthcare industry that actually can be video-enabled… And so our upper bound of growth is a larger opportunity than what YouTube is focused on right now. YouTube, right now, is focused on video podcasts. They picked their shot and they’re going to take it. By the way, every time anyone says that stat about video retention, I feel like a dinosaur because I need to read. For as much video podcasting as I literally do, I am a reader. I’m an underliner. I have to underline things. I learned to highlight with five colors in law school. It’s still where I’m at. Maybe the future is video and that’s why we do a video podcast, but I’m still a reader to my core. There are three parts of the video business. We’ve talked a lot about distribution, and where you might distribute that video. It sounds like that’s where you think there’s a lot of growth across organizations, even to consumer in some new way. Then there’s monetization, which I want to go to, but the first part is the hardest and I think undergoing the most change in terms of what we expect videos to be, and that’s obviously creation. You need to make a video, you need to distribute it, you need to monetize it. The creation of video right now is super interesting because you have not just the young generation, but everybody learning to speak the language of TikTok. TikTok, I think, is most importantly expressed to people as a video editor, not just a scrolling video tool, and it’s a very powerful video editor that you can also use in CapCut. Then there’s AI, which is making it a lot easier to make all kinds of videos in all kinds of ways, and then there’s the smaller AI components, like it’s going to write a script for you that you can read and maybe that’s good. Maybe that’s bad, but it’s all just in the mix. Everyone is expecting the tools to guide them. You can see in particular how TikTok tools, challenges, filters, and templates create a kind of culture that builds upon itself. Are you thinking of that component of it? Like “We need to build an enterprise TikTok editor for people just to bring them into the pipeline?” I think there are a couple of dynamics that are happening right now. This is what gets me so excited about this… One of the biggest things that brought me here is that the barriers to video creation are dropping so dramatically, which leads to that mass proliferation of video, and then the difficulty in being able to manage at that scale. That’s just, foundationally, the market forces that are behind us. I always pause for a second and tell people, “I’ll be able to talk to you for a long time about artificial intelligence in a couple of seconds, but let me talk to you about what’s happening in video formats.” You’re one hundred percent right. Right now, we’re in that era when mobile video is becoming much easier. People are becoming more comfortable. Covid really helped us get comfortable with dogs barking in the background, babies being inserted into frames, and basically, I’ll just call it more casualness, in video. Before it was highly scripted, if you recall. Highly scripted. And so culturally, people are getting much more comfortable shooting video. The proliferation of tools has been extraordinary. Now, we did make some acquisitions in the past. Magisto was an example of this because we really felt that we had to make it easier and easier to be able to create video. Well, I was thrilled with the proliferation of tools. We shot a video for our Reframe conference. I shouldn’t say shot a video — we actually created a video using 16 AI tools that didn’t exist 18 months ago. Over $15 billion of venture capital has gone into creating those tools and that’s just one small set. But you’re absolutely right… You’ve got all these tools that are being created and so we are thrilled about that, but simultaneously, the format of video is also proliferating, and so you’ve got traditional like 1068, and you’ve got 4K that’s starting to become more commonplace. 8K is arriving. When you do 8K, it’s roughly about six times the size of a 4K video. Well, 16K and 32K televisions are on the horizon right now. You’ve got wide stream formats, square formats for podcasting, rectangular formats, and then we just recently released Apple Vision Pro support to be able to stream on an Apple Vision Pro — which is 8K per eye, 36 frames per second. Simultaneously, while the tools are proliferating, the format types are also proliferating. So, your ability to both accept video from any format… In some cases, you accept something that’s an old, old format that you have to get improved, or it’s a super high quality, giant widescreen format that needs to be cut up for all the different areas that you’re going to serve that video. What I would tell you is that it’s becoming more complex for the creator to choose which tool to use and when, and then how to ensure that the right format gets served at the right moment. So the two simultaneous things that are happening in our business are creative tools and formats, and they are exponentially growing right now. They’re exponentially growing the amount of video that a creator has to deal with. What’s growing the fastest? It’s really interesting. As you can imagine, I think the square format is popping up a lot. We are seeing a lot of demand for 4K — 4K in live formats and in serving formats. I think people are starting to demand that format more, which is obviously for us… We have to move more bits, we have to store more bits, we’ve got to transcode more bits, and so I would tell you that’s probably the thing that we’re seeing spike the most in terms of consumption. The traditional mobile stuff is going to be there and it’s going to be constant. I think it’s almost growing at the speed of so-called mobile phones, but I’m actually surprised about how many people are coming to us asking us for 4K. Why do you think that is? I look at the broader industry and you see the big streamers are pushing everybody to 1080p with ads. That’s sort of the default for Max or Netflix, and then you have to pay extra for 4K. Are you seeing that demand in the same way they do, which is that people will pay extra for it? Or are you seeing that demand as this is now the understood industry norm? It may be the place that we sit in the industry. As I mentioned at the top of our talk, people have always come to us for quality. So it may just be that because we’ve been known for quality — we’ve been known for the quality of our transcoding, our stream, the service that we do — that people are not finding that kind of support elsewhere and coming to us for it. I think that people are experimenting with those formats. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the sheer number of people who have come to us since we launched the Apple Vision Pro. They are coming to us with really interesting film projects to do 8K per eye, stitching all the camera work together. You’ll see us talk a lot about this at SXSW, about what we think. I’m seeing some good excitement in those 8K formats as well, that’s all I’ll say, but it might just be the position that we sit in the industry. It’s so interesting to see the rest of the industry basically insist that consumers don’t care about 4K. You and I are talking two days before the Super Bowl. For all of Fox’s talk about 4K, they’re still producing that in 1080p and then upscaling it. It’s fascinating to see the consumer side of the market land at one standard quality level while you’re saying the enterprise side of the market — the more discerning part of the market — is now not only assuming that 4K will exist, but that you will support 8K per eye, 36 frames per second on the Vision Pro. And when there’s 16K for TVs out, I think people will be buying them. That’s a lot of cost, right? I mean you’re talking about moving an enormous amount of data. Are you just getting ahead of it because that’s what the customers expect? You have a background in cloud services and big data. Is that something where you say, “Okay, this is just scalable? We can solve this problem with the tools we have”? Or do you have to build new systems? It’s a little bit like… I’ll use the corollary of what’s going on with token size inside of AI models, where everybody knows that the very first version of ChatGPT was maybe, I don’t know, a hundred million tokens and then it popped over to a billion tokens and will be up to a trillion tokens. So the cost to be able to deliver all of that will come down over time. The cost of storage comes down, the cost of bandwidth comes down, and then even the innovations that are in the televisions, those costs will be coming down. When you think about the quality of the TVs we have now versus even just 10 years ago, it’s so discernibly different and I think that as those costs come down, somebody has to serve that content and our infrastructure... We have the infrastructure to be able to do it, and so for some of us, we have to stay slightly ahead so that we are that place that’s always viewed as quality. So yeah, I guess it has to be part of our DNA that we’re always going to support those cutting-edge formats. We’ve opened the door to AI and I definitely want to talk about that and in particular, using AI as a creative tool, and how your customers might be thinking about that and their relationship to it. But first, I just want to get to the Decoder questions. We’ve talked a lot about how you’re thinking about growing Vimeo’s business. What would you say is the most tangibly different thing you’re doing compared to your predecessor Anjali? There are a couple of things. I think Anjali was supporting a lot of different businesses. I’ll say as you went through covid and as you went through when video was hard… I would say it wasn’t as culturally ingrained as it is right now. She had to make a lot of decisions around the business. When I got here, a lot of people asked me this question: “Well, do we serve the consumer or do we serve the enterprise? Do we serve the filmmaker or do we serve the physician?” When I really spent time with who our customer was, I really had to get deep, deep, deep down inside and go, who really uses us? Show me the type of company, show me the names of the companies, and the industries that we’re in. It was very clear to me that we serve the creator who is professional, somebody who is using video for their business professionally. It’s not a hobby. It’s actually to get a job done. Being able to consensus around that creative pro, not trying to go and create a YouTube competitor or a low-cost tool for the hobbyist, but truly that we serve that professional creator, and then being able to describe very succinctly the fact that all of that comes together. Sometimes a professional creator wants to serve a single video. Sometimes they need to be able to manage thousands of videos. Sometimes they want to be able to go live, sometimes they need a high quality, and sometimes they need help to divide it, to cut it up into rectangular or square formats. I think one of the core things that I did when I got here was really obsess about the customer. Every meeting we start, we start by telling a customer’s story. I learned a lot of this, I would tell you, between Google and Amazon. Amazon is, I would say, renowned for this, but we really tell the stories of who our creators are and then really build the ability to move quickly and listen to those enterprise requirements. When you start a company, and… I started at Microsoft in the very early days of Microsoft. It wasn’t an enterprise company then, believe it or not. Amazon, when I got there, didn’t have a lot of financial services companies using the cloud. I went through that transition. At Google, it wasn’t really known as an enterprise-grade cloud when I first got there. So I’ve been through this transition, and when you start a product that is going to serve the enterprise, what I always tell people is that it’s easier to get more complex, but it’s really hard to be complex and get easier. And so we were starting from these roots as a consumer and filmmaker’s product, and a lot of what I’ve focused on is really listening quickly to not just our individual customers, but the entire spectrum, and being able to say yes to those requirements. I also come with a tremendous amount of experience as you can imagine. You could look at my background — it’s years of enterprise experience, and so, I know what’s required to be able to do HIPAA. I understand how to do General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I understand compliance requirements. When we go into things like artificial intelligence, or we go into storage and distribution, I have a lot of instincts around that. Spending the time to explain where we’re going as a company, to be able to serve both inside and outside the firewall, and the requirements that we’re going to have architecturally, and just explaining that to the organization and weaving together… Hey, that filmmaker wants their content protected the same way that the largest retailer in the world or the CEO wants their content protected, then weaving those two messages together and building a product roadmap that’s going to serve both. I feel like that’s probably the biggest thing that I’ve done since getting here: unifying the vision into a single cohesive vision. And then the second thing is really making sure that all of us are telling the stories. “Hey, did you know that this fertility clinic is using us in this way? Did you know that this school teacher is using us in this way? Did you know that this faith organization uses us in this way? Do you know that the largest retailer uses us this way?” Getting people to tell the stories internally, I think, was important. The last thing I’ll tell you is that there was a little bit of a shine that came off the company after the IPO. I think, giving the company confidence and saying, “Let me tell you who’s actually using us.” I don’t think that a lot of people really realized, internally even, the broad array of customers we have. I put this in our shareholder letter: we have eight out of the top eight big box retailers. We have eight out of the top eight media companies that are using us internally. We have huge numbers of insurance and financial services companies, companies that could use anybody, and I said they’re using us for a reason. So getting some confidence back into the company that we actually are an incredibly valuable tool in a world of increasing complexity — I think that gives the company a lot more confidence to be even bolder as we go forward. You’re talking a lot about culture change, and renewed focus. The thesis of this show is that that comes out of structure. I’m just looking at our notes here from my producers. In the past few months, you’ve named a new chief marketing officer, a new chief information security officer, a new people officer, and a new chief revenue officer. You’re obviously making some changes in the organization. How was Vimeo structured and how are you restructuring? I think that, in some cases, our technology organizations were incredibly siloed. How we did trust and safety as an example, in some cases how we did data, and who owned which parts of engineering. They were actually broken up in a lot of ways. I think oftentimes our marketing organization had one mandate while the sales organization might’ve had another mandate. A lot of what I would tell you was really important to me… One of my first hires was a chief technology and product officer, Bob Petrocelli. I brought in an individual who unifies product engineering and is able to have single-threaded leadership over top of parts of the business that are that important. They have to be working together well. Some of the things that we’re doing in trust and safety, we actually think we can turn around and expose that to our enterprise customers. It turns out they probably don’t want things on their platform the same way that we don’t want certain things on our platform. So getting any internal function to become an external function and getting that kind of view that we all serve the customer in some way, shape, or form is super important inside of our product and technology organizations. One of the most important things I had to do was bring in our Chief Marketing Officer, Charlie Ungashick, who has really extensive experience marketing to individuals and enterprise. We are going out and talking about how we can protect videos, serve videos, and provide AI to that entire audience. So we had to get an individual who was able to oversee both parts of the business. I’ve also done some recent restructuring where we put an individual completely in charge of what we call our self-service business. To be able to move even faster in that part of the business and obsess on everything from the top of the funnel all the way through when a subscriber comes in, right down to “what are we actually using in the product”… And this is a big element as well. I will tell you one of the other changes I didn’t mention is that we’re obsessing on use right down to the feature level. I look at those reports on a weekly basis, like how many people are using our edit feature, and how many people are using our live feature. How many people applied permissions to a video? Did that increase week over week? What did we do? And so that self-service leader is really now a single-threaded leader, and we also had a single-threaded leader around our streaming business. We really started seeing some of the results from that inside the company. Giving single-threaded leadership, I will tell you it is talked about a lot, but oh my God, it’s beautiful to actually be able to call up somebody that owns the number, that owns the resources, that worries about it as much as you do every single day. Single-threaded leadership is an Amazon concept. You’ve worked at all the companies, so I can pick out where the concepts come from. It’s pretty fun for me. That’s a classic Amazon concept. It is. You need to have a pretty small team that owns the thing and there’s a leader who is responsible for the whole stack. That is how you get silos. You can look at Amazon’s product and say, “Oh, there’s a bunch of single-threaded leaders here.” This is not necessarily cohesive. Everything is running as fast as it can, but the holistic vision of the Amazon product suffers for it at scale, right? You started out talking about having too many silos and we’re talking about single-threaded leaders. How are you managing that tension? I was asked one time to give a talk on what it was like to work at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. I got an opportunity to work directly with Gates, Ballmer, Jassy, and then certainly with Thomas Curry and Sundar Pichai. One of the most important lessons I learned very early on at Microsoft was about really establishing a strong single-sentence vision for the entire company about what we’re trying to do in the future. And you wake up every single morning and I mean… I was there in the early days when the vision was a PC on every desktop in every home. That was extraordinary at the time. Now we have a PC in every pocket, but we all knew that what we were trying to do was unlock information for the world by putting this powerful computing device in someone’s hands. And so regardless of the divisions or otherwise, it all feathered into a common vision. It was a lot of what I had to do when I got here. I owed the company a strong agreement among everybody in the company about what we’re trying to build. Are we trying to build the best livestream product? Are we trying to build the best marketing platform? Are we trying to build a product for filmmakers? We settled on this common vision and then we’re able to say, “Okay, this is the individual that owns this part of the business.” There’s a huge portion of our individual business where people swipe a credit card and start using us or register for free. A huge number of those customers actually end up as enterprise customers. I called up one of the top retailers and started talking to him about Vimeo and he said, “Well, first of all,” he goes, “You don’t have to tell me who you are.” He goes, “My son is on Vimeo every weekend. He’s an independent filmmaker.” He goes, “So I know who you are, but why are you calling me?” And I said, “Well, we have 2,600 accounts, self-service accounts that are on [our platform]. We should do an enterprise agreement.” So being able to explain to the organization how the two sides work together and being able to make decisions in a room between where we’re applying more features may be in one part of the business or another… And how those features actually feather, how we might start them for an individual, but they have to grow to work for an entire enterprise — is all really, really important. Starting with a strong vision that everybody buys into, that they understand their piece of it, is really critical. And then for each one of those leaders, I expect them to have a strong vision for how they’re going to contribute to the overall vision. That’s another important thing. You can’t let their vision exist in the absence of the rest of the company’s vision, so you have to actively stitch those visions together. You brought up decisions. That’s the other classic Decoder question. I will warn you: this is a honeypot for former Amazon executives. When you ask Amazon executives how they make decisions, everybody sings chapter and verse, but you’ve worked at a bunch of places. You are now the CEO of this company. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? The other company I didn’t talk about that I learned a lot from was Google. One of the things that I would tell you Google gave me was that they managed something like 10 out of the top 11 billion-user products in the world and were really thinking big. Actually giving an organization incredibly lofty goals, and sometimes you only reach 80–90 percent of them. One of the things that I do first and foremost is — that I really am a believer in — that you’ve got to set these very high goals. You need to have this vision and you need to be willing to put yourself out there to set extremely high goals. And then back into that from a decision-making process, I would tell you that we’ve made a number of decisions around which products we focus on, which areas we deprecate. I come back to the customer. One of the things I really try to hold people accountable to, and I think it’s really important, I learned a lot of this both at Google and at Amazon, but actually explaining the customer problem that we’re trying to solve. And there are all kinds of studies that you can do. There are user studies, data studies, and so forth, but truly being able to assess what that workflow looks like. What are we trying to solve? What is the most challenging thing for the customer? What is actually frustrating the customer most? And really having a strong sense for your customer and the customer anecdotes as well as what we call... At Google, we called it customer empathy, actually putting yourself in the shoes of the customer. One of the things that we ask everyone inside of Vimeo to do is be a user of the product. So the things that are frustrating us, we are elevating those into our decision-making process. We both bring the voice of the customer in and, we bring our own voice in, and then we also are saying, “Okay, well what’s going to help us grow? What’s going to grow the next million users for us or what’s going to grow us to 10X?” So I can’t just tell you it’s one thing. It’s a little bit of a framework of the customer, making sure we’re tethered to big ideas and really making sure that we’re being innovative enough in how we push the team. Well, I applaud you for being the only former Amazon executive to not talk about one-way and two-way doors when I ask that. You’ve done it, you’ve achieved escape velocity. I mean, I appreciate the one-way and two-way doors. I’m just saying. No, I get it. I don’t know if I’d buy that. The thing I do love, I mean, at Google, I think they’ve proven that there’s not a lot of one-way doors. Fair enough. Google’s interesting. We’ve talked a lot about YouTube during this conversation. Vimeo has come out against YouTube. You have entire blog posts about how your search capabilities are better than YouTube’s search capabilities or how Vimeo is a better platform. You’ve talked, even in this episode, about wanting things to be private, not being part of the algorithmic ecosystem or the advertising ecosystem on YouTube. Google is big. They think so big that sometimes they let opportunities just slide away because they think at such a massive scale. How are you thinking about competing with YouTube at that scale when they seem to own so much of the attention, space, and video? I don’t think that a lot of product companies love the fact that you have to go to YouTube to get some customer support for one of their products. Meanwhile, one of their competitors could be rolling right next to you. And I think that when I look at YouTube… I was at Google and spent a lot of time with customers, and I really foundationally believe... I love YouTube, I’ll watch YouTube as much as the next person. I think that what they’re doing for, I’ll call it the attention economy, for what they’re doing around content, for democratizing access to more and more content — I think it’s absolutely wonderful. And quite frankly, as I said, a lot of our customers are great YouTube customers as well. People will house their videos on Vimeo and post on YouTube in a lot of ways. But I really do think that there is… In the same way that you don’t do a lot of your business on Facebook or you don’t do it on LinkedIn, you kind of do it behind closed walls. I think that a lot of the economy runs behind firewalls and paywalls. So I think that we can go directly at that. The other thing I’m going to say is… Think about what happened in content and why some of these platforms rose. Think about, and again, I’m old enough to remember MSN and AOL — the reason why we went there was because news had to be consolidated. It was hard to create websites. It was difficult to find information, it had to be curated. Well, Netflix and YouTube were born in an era where it was really hard to categorize content to say, “Hey, this video is about a cat,” or “This video is about how to plug an HDMI cord into the back of your LG TV.” And so there was categorization that had to take place. There was standardization of the data, the metadata, and then recommendations engines. I don’t know if you remember, but Netflix famously paid a million dollars to be able to write their recommendation engine. They went out and said, “Whoever builds the best recommendation engine will win a million dollars.” Well, with an AI model, I can categorize content in seconds now. With a recommendation engine, I can buy recommendation engines off the shelf. And quite frankly, the metadata that we can produce now out of a video is extraordinarily more detailed than a human being can even write. I can tell you precisely when the purse left the beach, who was carrying the purse, and what brand of shoes the individual was wearing. All stuff that may be missed when a human being has to enter all that metadata. And so what I see is that there is going to be a democratization of content classification, content recommendation, and context discoverability. I think that there are searches… There is a single search place that you go to be able to get your content, videos, and maps, and pick your favorite things. But I think that there are billions of dollars going into discovering other ways to find and interact with information. And so I think that Vimeo can serve that kind of information outside of a traditional Google search in a lot of ways, whether or not you’re on an intranet inside of a company, whether or not you’re inside an AI model and you don’t want to leave the ecosystem of the AI model. We can provide an answer to a question as well. I think YouTube is fantastic, I love it, but I think that for the discoverability, accessibility, indexing, and recommendations, there’s a whole new era coming and we intend to be a part of it. There’s another piece of that dynamic that I’m wondering if you are considering, which is that Google is a huge company that is under an enormous amount of pressure right now. Maybe it’s so much pressure that it will be hard for the company to execute. There’s an antitrust trial in this country that resulted in the government suggesting Google break itself up and sell Chrome. There’s Donald Trump in the mix, who may or may not make some sort of deal. There’s a Donald Trump in the mix who’s done a tariffs regime with China that resulted in a Chinese antitrust investigation of Google — which is amazing because Google doesn’t really operate in that country. Europe exists, much to the chagrin of many of our tech companies. There’s just a lot going on. There’s a lot of pressure on Google to not flex that dominance. And then there’s competitive pressure from the AI products, like ChatGPT, SearchGPT, and Bing — to whatever extent that Microsoft believes that Bing is a real competitor to Google. Does that create an opening for you? Do you see that as a real opening or is that just well, if those doors open, you’ll be ready? I have a lot of friends at Google. I really enjoyed my time there. I don’t wish them ill in any way, and I really hope that they sail through this era of challenge for them in a really great way. Clearly, I came here from Google because I saw the opportunity. I really did see the opportunity that… We’re about to go through a seismic shift in the accessibility of information with new ways to go and access it. Whether or not you’re using ChatGPT, Anthropic, or Mistral, there are so many different ways to be able to discover information. The notion of the common crawl on the web, the ability to be able to crawl the whole web, index it, and then to be able to ingest it into these models shows that it’s democratizing access to that information discovery. Video is a very important element of video, and I think you’d agree. You can’t just imagine only one platform is going to serve all the video answers in the world, and so that’s where I see it’s such a super opportunity for us at Vimeo. Let’s talk about AI. I want to start by asking a mathematical question. One of my theses for the year is that the creator economy is under an enormous amount of pressure. Not just from AI, but also from what you’re describing: this huge shift to video. You can see that there’s just an exponential increase in the supply of video on all these platforms. More and more kids are making videos. More and more people are choosing to communicate in video-first ways. More enterprises are doing it. And then you have AI, which is just making it easier and easier to produce a massive amount of video. So the platforms are getting flooded with supply. There’s not as much ad revenue as there is an increase in video supply, so you do the division and you’re like, well, the ad rates are going to go down, and then attention is sort of fixed. There are only so many people with so many hours in a day, and presumably, people do have to eat and do productive work. So attention is kind of fixed, right? It’s just like a fixed number that you can capture. That all just seems like it’s a bubble that’s going to pop. You flood an ecosystem that has been pretty stable for a few years with an enormous amount of supply, the ad rates go down, and attention stays fixed. Something happens in there, and it seems like, to me, AI is the most important component of that because it’s the thing that can change the economics of the supply the fastest. You just say, “Make 50 videos about my product,” and now we have 50 videos about the product on whatever platform. Is that an opportunity for you? That this whole creator economy, or the video creator economy as we know it, seems like it’s going to have a pretty basic shift in its economics? That’s a huge question. To me, it is the question of 2025 — if you asked me, “What is The Verge doing in 2025?” There’s Elon Musk and DOGE, and then there’s what happens to the creator economy. I think with the creator economy, we are reaching saturation. I mean, think of your own experience. I don’t know when we’re going to get to the post-mobile phone era, but this is not a way we’re going to live for the rest of eternity as human beings. And so on the creator’s side, yes, I think that there is a saturation point, but I also think that people are looking for a little bit of a higher quality experience. I think people are getting tired of the doom scrolling. I think the mere fact that we name it, the fact that we are now acknowledging that we get sent down rabbit holes... I do think people will like storytelling. And I do think there’s going to be really different opportunities. I get asked all the time, “When will AI be able to take my favorite book and turn it into a movie?” And now, think about that. Think about how wonderful that would be. Think about being able to take your child’s favorite book and turn it into a video for them that has an extended storyline. I think storytelling is as old as humanity and it’s going to continue forward and so I do — Can I just stop you there for one second? I know the Decoder audience fairly well. A lot of people just started screaming at you in their car because they think that’s a bad outcome. Do you think that’s a bad outcome? I have a young child. The idea that we’re going to read The Wild Robot and then some AI tool is going to make the movie The Wild Robot instead of the beautiful actual movie made by people, The Wild Robot — I would argue that that’s a bad outcome. I think it is for a class. Here’s what bugs me the most right now. Last year the big six studios only put out 88 movies. 88. Right, because the economics of video have collapsed on them. They don’t have a distribution monopoly. Exactly, and I think there are so many stories to be told. If the creator of The Wild Robot gets paid for having a movie and is able to be monetized in some shape or form, in a really beautiful way, I actually think we’re supporting storytellers in a foundational way. I think that that’s a decade away. I would say maybe five to seven years away. And so first and foremost, I do think that AI is going to help people create more stories. I think they are. I think they’re going to be able to illustrate more stories, let’s put it that way. I talk to a lot of creative types who tell me, “Look, AI is fairly disjointed right now. It’s indeterministic. I don’t know what I’m going to get out of it.” Human curation of AI creation is going to be a necessity, in the same way that shooting on a green screen and then being able to put in a background for a movie is indeterministic until the human being decides what’s on that green screen. What I’m saying is that I do think that longer-form stories are going to be more compelling. I think people are going to want to stay inside of a story a little bit longer. That doesn’t mean that the creator is going away. It doesn’t mean human curation is going away. I just think that we’re going to be able to tell more beautiful stories in more ways. So I’ll park there because we are pro-creator, we are pro-filmmaker, and we serve a lot of them. They’re not going away. We’re going to uplift them and make them faster. I think this is a real tension, and I see it expressed all the time. I’ve heard it from your peers on the show when they tell me about the tools that people use in Photoshop, right? Generative fill in Photoshop, according to Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, is like a hundred percent usage rate. But then, everyone yells about generative fill existing, and there’s a real mismatch between consumer expectations and how people feel about AI, and then about the creatives actually using the tools at high rates. I get all that. I also think there’s a mismatch between you saying you’re for filmmakers and how marketers want to use AI. I think we’re careening towards a world of basically custom creative being shown to individual users. [A world] where some brand uploads their assets to a video platform and ads get assembled for you in AI. For you, a specific user, [to get] ads targeted to your interests. We’re headed there and the big platform’s already talking about it. But those really commercial uses of AI — “we’re going to make a whole bunch of ads and we’re going to do some of the most creative filmmaking that exists” — they don’t seem like they’re happening at the same rate or with the same level of acceptance, or even like they should happen with the same tools, and you have every piece of the puzzle in front of you. Where do you see the biggest growth and where do you see the biggest pushback? One of our creators, Jake Oleson, recently shot Currents for Apple Vision Pro. And when you shoot for an Apple Vision Pro, you have to maintain perfect stillness in the camera. You’ll shoot four to six cameras and by hand, you have to stitch all these things together. If you get an opportunity to watch Currents, it’s absolutely stunning. You kind of look at it and go, “Oh my God, I’ve seen the future of filmmaking. I truly have.” And I do think that this is where I say that I think we’re going to get into a post-mobile phone era for watching content and creativity. And I think that we’ll experience film in new ways. We’ll experience stories in new ways. And I think that I’m seeing the best creators blend together the content and AI usage with traditional techniques to make something incredible. Most filmmakers that I talk to start with something they’ve shot and then enhance it with AI. One of the things that is most interesting to me is that, in the marketing world, the thing that’s taking off the most right now are not avatars (and avatars, I like to call them… like nobody wants to talk to a robot), it’s actually people that are sitting there going, “Hey, I just bought this piece of furniture. This looks really cool. Let me show you what it looks like inside of my house.” Actually, authenticity in a world of robots I think is actually... I’m already seeing it. We offered to a number of our customers, “Hey, would you like us to do some avatars?” And then we also offered to them, “Hey, we have this super down-and-dirty create tool where you can record, we can put a teleprompter up in front of you so you can do your own script. And we can either make the avatar look perfect or you can be sitting in your living room and do this quick thing about your product or about your service.” And inevitably, all of them go to the real human being doing this. I’m just going to tell you point blank: I’m not seeing the robots take off. I’m not seeing it. And we’ve tried to serve both. I think that humans have always risen above. They’ve always brought authenticity. They’ve always brought through how you kind of know when you’re getting something and when you’re not. Even in the chatbot world, how many people get frustrated when they’re talking to a chatbot online? They quickly want to talk to a human being. I don’t know how to say it to you, but we sense that there are no ghosts in the machine. So I don’t know how to say it to you any other way. I studied artificial intelligence for a long time and I’m very confident in the beauty of the human soul in the context of creativity. I feel like I’m more cynical than you, but I spend more time on social platforms, it feels like. And the problem, generally, is you can sense it. Some people can feel it, and a lot of people cannot, right? Or they just let it wash over them and then you end up in sort of interminable fights about metadata or labeling. Google just rolled out SynthID for images that you edit in Google Photos. None of that stuff seems to have landed. It has certainly not landed in a universal way. Vimeo has some labeling features. You have some ideas about how you might show people AI-generated content or expose that metadata to people. Do you think that’s working? Is that something you’re going to continue? Is that something that you think needs to be expanded? When I was at Google, there were about 42 different regulatory bodies that were working on AI legislation. The last we checked, there are over one thousand on a worldwide basis. And I’m raising that to say that when you do translations in certain states inside of the United States, like Illinois or Texas, you can’t actually modify people’s lips and put words in their mouths, so that’s just one of the regulations. Over in Europe, you actually do have to identify that something’s been AI-enhanced or modified. So I do think that we as humanity are wrestling with it when we want to know that something’s not real. The mere fact that that’s coming from all over the world, that you’re seeing the desire to know when something’s not real, I can’t say whether or not that’s good or bad, but I can tell you that it’s actually a human desire. And so, getting something done like changing the credit card on my telephone bill, I’ll deal with a bot to do that. But if I’m really having a problem, or my elderly father-in-law is having a problem, I actually do want a human being to pick up the phone and just talk him through it. I guess what I’d say to you is… I think in filmmaking as well, we’ve always used tools to tell our story. It’s been the invention of so many tools to help us tell stories. AI is just another tool to help us tell the stories. I would certainly like to know when characters aren’t real. I guess this is the hardest question. This is an existentially philosophical question, but: Where do you draw the line? Where do you personally think the line should be for when you have to put the label on something? I’ll give you two examples. I think when I stabilize a video with AI, that does not require it. I think if I’m talking to a deepfake avatar, or a creator that is photorealistic, that is just lying to me, that situation probably requires it, right? I’ve replaced products in this movie with other products and that may require it. Where do you think the line is? I think that I haven’t been asked this question before, but as I reflect on it, I would like to know that a particular character, animal, or something that’s in the film is actually not real — that it’s completely made up. Now you can tell that in animation, but in a real film, if I know that a certain character or a certain scene is actually completely fabricated with a single individual in it, I probably would like to know that. Or when there’s dialogue involved where something’s talking back to me that’s not for real, I probably want to know about it. When I look at some of the Marvel movies, clearly you start crossing the line. Well, does the fox in Guardians of the Galaxy do it? We all know the fox is- The latest Marvel movie they just announced is Fantastic Four, and they made the poster with AI, and there’s fan backlash to it. So I’m just wondering if you see the norms moving faster than the technology, or slower? You are shipping these products and you have such a direct line to creators, so it feels like you’re caught up right in the middle of where we put the labels. The thing that really does bother me right now is the influencers that don’t even exist. If I’m looking at something that’s clearly animated, I’m okay with it. I would love to know that somebody’s voice was actually used for real by that individual. So it’s going to be complex and I wonder out loud, will we stop caring, and at what point? Will we become comfortable that basically the whole thing is simply animated because that’s really what we’re talking about? We’re just creating animation that’s higher and higher fidelity in a lot of ways. But I think it should probably be noted that, at some point, the human doesn’t exist. I feel like that’s probably where I’d cross the line, or that dog doesn’t actually exist, especially if the dog’s a main character. So you might end up doing it based on the classification of the importance of the character and whether or not there’s actual, true existence there. And how much modification was done to the individual based on the class of character in the story? I asked that question three different ways and pushed on it again because it feels like the pressure on the creator economy and the social platforms is just going to go up. With Meta, Mark Zuckerberg is out there openly saying, “We will have AI content in people’s social feeds on Facebook and Instagram.” How they choose to label it, whether or not the mean dogs have labels — I don’t know. I don’t know what Mark Zuckerberg is going to do. No one can see into his soul, but it’s pretty obvious that if he could get a bunch more cute cat videos on Facebook using AI, he’s going to do it. It’s obvious why he would do that. Does that create an opportunity for you to say Vimeo is for real content or real people? Is that something you would lean into? Because you do have the AI tools. When you open the website today, it says you’re an AI-powered video platform. There’s a lot of conflation between “we can do better classification and with better recommendations” and “we can do better marketing videos and we’re going to steal everyone’s data and make cat videos for Facebook attention spans.” I think as I sit here and think about protecting the Vimeo brand, I aspire to actually be the place that people trust. When I first got here, we were approached to basically crawl our content and it was like as many companies were approached… We talked to the creators and the creators said, “Listen, don’t replace us. Just uplift us and protect us. Make sure that Vimeo is always a place where we’re protected and that’s why we come to you and that’s why we want to continue to come to you.” So we made a decision not to allow that crawling, and then shortly thereafter we had to say, “Anytime you use AI on Vimeo, we’re going to actually guarantee that none of the AI models will improve based on your usage of it.” Unless you say, “Improve based on my usage, like understanding my storyline, my filters, my dialogue, or my style of dialogue,” we’ll do that for you as an individual creator. We’ll create your own private AI. We were actually approached as well to say, “Listen, we need you.” A number of the creators said, “We want you to help us identify when content has been generated by AI.” We do a lot of business over in the EU, and so we said, “Yes, we’re going to do that as well.” The thing that I describe about AI… Back in the era of the production line, humans stopped being able to keep up in a lot of ways, and so we started creating robots. We started creating machines that turned on screws and so forth. And next year at this time, there’s going to be more information created in the next year than there has in the history of mankind coming up until this point. Humans are struggling to keep up with a production line of information. So we’ve invented these machines. I also think AI is going to help us identify these things. It will help us filter and help us be able to say, “This is AI generated,” or “This content cannot be verified from the source.” We have to do some work around what we call KYC or know your creator. In some jurisdictions that we operate in, we have to actually say, “Yes, this is a human being that created this, this is the company that created this.” I actually think we have an opportunity to serve as that — like “Yes, this was created by a real human,” which actually stands out in a world of robots. So I think there are a lot of opportunities to protect the viewer and the creator, as well as serve them in helping produce stories faster. I want to ask one more foundational question about AI. There’s a lot of talk about cost right now in the AI world. There’s DeepSeek, which might have brought down the cost of training. There’s an argument about whether the cost of inference will drop. At the same time, Sam Altman is saying he’s going to build $500 billion worth of data centers all around the world with SoftBank. You use these tools, right? You’re deploying these tools against some large data sets in video, which is where the costs tend to go up the fastest. Where do you think that is? Is that working out for you? Are you making more money on the use of AI than you’re spending on it right now? The short answer is yes. I would tell you that I expect the cost of inference to drop dramatically. We were experimenting with some of the exact same things that DeepSeek claimed to do, to be able to use really low-cost chips to be able to do inference. And I do expect inference… the cost of inference is going to go through the floor. I used to joke to say, “If I need to order a Frosty and a double burger at Wendy’s, I don’t need to wade through all of Taylor Swift’s boyfriends and songs to be able to get through that.” So distillations of models to be able to serve at the exact moment of time that’s necessary, whatever the language or the function is. I think that you’re going to see that distillation will help us with this. The most recent Blackwell chips from Nvidia were about four times more efficient. Lighter weight models are super important to us. So we’re going to solve a lot of the inference problems and the cost associated with inference. I’m seeing it drop dramatically for what we do, and so it’ll be very manageable over time. I think that the real big cost for a lot of these companies is the training of some of this stuff, and that is going to come in line as well. We’ll get to a point of diminishing returns, like do you really need to go to 10 trillion-parameter models, or do you need something that’s just lighter weight to be able to do chemistry, biology, security, or coloration, as an example? I think, right now, we’re in the era of big models, and I don’t think that’ll last. Do you think we need to spend $500 billion on data centers all around the world? We need to lay down a new infrastructure of silicon. The silicon that’s around the world right now is highly optimized for general compute, and this is a new mathematical model that has to be supported with silicon. Otherwise, we’d actually consume more power if we didn’t have specialized chips that run this math equation. So all that’s happening right now is that, yes, we need to run our current compute and now we have a new algorithm we have to run. We’re going to need optimized silicon to be able to run that extra algorithm. So the short answer is that we actually do have to duplicate the silicon around the world. Is that something that you can drive at Vimeo? We talked about needing to serve 8K and the price of storage and compute for those falling on a pretty predictable basis. We need to invent new silicon to support AI workloads. That’s like a whole industry effort, right? And the pressure is all on maybe a handful of companies in one foundry to pull that off. How do you make those bets? I would tell you that we’re doing a lot in evaluating quality across a whole spectrum. One of the things that, as I said to you at the very start, we’re obsessing about is how our creators really want to use AI. They don’t want to be replaced and all this. And so what we’re doing is we’re picking each one of these areas and actually establishing quality frameworks inside of Vimeo — I almost said Google — inside of Vimeo where we’re saying, “Hey, this is high-quality translation,” or, “This is what we need to do to be able to support understanding what changed frame to frame.” And so a lot of what we’re doing is that we’re saying, “Okay, what’s the best model for the job that our creators are going to need to get done?” And then under the surface, we’re stitching all that together so the creator doesn’t even know there might be multiple models that are supporting them. We’ve established quality and then also handoffs for that creator because, as I said to you, we’re creating AI that’s going to be unique to that creator. And so we’re going to remember whether it’s over here in the translation world, over in asking a question, indexing, or otherwise. We stitch it all together for the creator so they don’t even know that we might be using multiple AI, but it’s establishing quality bars for each one of those things. And then also economics — making sure we get the best economics and best performance, like queries per second from the model providers for that area so they can serve our massive minutes of video and number of creators. We’re managing performance, cost, and quality on behalf of the creator across multiple models. Well, Philip, as you can probably tell, I could talk to you forever, but we are out of time. What’s next for Vimeo? Give people a preview of what’s coming up next and we’ll let you get out of here. I’m probably most excited right now, as I mentioned to you, about the massive formats that are coming at the creator. I’m super excited about what can be done with immersive formats. I’m also starting to see a lot of people who want to go back into these sphere-like experiences. I do think that that’s going to be exciting and you’ll see us continue to push the edge there. You’re going to see us invest more in the filmmaking community. Literally on Monday, I’m headed over to the Berlin Film Festival after hopefully, my Philadelphia Eagles do well in the Super Bowl. So you’re going to see us do even more around staff picks and celebrating filmmakers in every geography we serve around the world. I mean, it’s been fairly US-centric, and you’re going to see us get a lot more global in supporting filmmakers. Also, I would tell you as we look over at our enterprise customers, we think we can support customers in their customer journey. This mass proliferation of video across every part of the organization in the service of customers. We’re going to do really well at just-in-time video serving just the right video to just the right person at just the right moment of the customer interaction. So you’ll see us really come out with some exciting things about that between the format and the AI, things we can do to transform storytelling. Amazing. Well, we’ll have to have you back when we do just-in-time immersive video, AKA to both eyes at the same time. Phil, thanks. That’d be amazing. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode?

Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street. Disclaimer: I have a position in NVDA and it is featured in my FindLeadingStocks.com report.

Title: An advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. It's now proving to be a liability.

What did you do last week? Sorry to be so blunt, but federal workers are grappling with that question. DOGE sent an email this weekend asking government employees to list their recent accomplishments before midnight tonight. Many told BI they feel frustrated by the request. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, instructed staff not to respond. In today's big story, getting an advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. Now, it's proving to be a liability on your résumé. What's on deck Markets: The takeaways from Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Tech: A former big-time Elon Musk believer makes the case for why Tesla is in trouble this year. Business: The Russian media oligarch pushing Putin to even further extremes. But first, school's out forever. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Their degrees were something for them to fall back on. Instead, they're in a free fall. Job seekers with advanced degrees are having a much harder time finding work compared to their less-educated peers, writes Business Insider's Aki Ito. These days, you're better off with just a high school diploma instead of a Ph.D. if you want to find work fast. People who didn't go to college can get work twice as quickly as those with advanced degrees. (Let's be clear: Advanced-degree holders still largely rule the roost on compensation. But pay only matters once you have a job.) Aki has previously written about the struggles of white-collar workers thanks to hiring reductions among tech and finance firms. Those are common landing spots for people with advanced degrees, which might be why extra education isn't paying off in the job hunt. However, Aki's story explores whether the labor market's latest shift could signal a bigger change in the importance of education. All of this is also happening at a time when colleges are facing a reckoning. Some say you can't put a price on education, but universities have certainly tried. With the cost of a four-year degree at a private college easily surpassing $250,000, more and more young people are questioning the benefits of college, let alone grad school. Another corner of the job market that was once a sure thing is also getting shaken up. Government jobs, traditionally considered a stable paycheck with good benefits, have been upended by the Trump administration. (Just reread the intro to this newsletter if you need a recent example.) Tens of thousands of employees took buyouts, and thousands of probationary workers were fired during the first month of the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting efforts.It's still unclear the impact these job cuts will have on the wider labor market. But continuing to make wholesale changes to the largest employer in the US, which is known for its job security, will likely have some residual effect. 1. Warren Buffett's tax bill was a doozy. Berkshire Hathaway, the legendary investor's conglomerate, paid a record $26.8 billion in taxes last year, Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. It's the most paid by any US company in history and represents about 5% of total American corporate income taxes paid in 2024. "Spend it wisely," Buffett wrote. The letter also included some more fundamental business — and life — lessons, too. 2. The meme coin explosion. Once an obscure corner of crypto, meme coins have taken on a life — and market — of their own. But scams are common with meme coins, and ongoing conversations about a regulatory path are another big question mark. 3. How a hedge fund repays $1.2 billion to investors heading for the exits. The past few years have been rocky for Paloma Partners, posting just a 2.5% return in 2024. The multistrategy hedge fund said last fall it would take time to repay departing investors. To meet redemption requests, Paloma plans to pull $600 million from hedge funds it backed, including the quant firm Aquatic Capital, according to four people familiar with the matter. 1. An early Tesla investor is now bearish on the stock. Ross Gerber was among the first to spot Tesla's potential, but he isn't feeling so confident now. Gerber doubts the company can achieve Full Self-Driving on time without switching hardware, and he believes Elon Musk has too many pots in the fire. 2. We're hiring … just not humans. Originally created as an experiment, two founders built a jobs board for AI agents. The jobs board, dubbed "Job for Agent," provides insight into what companies might look for in an AI workforce. 3. AI bosses feel the pressure. In a recent interview, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic spoke about the weight of responsibility that comes with ushering in AI. The leaders urged people to better grasp the real force for change they expect AI to be — and for societies to start planning accordingly. 1. The oligarch who wants to "Make Russia Great Again." There is one Russian nationalist currently in the spotlight who may be even more zealous than Vladimir Putin. Konstantin Malofeyev operates Tsargrad, a multimedia platform with over three million followers. He embraces Trumpian rhetoric and helped organize the Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's Donbas region, paving the way for Putin's invasion. But Malofeyev thinks Putin isn't doing enough to crush Ukraine. 2. Scaredy-cat capitalism in the new Trump era. While deregulation and tax cuts are generally favored by corporate America, Trump and his policies aren't exactly predictable. That's leading some companies — from Meta to Disney — to brace for his whims. Many businesses are trying to get in Trump's good graces by cutting back on DEI and handing over a check. 3. You might be waiting on your tax return this year. The Internal Revenue Service began firing probationary workers last week who were not "critical" to tax filing season. These terminations are part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, but it could result in more backlogs, slower customer service, and delayed refunds, tax experts and IRS employees told BI. An IRS HR employee said the firings, coupled with a hiring freeze, could set the agency behind on its functions well into 2026.

Apple is set to face a showdown with shareholders this week as it prepares to defend its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies against critical opponents in its investor base. The iPhone maker is scheduled to meet investors Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting, where a vote is expected on a motion put forward by the National Center for Public Policy Research to cease DEI efforts. The organization, a conservative think tank in Washington, DC, argued that US Supreme Court cases had called into question the legality of corporate DEI programs, putting employers at risk of discrimination claims. Apple, the world's most valuable company, said in a filing that it would oppose the proposal because it "inappropriately attempts" to restrict how the company manages its operations. It comes at a time when its Big Tech counterparts have been rolling back DEI initiatives. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced it would cut its DEI programs. The company told employees that the "legal and policy landscape" around DEI efforts in the US was changing. Other companies that have rolled back programs include Google, which said this month that it would no longer pursue hiring goals based on DEI, and Amazon, which has changed references about DEI benefits on some of its websites. Though some companies began shifting focus away from DEI before the election, several tech leaders have recently reacted to President Donald Trump's deeming DEI efforts "wasteful." Apple's decision to stand by its DEI policies could weigh on its relationship with the president. CEO Tim Cook has tried to build a good rapport with Trump, visiting his Mar-a-Lago resort in December. On Monday, Apple announced a plan to hire about 20,000 people over the next four years as part of a commitment to invest more than $500 billion in US projects. Apple is a rare holdout among tech firms stepping back from DEI initiatives. Large shareholders in its investor base, such as BlackRock, have kept a distance from activist campaigns. Shareholder proposals don't always end up on a company's ballot. A review by the consultancy ISS-Corporate found that proposals against ESG policies, including those against DEI, that came to a vote had garnered little support in the past three years. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Where Germany Goes From Here

It is salutary to remember that the man set to take over Germany has not had any role in government. Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats won a comfortable if unconvincing victory in Sunday’s elections, will form a government at a time of tumult on multiple fronts. He faces an economy reeling from a decade of under-investment and entering its third year of recession, an immigration crisis exacerbated by a series of lone terror attacks, and the ever-growing popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Most of all it is facing the unprecedented collapse of relations with the U.S., on whom Germans have relied on for security since the end of World War Two. Read More: Exclusive: Alice Weidel on Her Far-Right AfD Party’s Rise, Elon Musk’s Support, and the German Election Merz would see himself as a classic Conservative of the old school, somewhere perhaps between Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, a believer in traditional social values and the established security and political architecture of the postwar era that has bound Germans into the Transatlantic alliance. When Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. President in November, Merz was confident he could do business with him—two fist-pumping men who wanted to slash bureaucracy, cut taxes, and wage war on “woke.” Yet the confrontational approach of Trump’s lieutenants at the recent Munich Security Conference—in which they lauded praise on the AfD—has changed that. The 69-year-old Merz—a man who has interspersed politics with boardroom life as Chairman of the German arm of Blackrock, the investment house—is keen not to waste time. As he made clear during his victory speech, “the world isn’t waiting for us.” Germany, he added, could not spend months haggling over the finer points of a coalition agreement while Ukraine’s fate is decided by Trump and the man whom they feel has captured him, Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Kaja Kallas, the E.U.’s chief diplomat, reiterated that point, expressing the hope that a new government is formed “as quickly as possible, as we really need to move on with decisions at the European level which requires German participation.” With Emmanuel Macron in Washington today, and Keir Starmer following on Thursday, Europe is seeking to persuade Trump to step back from his seeming endorsement of Putin’s Ukraine position. Both the French and British leaders have been coordinating their positions, stressing the need for quiet diplomacy. But within hours of securing his election victory, Merz appeared to take a more confrontational approach toward the White House. “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said Sunday, before even the final election tally came in. Some wondered whether this might be another example of an impetuousness that is seen, even by his confidants, as a weak spot in Merz’s character. Yet he doubled down on his position the following morning: “Now more than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength. For a just peace, the attacked country must be part of peace negotiations.” For such talk to have substance, Merz will have to show that he is prepared to borrow more to ramp up Germany’s defense budget. A decade after NATO members agreed to devote a minimum of 2% of GDP for military spending, Germany only reached that target in 2024. In order to increase it to 2.5%, let alone a new 3% target, will cost tens of billions. For that, the incoming government will have to reform its so-called “debt brake” that places stringent limits on public debt. It seems that Merz is prepared to do that, with the support of the center-left Social Democrats. The outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s SPD suffered a humiliating result, falling into third place to a historic low. They are now expected to play a junior role in a center-right administration. Yet some of Merz’s agenda will be hard for it to accede to, particularly elements of his economic reform package such as welfare cuts and tax breaks, and his plans to crack down hard on illegal migration. In one respect, the row with Trump makes Merz’s task harder; it is a warning to mainstream on the politicians on both the left and right of what may follow if they fail to form a durable coalition. Encouraged by its best-ever result, with 20% of the vote, and boosted by the boisterous support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump Administration, the AfD is waiting in the wings. It is preparing a second front of attack the moment the new government faces its next crisis. The far-right in Germany is confident that its moment will come, again. Contact us at letters@time.com

Title: German election: Who won, who lost and what’s next?

Christian Democrats came first. Their leader, Friedrich Merz, is expected to be next chancellor. But the far right and the left were the top gainers. The conservative Christian Democrats have won Germany’s national election, putting them on track to lead the next coalition government, according to provisional results. The outcome means the party’s leader, Friedrich Merz, will likely be Germany’s next chancellor. Here’s a breakdown of Sunday’s election results and what to expect from Germany’s next leadership: Conservative and right-wing parties emerged on top. The mainstream conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), along with its partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), finished first with 28.6 percent of the vote, while the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged into second with 20.8 percent, according to provisional results announced by election authorities. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in third with just 16.4 percent, a nearly 10-point drop from their first-place finish in 2021. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz of SPD acknowledged a “bitter” defeat, saying “the election result is poor and I bear responsibility”. Germany’s Greens and the far-left Die Linke, or The Left, party exceeded the 5 percent threshold to secure seats in parliament, with 11.6 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. As a result, the CDU/CSU partnership is projected to secure 208 seats in the Bundestag, the German parliament, the AfD 152, the SPD 120, the Greens 85 and The Left 64. The 69-year-old CDU leader is a multimillionaire lawyer who has been in and out of politics for decades. He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1989, and by 2000 had become chairman of the CDU’s parliamentary alliance. However, fellow party member Angela Merkel eventually pushed Merz aside, and he left parliament in 2009 to jump into the private sector, working for multinational companies like Mayer Brown and BlackRock Germany. Merz was re-elected leader of the CDU in 2022 after Merkel retired from politics following her 16-year-long stint as the country’s chancellor. A social conservative who has broached the idea of a new European defence coalition, Merz says he plans to govern Germany “reliably” and push for European “independence” from the United States. “That is my absolute priority, I have no illusions at all about what will come out of America,” Merz said on Sunday, amid growing public differences between European leaders and US President Donald Trump over Ukraine and US security cover for Europe. Soon after his party’s victory on Monday, Merz went on to pledge that Europe will “remain firmly by” Ukraine, which he said must play a role in any peace negotiations. The far-right party finished just after Merz’s CDU, with 20.8 percent of the vote, double their 2021 support. It is projected to win 152 seats in parliament. That marks the strongest showing by a far-right movement in Germany since the end of World War II. The AfD’s rise highlights its growing populist appeal among voters who are critical of immigration and the European Union, especially in eastern Germany, where it outperformed all other parties. Despite little chance of the AfD being invited into a coalition, the party, led by 46-year-old Alice Weidel, is celebrating what it believes to be a victory, positioning a once-fringe force firmly in the mainstream of Europe’s right wing. The results are also expected to further strengthen the AfD’s clout in the German parliament, where it scored a big win in January when Merz and the CDU — for all of their talk of not allying with the far-right party — turned to Weidel’s group for votes to push through a bill calling for tougher restrictions on immigration. The Left won 8.8 percent of the vote, nearly doubling its share from the last election. It performed especially well in the capital, Berlin, surpassing all parties with 19.9 percent of the vote. That puts it on track to win 64 seats in the Bundestag. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), a populist left-wing party formed last year after a split with The Left, took 4.97 percent of the vote. That was just shy of the 5 percent hurdle needed to take seats in the Bundestag, meaning larger parties would get more seats. The Social Democrats’ two outgoing coalition partners – the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) – also took a hit in the elections. The Greens won 11.6 percent of the vote, a 3 percent drop from the 2021 elections. The party’s chancellor candidate, Robert Habeck, conceded it was “not a good result” and said he would no longer seek a leading role in the party. The FDP, which effectively triggered the snap election by abandoning the coalition over a budget dispute, fared worse, getting just 4.3 percent of the vote. Since the party did not win any constituencies, and its national vote is below the 5 percent threshold required to hold seats in parliament allocated through proportional representation, it is projected to lose all 91 seats it has held since 2021. As its poor result became clear, leader Christian Lindner announced he would leave active politics. “The German election brought defeat for the FDP, but hopefully a new start for Germany. This is what I fought for,” he said in a post on X. Die Bundestagswahl brachte eine Niederlage für die FDP, aber hoffentlich einen Neuanfang für Deutschland. Dafür hatte ich gekämpft. Nun scheide ich aus der aktiven Politik aus. Mit nur einem Gefühl: Dankbarkeit für fast 25 intensive, herausfordernde Jahre voller Gestaltung und… pic.twitter.com/UuT1jTUeRW — Christian Lindner (@c_lindner) February 23, 2025 Merz will now begin the tough task of forming a coalition government. To do so, he needs to shore up at least 316 seats in the 630-member Bundestag. He has ruled out working with the far-right AfD, saying they have “fundamentally different views”, despite joining hands with the party in January over the immigration bill. That means his best bet is likely a two-way alliance with the SPD, which would come out to 328 seats. The CDU/CSU and the SPD have ruled through so-called grand coalitions four times in the past — between 1966 and 1969 in West Germany, and thrice since reunification, under Merkel’s chancellorship. A three-way partnership with the Greens and The Left would likely require more concessions from Merz’s centrist CDU and be more fragile. The Greens support higher taxes on the wealthy and renewable energy, while Merz favours corporate tax cuts and nuclear energy. The Left also backs higher taxes for the rich and advocates laxer immigration policies, conflicting with Merz’s stance to curb immigration and ramp up deportations. The composition of the next government is also likely to influence the foreign policy stances that Merz, who aims for Germany to play a leading role in European affairs and help unite the continent, can adopt. “If it winds up being a coalition with two parties – with Merz and CDU, and the centre left – that puts him [Merz] in a stronger position,” global strategy adviser Marco Vicenzino told Al Jazeera. “If it has to go into a three-party coalition, it gets into a weaker position.” With major defence challenges facing Europe, particularly due to the war in Ukraine, the European Union’s foreign policy chief urged German parties to form a coalition quickly “I hope that they do it as fast as possible, because we really need to move on with the decisions also on the European level that require German participation,” said Kaja Kallas. Merz said he hoped to form a new government by Easter, April 20, 2025. Party leaders have hailed AfD’s performance and argued it should be represented in the next coalition government. “We have achieved something historic today,” AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla said to cheering supporters on Sunday. “We are now the political centre and we have left the fringes behind us.” Weidel said the party remains open to joining a coalition and claimed that if Merz partners with left-wing parties instead, that would be “electoral fraud”. If that happens, she added, “next time we’ll come first”. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier by Matthew Weinzierl and Brendan Rosseau Harvard Business Review Press, 2025 hardcover, 320 pp., illus. ISBN 978-1-64782-716-8 US$32 At Blue Origin, the company with the motto “Gradatim ferociter” or “step by step ferociously,” the steps have been a little more ferocious so far this year. The company finally conducted its first New Glenn orbital launch in January, a mission that was mostly successful other than a failed booster landing. Earlier this month, the company launched its New Shepard suborbital vehicle, demonstrating the ability to provide simulated lunar gravity for the payloads inside for about two minutes. This week, the company will launch another New Shepard carrying six private astronauts. But, earlier this month, the company also announced it was laying off about 10% of its workforce, at least 1,000 employees. Dave Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company had created “more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed” as it grew significantly in recent years. The layoffs were intended to address those concerns, reducing both engineering and management positions. Limp, a longtime Amazon executive, was hired a little more than a year ago by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos to make the company more decisive. ““He said he didn’t think Blue needed another rocket scientist,” Limp said of Bezos at the Commercial Space Conference in Washington a day before he announced the layoffs. “What we needed was a little bit more organization, a little more decisiveness, some manufacturing expertise.” Those events demonstrated that technical success is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success in commercial space: companies, even those backed by billionaires, must eventually demonstrate that they can provide a product that meets the needs of customers and in a way that is financially sustainable. That is at the core of Space to Grow, a new book by Matthew Weinzierl, a professor at Harvard Business School (HBS), and Brendan Rosseau, a former teaching fellow and research associate there. The authors, who created a space economics project at HBS, make clear they see tremendous opportunity for the commercial space industry thanks to the reduced costs to build and launch spacecraft and the growing value of services provided by those satellites in communications, Earth observation, and other sectors. But while they call this a “revolution,” this is book is not an uncritical, overzealous look at the space industry, but one grounded in the rigors of economics. Many of the chapters in the book are case studies of some major space companies: Blue Origin, Planet, SpaceX, and others. Those chapters trace the rise (and sometimes fall: one of the profiled companies is defunct asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources) of these companies, including how they responded to, and sometimes reshaped, the markets. That is tied to what can be considered the book’s central theme, that under certain conditions, markets are efficient. They use economic concepts throughout the book to support their analyses of the companies they profile. Those concepts range from simple supply-and-demand curves to more advanced concepts like the Le Chatelier principle, which explains how decreasing the cost of the supply of a product or service may create only modest increases in demand in the short term, but larger changes in the long term as the market takes more advantage of that less expensive supply. Fortunately, you do not need a background in economics to appreciate that: Weinzierl and Rosseau do a good job explaining those concepts in plain language. They acknowledge that, despite that central theme, markets are not always efficient. They discuss market failures like orbital debris, where there are limited incentives for satellite operators to pay to clean up their defunct satellites, along with regulatory obstacles. They also cite concerns of monopoly power that SpaceX in particular holds in the launch sector; competition, they note, is one of those “certain conditions” required for markets to be efficient. Much of the background about the companies in the book will be familiar to readers, but the economic framing is useful for people inside and outside the industry alike. The authors stop short of making specific recommendations for companies or policymakers, but it’s clear they see potential for efficient markets to enable further growth of the industry. In light of the recent events at Blue Origin, it was worth examining that chapter in detail to review their assessment of the company. A “monumental turning point” for the company, in the words of former president Rob Meyerson, was the decision not to bid on the next phase of NASA’s commercial crew program in 2012 after participating in earlier phases. By doing so, Weinzierl and Rosseau state, Blue Origin was “denying itself the discipline imposed by the market forces that are at the heart of the commercial space revolution’s promise” and acting more like a “philanthropic nonprofit than like a space startup.” That appears to be changing now, both with Blue Origin’s technical accomplishments and its internal shakeups. “We have made a lot of progress in the past year on fundamentals and acting quickly and turning us into a world-class manufacturing company, and focusing the company,” Limp said at the Commercial Space Conference. “I think we’ve made some progress. We have a lot to do this year, too.” Note: the authors provided me with a galley of Space to Grow and requested a blurb about the book, which was included in the published version. That blurb reflected my sincere opinion of the book, described in far greater detail in this review.

Title: After Germany’s Right-Wing Gains in Elections, New Conservative Leader Vows to ‘Achieve Independence’ From U.S. Under Trump’s Rule

By Ed Meza @edmezavar While the far right made historic gains in Germany’s pivotal federal elections on Sunday, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party ultimately thrived with Friedrich Merz securing nearly 29% of the vote and placing him in the top spot to lead the country. Poised to become Germany’s next chancellor, Merz has yet to form a coalition with at least one other party in order to secure a majority in the German parliament, but he has already vowed to “achieve independence from the U.S.A.” in view of President Donald Trump’s indifference towards Europe. These elections, which saw a record-breaking voter turnout of 83.5% (the highest since unification in 1990), saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party make historic gains to become the second largest political force in the country. Related Stories VIP+ YouTube’s ‘New TV’ Rationale: Distance From Its ‘Adpocalypse’ Past 'The Drew Barrymore Show' Scores Most-Watched Week Ever (EXCLUSIVE) With around 21% of the vote, the AfD nearly doubled its result from four years ago as immigration, crime, inflation, unemployment and the war in Ukraine became hot-button issues that helped galvanized support for the populist, Eurosceptic party, which leads in eastern Germany. The rise of the far right in the country has also been fueled by a series of attacks that have involved immigrants, the latest of which happened on Feb. 13 in Munich, on the eve of the Berlin Film Festival, and caused dozens of injuries. Popular on Variety Sunday’s snap election was triggered by the collapse in November of Germany’s coalition government made up of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-of-center Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP). Disputes over budget and economic policy led Scholz to fire FDP finance minister Christian Lindner, ending the coalition. For the moment, there appears no chance of the AfD joining a new government with the CDU as Merz has rejected forming a coalition with the party, which remains a pariah in Germany’s political establishment. The AfD has nevertheless won strong support from the Trump administration – Musk in particular has championed it as the only party “that can save Germany.” For Merz, that support appears to have gone too far. Taking part in a discussion on broadcaster ARD on Sunday, Merz said it was his “absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can really achieve independence from the U.S.A. as quickly as possible.” Merz, a traditionally pro-American politician and former exec at Blackrock, said he would have never imagined saying something like that on television but stressed that Trump’s recent statements made it clear that his administration was “largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” He also questioned the future of NATO and said it may be necessary to establish an independent European defense capability, noting that he had “no illusions at all about what is happening in America — just look at the recent interference in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk. “The interference from Washington was no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interference we saw from Moscow,” he added. “We are under so much pressure here from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.” German security officials have accused Russian actors of spreading disinformation online with fabricated videos claiming election fraud in the country in the run-up to Sunday’s vote. For Merz, navigating such a new kind of relationship with the U.S. may be challenging despite his own extensive ties to the business world. A corporate lawyer, Merz served as a member of parliament, or the Bundestag, from 1994 to 2009, when he left politics for a private sector career that saw him take seats on numerous corporate boards, including that of supervisory board chairman of Blackrock Germany from 2016 to 2020. What effect those ties may have on his administration remains to be seen. Merz’s election was actually welcomed by Trump who hailed it as “a great day” for Germany in a post on his social network Social Truth on Sunday. “It looks like the conservative party in Germany has won the elections… This is a great day for Germany and the United States of America, under the leadership of a ‘gentleman’… Congratulations to everyone,” Trump wrote. Trump is not the only problem Germany is facing. The country is currently undergoing a period of economic decline as it struggles with such major challenges as inflation, immigration and the consequences of the war in Ukraine, including the end of cheap Russian gas that for decades powered Germany’s industrial might. While votes are still being tallied late into the night Sunday, a coalition between the CDU and the SPD, which managed 16% of the vote, or a larger one with the SPD and Green Party (12%) is seen as likely. However, political analysts see a three-way coalition as potentially dysfunctional due to the major policy differences between the CDU and Greens. Taking part in a roundtable discussion on Sunday on broadcaster ARD, AfD head and chancellor candidate Alice Weidel said the CDU had “completely copied our program, adopted our entire position” but would “not be able to implement it with leftist parties.” Weidel said the AfD was extending its hand to the CDU, noting that Merz may not be willing to accept it but perhaps others in the CDU would. Weidel warned that a coalition between the CDU, SPD and Greens would result in an “unstable government that would not last four years” and the AfD would end up overtaking the CDU in the next few years. While widely rejected by the establishment, the AfD and its policies, including its stark anti-immigration stance and demonization of pro-Palestinian activists, seem to have had a profound impact on Germany’s other leading parties. The AfD’s stance on cultural issues was also evident in the recent revamp of federal film funding. The AfD has long rejected diversity, gender equality, inclusion, anti-discrimination and sustainability as film funding criteria – standards that were championed by Green Party culture minister Claudia Roth in her ambitious reform of film funding legislation. Yet, it was the FDP that killed the draft law’s planned diversity advisory board and ecological sustainability guidelines when it agreed to provide its decisive vote for the measure in December, saying it was seeking to do away with “bureaucratic advisory councils.” The reform nevertheless managed to extend and increase two key funding incentives, implementing one of three planned measures that also included a 30% tax incentive and an investment obligation for streamers and broadcasters. Some industry players are eager to see the new government tackle those measures, others less so. In a statement to Variety, Fred Kogel, CEO of leading entertainment giant Leonine Studios, said: “We’re confident that the new government under the leadership of Friedrich Merz will be formed quickly and will help our country move forward. Over the course of the last months, we held constructive talks with members of the CDU/CSU, SPD and Bündnis 90/Die Grünen [the Greens] who recognize the cultural and economic importance of Germany as a media hub. “We now need to build on this,” Kogel added. “The rapid introduction of a tax incentive and an investment obligation with a legally regulated reversion of rights to producers remains our key message to the new government. This is a long overdue step and the only way to restore Germany’s international competitiveness as a media location and as a relevant player in the global production business.” Björn Böhning, CEO of the Produktionsallianz industry association, added: “Germany urgently needs a stable and capable federal government. The film and television production industry also depends on planning security and sustainable framework conditions. The international competitiveness of Germany as a film location stands and falls with the continuation of the film reform that has begun. It is high time to finally hold international streaming providers accountable and ensure that rights to German productions do not migrate abroad unhindered.” The Produktionsallianz therefore calls on the new federal government to approve the investment commitment as well as the planned tax incentive within the 100-day program of its term in office, Böhning said. Vaunet, the association of private broadcasters, is vehemently opposed to an investment obligation for VoD providers, which, it argues, restricts programming freedom and would not necessarily lead to an increase in investments in Germany. It does back the new tax incentive plan, however. Vaunet expressed hope that a new government would improve economic prospects and create a fairer environment. “The audio and audiovisual sector is both an economic and a cultural asset: Securing the economic foundations and freedom of programming as well as protecting content is crucial for the activities of journalistic and editorial media and thus for our democracy. “Vaunet therefore expects a new government to bring about a rapid and sustainable improvement in the economic framework, especially in the areas of refinancing through advertising, as well as preventing further burdens on media providers and equalizing the level playing field with the big tech platforms. Strong and competitive private media are the guarantee of media diversity in Germany and an important driver of the cultural and creative industries.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Germany Holds an Election in an Alternate Reality

Germany held an election yesterday. It went about as expected. The biggest surprise continues to be how the majority of parties all support some flavor of ongoing belligerence towards Russia — a policy that is destroying Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) achieved its best result in any national vote (20.8 percent) since it was founded in 2013. The party which started out more as an anti-EU, anti-NATO party and became more ethno nationalist and now favors both an end to conflict with Russia as well as strong ties with the US, looks likely to be excluded from government according to statements from Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leaders. The pro-war, capital-friendly CDU came in first with 28.6 percent and will likely head the next government with former Blackrock executive Friedrich Merz at the helm. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centrist Social Democratic Party (SPD) was rewarded for its disastrous governance of the past four years with its worst national election result (16.4 percent) in more than a century. Yet its stance on “supporting” Ukraine remains unchanged. And the warmongering Greens lost a few points from 2021 but remained mostly steady with 11.6 percent of the vote. As of Monday morning in Berlin the anti-war Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is at 4.97 percent, which means the party would just miss getting into the Bundestag. Some BSW members are crying foul: The Germans abroad referenced by De Masi cannot vote at embassies or consulates and postal delays might have prevented their ballots from arriving on time. Euronews, for example, reports on abroad voters still waiting for their ballots on Thursday, which even if returned immediately via express mail would have been unlikely to arrive before the 6 pm Sunday deadline. Here are some possibilities on the future governing coalition from Deutsche Welle: To form a government, a majority of at least 316 seats out of the 630 seats in the Bundestag is needed. A coalition between CDU and AfD would have been possible numerically, as both parties easily pass this threshhold, adding up to 358. But according to conservative leader Friedrich Merz, this is out of the question. That leaves Olaf Scholz’s SPD as a possible partner, which together with CDU scrape by with 328 seats. A bigger majority could be formed if CDU were to add the Greens to the mix, reaching 416. But the CDU’s junior partner CSU has repeatedly ruled out governing with the Greens. Over the coming days and weeks a coalition will likely be formed, voter shifts will be dissected, and campaign promises will fade away. There will be plenty of time to examine that, but here I’d like to pose a few questions. Will the new chancellor and the new government be able to confront reality and begin to seek a path out of Germany current …predicament? How could they do so? And are any of the parties that will be seated in the upcoming Bundestag even asking the right questions that would lead to possible answers? Germany’s House of Mirrors Germany’s political elite largely represented by the four parties (the CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens, and the Free Democratic Party, which fell below the five percent threshold to be seated in the Bundestag) remain stuck in the “rules-based order” transatlantic fantasyland championing their democracy and liberal values while demonizing Russia, reality is at the gates. It’s increasingly difficult to square that paradigm while remaining obsessed with supporting Israel’s genocide campaign and criminalizing speech (notice JD Vance in his widely celebrated Munich dress down didn’t criticize Germany’s heavy handed approach when it comes to this area of free speech). But more than anything it is an economy circling the drain, which is largely the result of the war against Russia, as well as hitching itself to the US empire with a more combative stance against Beijing. And for all the talk of a US-Russia peace, what do we have so far? Let’s cut away all the headline-grabbing transatlantic political fights and look at the ways Germany and Europe remain on autopilot on a journey to becoming the next Ukraine: The madwoman in Berlin, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock let the cat out of the bag on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that $700 billion is coming. She told Berliner Zeitung the following: “We will launch a large package that has never been seen on this scale before,” said Baerbock. “Similar to the euro or the [Coronavirus] crisis, there is now a financial package for security in Europe. That will come in the near future.” According to Baerbock, the deal will be announced sometime after the German election. The package is believed to include money for ​​”military training, the acceleration of relief efforts, arms deliveries and what Europe could offer for security guarantees.” Merz, too, is reportedly on board. He had this to say following yesterday’s victory. From DW: The favorite for the future German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, sharply criticized Donald Trump’s administration and urged Europe to distance [itself] from Washington during a post-election panel airing on state broadcaster ARD. “I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of EU states and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US, step by step,” Merz said. “Step by step” is doing a lot of work there. Merz was after all recently floating the idea of buying F-35s from the US. How will the European public, which has largely soured on the war, react to more power going to Brussels and loads of debt in order to keep losing to the Russians? The humiliation from the US has been so thorough — self-inflicted by Europe but humiliating nonetheless — while the propaganda against Russia so relentless for years, I wonder if we’re going to see a rally around the EU flag moment similar to the time after the official start of the Ukraine war in 2022. The hatred and fear of Russia certainly remains strong: One factor limiting the stimulus to be had from rearmament is that Europe buys much of its military gear from American suppliers. Former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s competitiveness report estimated that 78% of purchases come from production outside the EU—and 63% from the US alone. That means any “multiplier” effect of stepped-up spending on growth would be low. What’s more, recruiting more Europeans to the military and defense industry would bring down unemployment, possibly fueling inflationary pressures that would lead to higher interest rates. In all, Rush calculates that EU economic output might be higher by about 0.6% in 2028, “which implies a modest nudge up in GDP growth in the next few years.” And yet the priority is more weapons to fund an unwinnable war and prevent the Russians from conquering Europe — a threat for which there is still no evidence and makes no sense if you spend ten seconds thinking about it. But on the plus side from the perspective of the European vultures, it provides cover to continue dismantling the welfare state and privatize everything from infrastructure to social services. The US and Russia could work out some rapprochement, which some in Washington believe will help with other wars in the Middle East, as well as the looming confrontation with China. Meanwhile, the EU continues to piss into the tent, and should talks between Washington and Moscow fall apart, Europe’s militarization is setting it up to become the next Ukraine. That would certainly “extend” Russia as the famous 2019 RAND report suggested. At the very least, Europe’s doubling down on suicidal belligerence ensures that it remains walled off from the Eurasian project for the foreseeable future, and the US can focus its efforts on blowing up other bridges in the world’s heartland. One would have thought that the US would have had to stay in the heavyweight fight against Russia in order to continue to profit off of Europe’s misery, but this line of thinking might have underestimated the EU’s impotence. As of now, it looks like the EU countries are content with ongoing vassalage despite the increasing abuse coming from Washington. What Is Needed to Get Germany — and Europe — out of This Mess? The New York Times ran a Friday guest essay by one Konstantin Richter entitled “Germany Is in Big Trouble, and Nobody Knows What to Do About It.” What? There are plenty of people who have been saying for the past three years (at least) that Germany was heading down a ruinous path. To change course all it would take would be a minimal amount of courage to imagine Germany as part of Eurasia, break with transatlantic slavishness — including quitting NATO, repair ties itself with Russia, take up China on its offer to merge the Belt and Road Initiative with Europe’s Global Gateway, and forge stronger ties in other areas. Rather than spend untold billions on arming against some imaginary Russian invasion, the EU could use that money to rebuild its economies with the help of Russian energy, Chinese investment, and integration with Eurasia. Yet, there are no signs this is being considered — at least not yet. Why, for example, are European heads of state not requesting their own bilateral talks with Russia? There is nothing preventing them from doing so. Why not resurrect the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe? At some point — one way or another — Europe is going to have to come to terms with Russia’s desire for a new European security architecture agreement. Do any of Germany’s leaders look capable of such a task? Are they even thinking about it? Are any in Europe for that matter? Maybe Orban? What’s on Offer Instead? Well, let’s take a brief look at the positions of the parties in yesterday’s election. Merz and the CDU. They represent the status quo with regards to Russia and atlanticism with more financialization to boot. Merz is the author of 2008 book “Dare more capitalism” and dare he does. The former Blackrock executive loves himself some privatization and deregulation. German workers are likely to see their living standards continue to decline under a Merz government. Merz likes to talk about Germany taking on a leadership role in Europe. What does that entail? Here’s a taste: International fugitive and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a “warm conversation” with new German chancellor Friedrich Merz. Despite an ICC arrest warrant, Merz said he would invite Netanyahu to Germany, according to Netanyahu’s office. — jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) February 24, 2025 Here’s what the European Council on Foreign Relations expects: Should Merz triumph, the new German government will have a mandate to pursue a foreign policy based on integration steps concerning defence spending and debt-sponsored innovation policies. Eventually, Germany will be less likely to aim for the broad supranational alliances it previously developed to ensure no state was left behind. Instead, a ‘two-speed Europe’ is likely—although it come at the cost of alienating Germany’s core EU partner, France. …apart from Merz, the CDU’s leaders are generally younger—the powerful leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik Wüst, is 49; the informal leader of the CDU’s conservative wing, Jens Spahn, is 44. Politically socialised in a reunified Germany, this new generation refers to their country as a clear leader in both Europe and the EU. Their parents were born after the second world war, while their grandparents—who might retain some connection to the post-war order—have long since passed away. Consequently, they lack the ties which defined previous generations of German leaders. To them, restraint is a foreign policy concept not rooted in personal conviction. AfD – Who knows? What Wolfgang Streeck said last year in an interview with Die Zeit about the AfD rings increasingly true: ​​I don’t know a single consistent thought from [Bjorn] Höcke and his followers. It’s all just cynical symbolic provocations. Lately that lack of consistency means taking a more friendly turn towards the US. The party that started out as an anti-EU and morphed more into an anti-immigrant has long been hated and feared by the German political-media establishment. Yes, it has a small core support from neo Nazis, but the real reason was its anti-NATO stance, brutal honesty about Berlin being a “slave” to the US, and a desire to make nice with Moscow seeing as it is in the national interest of Germany to do so. Well, last month the AfD adopted a motion in support of Germany and the US building closer relations, and it has embraced of Elon Musk and the Trump administration. So one can expect it to be an extension of the US rebrand in Europe. The shift also shows up in polling. German public opinion begins to take a more realistic view of the country’s relationship with the US: But the AfD supporters, unlike other German voters, are softening their stance towards Washington: Streeck, in that interview with Die Zeit, continued: Conservatives on the right believe in a natural hierarchy, a world in which the better ones are there to tell the less good ones what to do. But I am an unconverted egalitarian: all people are of equal value. Furthermore, right-wing conservatives believe that there can be no peace in this world: there are Schmittian existential enemies with whom we can only live if we don’t let them live. The latter has become a central theme of the American neocons and the European NATO conservatives, including our foreign minister. Zeit: Are you comparing Annalena Baerbock to Höcke? Streeck: If you say that this war can only end when we hand Putin over to The Hague, then that means final victory: German tanks in Moscow. And I say we should think about that again. And that leads us to… The Greens At least we know what we’re going to get here: more crazy, exemplified by Baerbock. Annalena Baerbock is apparently still angry about Russia’s WW2 defeat of Nazi Germany. Baerbock fixates on the Oder River, where her Nazi grandfather fought against Russia. Imagine the anti-Russia hatred in the Baerbock households during Annalena’s formative years. https://t.co/esk9rOsgZ0 pic.twitter.com/ujWx2IV3JX — ⏳Towhee 🌏☮️ (@amborin) February 21, 2025 The Greens are already angling to get into the next government with the party’s Bundestag leader, Britta Haßelmann, telling DW that the Greens are now more of a governing party than an opposition party. Wonderful. SPD. Representative of the “center.” Largely on board with Germany’s neoliberal war path, but might get there slower than the Greens and CDU. Die Linke. The Left Party collapsed in recent years after abandoning nearly all of its former working class platform in favor of identity politics in an attempt to appear “ready to govern.” The party saw a resurgence in response to the AfD’s rise, as well as a renewed focus on economic issues. It also softened key foreign policy stances including dropping any pretense of opposition to NATO, and there’s no evidence that the party is prepared to consider what is necessary to get Germany out of the hole it has dug for itself. BSW. Sahra Wagenknecht from the party that bears her name might be the one politician who grasps the enormity of Germany’s challenge and what it takes to tackle them. She’s been pushing the balancing of ties between the US and Eurasia and rebuilding German industry while also curtailing immigration. Alas, as of Monday morning in Germany BSW is only at 4.9 percent — just short of the 5 needed to get the party’s anti-war voice in the Bundestag. If Merz and company are serious about moving forward with hundreds of billions for militarization, it’s hard to see how the situation in Germany doesn’t go from a disaster to devastation. Even without that colossal misstep, it still appears as though the situation is destined to get a lot worse before it can get better. It all brings to mind something Glenn Diesen wrote the other day: … idealism is dangerous as unrealistic demands and uncompromising moral slogans are destroying both Ukraine and Europe. A key rule in political realism is that refusing to accept the world as it is will result in devastation. Once Trump’s team settled on a plan regarding Ukraine-Russia-Europe events and policy changes have been moving so fast these recent weeks, I’m half expecting Trump to announce an alliance with Russia against Ukraine and Europe. I jest, but never expected such quick US reproachment towards Russia. But Trump’s swift reproachment with Russia comes with a warning: Why is he doing it? So that the US can next try to drive a wedge between Russia and China. He motives I suspect are not entirely pure or innocent as he presents. Trump campaigned in 2016 in favor of better relations with Russia but was convinced/coerced into continuing anti-Russian policies. Russiagate was powerful in this regard. So perhaps his turn toward Russia is another part of him doing everything that the permanent bureaucracy and the media stopped him from doing last time. For better or worse. Good observation on driving a wedge. But Brian Berletic, always a voice of sanity, believes this is anything but a rapprochement with Russia. He believes the US intends to continue the war but is trying to rework the division of labour. As always he is meticulous about backing himself up with sources direct from the parties themselves. Check out his post of two days ago with Angelo Giuliano, titled “Is There a Real US-EU Split?” Warning: it’s a long one – 2 hours. I trust Brian on military issues; on geopolitics, not so much. Experts such as Jeffrey Sachs differ with him, in major ways. This is ad hominem. You need to address the particulars of his argument and try to debunk that and not engage in a personal attack in lieu of a rebuttal. I’ve watched Brian’s podcast and his interviews here in BKK. He tends to become adamant about US “actions”. His military background is extensive enough but his grasp of geopolitics often seems naïve, rather idealistic. He often “protests too much”. Sounds good to me. Seems more to me that the Trump administration is trying to get Europe to take over the Russia Ukraine fight to free up the US to spend more resources on losing WW3 to China. The whole story of the rare earths (which Ukraine doesnt have) and other natural resources being committed to a $500 billion dollar fund seems like a way for the US to come back down the road and claim Russia is “stealing” things which the US has already rightly stolen for itself! EU leaders have flocked to Kiev today to announce their undying support. The Germans now seem determined to give Ukraine taurus missiles to fire directly into Russia. Starmer now ‘guarantees’ that Ukraine will join Nato. World War III to come? Only if Trump agrees to send US troops into the Ukraine which he does not want to do, no matter how many times countries like the UK and France try to trick him into it. If countries like the UK, France and Germany sent troops into the Ukraine, the Russians have already said that they would attack them which is why they won’t do it without total US backing. Numbers would be low in any case. I believe that with troop rotations in mind, that the UK has said that it can only send in a hodgepodge force of some 3,000 troops as part of such an effort so that is about a brigade’s worth. You couldn’t garrison a major city with a force that size. They would probably be outnumbered by the local police force. Thank you, John. The UK’s stuffed. Let’s get it over with. Northwood and High Wycombe are down the road. Perhaps a warning shot on Chequers first? Thank you. Good idea. I had some friends visiting over the weekend and showed them Chequers and Wotton. I’m sure the Russians have the GPS coordinates 51.74357064219684, -0.781010480432043 Do they seem determined to do so? (sending Taurus to Ukraine and launching them towards Russia). I though it was nothing but cheap talk by Merz moths ago. Not having warranted support from the US which in turn has stopped launching ATACMS i believe this will not happen. It would be extremely stupid given Europe is absolutely unprepared against Russian retaliatory attacks with whatever they have including the Oreshniks. It´s just filling empty space. I have seldom seen such a blowhard as Merz. Even worse than Scholz or even Habeck who has actually turned out to be a giantly dishonest asshole considering his insulting behaviour towards his own ministerial staff. I have got accustomed to a little trick – if you wanna know a politician´s true colours go back to their early years and look what they did and how. And you will mostly see a ridiculous, cowardly clown. At least Lindner is honest. He promised not to enter another coalition with the Greens and will do what he said How will the European public, which has largely soured on the war, react to more power going to Brussels and loads of debt in order to keep losing to the Russians? They are going to punish the establishment by voting for it again. And has the public really soured on the war? They seem to not like the economic repercussions of the war, but the war course itself remains popular. There is no innocent population that was forced to go down this path by a treasonous political elite. Most people actively want this, they are just bitching and moaning about the personal discomfort that follows from their own actions. What is clear from the German election result is that the country is still divided into east and west Germany. After the asset stripping of eastern Germany to profit the west, the far right moved into the area and started to blame foreigners for all their woes, rather than the real culprits which was the German state and German corporations. This suited the west because it diverted attention from the real cause so they colluded to support the lie of foreign workers and not corporate asset stripping. Thus east Germany became the new home for the fascists of west Germany, the type of politics that the east had banned because of its destructive divisive nature. Now Germany is divided between the far right and the not quite so far right, not because thy are supported but because the left has been so heavily infiltrated by the right (the Greens are now a pro war party). It is said that the turnout has been high at over 80% but the result is still fractured and the German election rules have left many parties marginalized and unable to campaign effectively (criticism of Israel can result in bans). What is clear is that this election leaves the country deeply split and the people strongly opposed to the state The final tally for BSW — the only voice in the center-to-left spectrum that opposes further German military support for Ukraine — is 4.972%, missing by only 14,000 of more than 49.6 million votes cast (82.5% turnout) to hit the 5% required to enter the Bundestag (good graphics and numbers freely available here). This is a tragedy. Had they made the mark, the probable center-right aggressively Russophobic minority government would be more difficult to achieve. The blind march to war is so disheartening. It feels like 1914 around here. A CDU/CSU coalition with SPD is natural given their convergence on the top policy agenda items. (The Greens fit quite well too.) Given the progress of AfD, would it make sense for the CDU/CSU to form an pact with the SPD for future elections? Where are my manners? Thank you, Conor, for this valuable summary. My comment was already in mod when it dawned on me. Thank you, Conor. Further to the dodgy grandfathers, how about AfD toff Beatrix von Storch’s. Beatrix von Storch You couldn´t make up a better name for a shady character in some spy B-movie. “Storch” of course meaning the bird stork. “Why not resurrect the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe?” Aha, Conor Gallagher, because the OSCE had found extensive violation of human rights in Ukraine — including torture chambers and disappearances. The OSCE had to tone down those unfortunate findings after it became necessary to prove that the Russians were just plain old crazy Asiatics. Meanwhile, going forward, the horizontal bar chart: Which founding / core country is not like the others, at all? Italy. The Italian bar contrasts strikingly with the bars for Poland and Germany, which are similar indeed. So you have two rather unsuccessful countries spoiling for a fight. As to the Denmark bar, something is rotten in Denmark. Let us pray that akvavit consumption drops. And Italy is going its own way, as I watch the news and read the papers. Everyone from well-established Giuseppe Conte and most Five Stars, plus Marco Tarquinio in the Partito Democratico, to commentators like Alessandro di Battista and supposed alt-right (but more of a populist anarchist) Pubble are pushing Italy in another direction. And then there’s the Pope Factor. No wonder Giorgia Meloni is at CPAC telling the Elect that Italy is for sale and for plunder. Long term, she’s short term. PS: Noting the AfD’s figures, and noting Linke’s resurrection, I am reminded of a map that I saw today of results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_German_federal_election#/media/File:2025_German_federal_election.svg This is what happens when the oh-so-rational Germans have economic integration (merge and purge) without considering social and political integration. The old East asserts itself. Bavaria is extremely conservative. Conserving what? The right to have illegitimate children? According to the Catholic Encyclopaedia, 14.01% of all births in Bavaria around 1890 were illegitimate, second to only Austria with 14.67%. Given her petite stature, she cannot possible see too far ahead… Some very high heels would be useful. Could get to be Putin’s height… Judging by the trajectory of the Sweden Democrats in Sweden, AfD will fill the following function: – say no to NATO until the vote when they immediately say yes. AfD will not help Germany to leave this destructive organization. – do not care about sovereignity because they voted yes to the defence agreement cooperation = surrender your territorial sovereignity. AfD will not tell the USA to deoccupy the country. – use immigrants as a scapegoat for all the ills in the country and attract voters with this argument – continue to inflict neoliberal pain on society to maintain and/or increase voter support because of immigrants causing all ills of the world – toe the lines of the zionist lobby and the US and neocons Goals stated to SD by a zionist lobbyist https://x.com/Johnpatrick500/status/1889794786959241408 2024 petitions from Sweden Democrats (SD) Petition from SD to the Swedish government to withdraw support to UNRWA https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/indraget-bistand-till-unrwa_hc02225/ Petition from SD to move the capital to Jerusalem https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/erkannande-av-jerusalem-som-israels-huvudstad_hb0259/ Petition from SD to cut all aid to Palestine https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/upphorande-av-bistand-till-palestina-och-en_hc02386/ Petition from SD to cut diplomatic relations with Palestine https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/diplomatiska-atgarder-efter-palestinskt-stod-till_hb111057/ These far-right parties are definitely completely detached from the idea of sovereignity. Larry Johnson put some pen to this too: Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), is a war hawk and is likely to push anti-Russian policies. Fortunately, with only 28% of the vote, he lacks a mandate to up the ante and risk war with Russia. The political fissures that divide the German people mean that their country, once considered a powerhouse in Europe, will become irrelevant. https://sonar21.com/german-election-results-signals-more-chaos-ahead/ It’s now been two decades since I last visited Europe, and I spent quite a bit of time there in the 80s and 90s: I longed to return, but now I’m thinking I’d rather keep my memories as they are. As a Romanian, I say that it cannot happen to nicer people. Prior to WWII, Germany forced Romania via the Vienna Dicktat to cede the Northern Transylvania to Hungary, which was the downpayment to have Hungary join in the coming fight against USSR (likely it was not in the small print, otherwise Hungary would have rather taken the chance to stay neutral and maybe get the Austrian treatment after war). Then, with the non-agression treaty with USSR, Germany winked-winked, nod-noded for USSR to take over Basarabia from Romania (and of course the free hands in the Baltic and Finland, which was to be just provisional). This ensured that Romania would join Germany in the attack against USSR in June 1941, to recover lost territory. And the attitude towards the genocide in the Occupied territories… It cannot happen with nicer people… I don’t think anyone in Eastern Europe is feeling sorry for the Germans. German ideological infections are highly resistant to rationality treatment. However, the national recovery from near death in 1945 was quite vigorous. We can only hope that the return of realism in Germany does not require a similar degree of suffering. Germany needs to pull the EU together and lead an independent foreign policy that establishes economic ties indifferent to U.S. geopolitical machinations. Thanks. Only one wrinkle I feel, overextending Russia will not. The 2019 RAND paper is lacking data and insight into the reality of Russian planning and conduct. In fact I would suggest it´s the other way around EU overextending especially with commitment on the Pacific frontline being expanded. The Russians have stepped up production of hypsersonic systems among others for this very reason. With current Zircon covering almost all of Europe. The entire arsenal is well known to readers here. And that´s just the tip of the iceberg. Almost none of what RAND suggested will work. And where it did with Syria, in the long run we will see how it actually plays out for the perpetrators of that mess. Besides by now Russia appears to have found a new base with Algeria. Not to speak of BRICS etc. But as I said last night, as Connor stresses above – there is noone in Germany in sight who admits this or would act according to it. Germany.is.doomed. I can only hope BSW will create a grassroots basis with doing streetworkers´ jobs to work up from there. Like the Communist Party did in the Autrian city of Graz. As of now they are “our last hope” to quote Princess Leia. And the massive swing voters movements are proof of how insecure people truly are. With China having the Russians´ back and Russia being self-sufficient on every possible level RAND was producing fairy-tales. Besides that report was based on data at least 6 years old. wow. That´s like a lightyear away. Thanks Conor for your essay on the “alternate reality” Germany lives in. The main topic of the election campaign was not – as someone with a glimpse of common sense would have guessed – the accelerated deindustrialization process bleeding Germanys industrial sector dry or the destruction of the – in former times – very reliable german energy system or the destructive proxy war fought in Ukraine costing hundred thousand of lives and billions of Euros but the stupid idea of firewalling the AfD (a party with roots in hayekian neoliberalism as well as national conservatism) out of the parliamentary process. With the “firewall” the entrenched interests of the established party cartel manages to keep away the AfD from the possibility of having immediate influence on government politics. The other party which could have been a threat for the existing party cartel – the left-conservative BSW – was smeared as “puppets of Putin” by the MSM and – to make things worse – undermined itself by agreeing to government coalitions with cartel parties in Thuringia and Brandenburg. Not only were economic questions sidelined during the election campaign, a huge part of the populace seems neither interested in economic policy nor informed about the dire straits the national economy is in. And in the short run there will be no change of this: The MSM – one of the main tools of the professional-managerial caste – is still very good at “manufacturing consent” and upholding the “alternate reality” Conor described so precisely. p.s. quick look into the 2019 RAND study and its initial verdict of the Russian military which I need not comment here further. Just looking into their quoted sources reveals how they are missing the crucial points albeit trying to not denigrate the enemy. Which with faux respect fed false hopes. What is most striking: how little Western – publicly available – studies have changed since. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3063.html “(…) The present-day Russian military is a capable, albeit uneven, fighting force. Its ground and air forces can dominate the country’s near abroad militarily, (…) The Kremlin also possesses a survivable strategic nuclear deterrent consisting of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-based ship-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and bombers with air-launched cruise missiles, along with a formidable arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons. Thanks to decades of sustained investment, Russia boasts advanced air defense capabilities. Compared with the United States (or the Soviet Union), Putin’s Russia has a limited ability to project force, but defeating it on its home turf would be extremely challenging and costly. Moreover, it maintains these capabilities with a defense budget comparable to that of several weaker military powers, (…) Western observers disagree over the level of Russian military leaders’ acceptance of such concepts as “hybrid warfare” and such proposals as “escalating to deescalate” with nuclear weapons, but the 2014 seizure of Crimea demonstrated the Russian military’s capability to wage an unconventional military campaign. (…) While much Russian military equipment still dates back to the Soviet period, Russia launched an ambitious modernization program at the beginning of the decade seeking to provide the military with “70 percent modern equipment by 2020.”18 While the post-Crimea budget crunch has forced the Kremlin to scale back these targets, generous funding in the early 2010s enabled substantial progress. (…) The Russian militaryindustrial complex has shown it can produce modern weapons, if only in relatively limited numbers. Certain systems favored by Russian decisionmakers have benefited from decades of sustained investment and are world class. The S-400 air-defense system and T-14 Armata tank are advanced systems with no U.S. counterpart, as is Russia’s family of mobile ground-based strategic nuclear launchers. (…) Much of Russia’s defense industry has been neglected since Soviet times and is in desperate need of capital modernization. Critical production facilities and suppliers are located in former Soviet republics that are now hostile to Russia, particularly Ukraine, necessitating costly substitution programs. Like the rest of the Russian economy, the military-industrial complex is afflicted by corruption, although this might not be particularly bad by Russian standards. Moreover, much of the defense industry is state-owned via large holding companies. Both Russian and Western critics often charge that isolation from market forces is a critical weakness of the Russian military-industrial complex, but it is far from clear that this presents a vulnerability that could be exploited by a cost-imposing strategy. Corrupt and inefficient as the Russian defense industry might be, the cost-control problems afflicting U.S. defense procurement are so large that the Russians are often highly competitive on a cost-comparison basis. Potential Vulnerabilities For all their strengths, the Russian military and defense industry still suffer from many vulnerabilities. Even though ground forces make up the bulk of the Russian military and are still using outdated equipment, the Russian defense budget deemphasizes them in comparison with other services. While the quality of the average Russian soldier and his equipment is improving, it still lags considerably behind U.S. standards. The need to recapitalize the defense industry and the inadequacy of available funds to do so have helped perpetuate these critical weaknesses. Such areas as surface shipbuilding are in parlous condition, contributing to an uneven modernization. Furthermore, the scientific and technical capital underlying Soviet military strength has atrophied, as have the human resources available to the Russian militaryindustrial complex. Finally, military spending has been more protected from the effects of Russia’s budget crisis than have other areas of the state budget, but it is likely only a matter of time before economic realities catch up with Moscow’s military ambitions. (…)” In fact the truth of how little they understood in 2019 (and apparently might still do to some extent) is buried in the very last 1,5 pages of the 277 page study. Even if not all assessments in the entire study are wrong they did regard Russia as a leightweight. With some horrible consequences to everyone but Russians. Implications and Recommendations for the US Army “(…) Ultimately, the task of “extending” Russia should not fall primarily to the U.S. Army or even the U.S. armed forces. Indeed, the most-promising ways to extend Russia—with the highest benefit, lowest risk, and greatest likelihood of success—probably fall in the economic and information domains rather in the military domain. Moreover, as this study has argued, Russia is not seeking military parity with the United States and might simply choose not to respond to some U.S. military actions (e.g., shifts in naval presence), while other U.S. military actions (e.g., posturing forces closer to Russia) could ultimately prove costlier to the United States than to Russia. Nonetheless, there are at least three major implications of this work for the U.S. Army. First, the Army should rebuild its expertise on all things Russian, including foreign area officers, linguists, and intelligence analysts. If Russia does indeed pose a long-term threat, then the U.S. Army needs to develop the human capital to engage in this strategic competition. Second, the Army should consider investing—and encouraging the other services to invest—more in the handful of capabilities (e.g., ATACMs, IFPC2, longer-range anti-air defense, and other systems designed to counter Russian A2AD capabilities) that could extend Russia. The U.S. Army also might consider spending some of its R&D resources on less mature, more futuristic systems (e.g., swarm unmanned aerial vehicles or remote ground vehicles). While these measures would likely be insufficient in and of themselves to extend Russia, they would benefit U.S. deterrence efforts and could augment a broader whole-of-government policy. Third, even if the U.S. Army is not directly involved in “extending Russia” per se, it will play a key role in mitigating the consequences. As already mentioned, all the measures to extend Russia incur some degree of risk. As a result, enhancing U.S. deterrence posture in Europe and increasing U.S. military capabilities (e.g., an enhanced Javelin or active protective systems for Army vehicles) might need to go hand-inhand with any move to extend Russia as a way of hedging against the possibility of tensions with Russia escalating into conflict. (…)” A key difference that is missing is the aspect of morale: it is very clear to Russian front-line fighters why they are there and what they a doing it for, where as aside from the remaining true-believing Azov troopers who are simply thrilled to be killing “orcs,” most Ukrainian troops would likely rather be elsewhere. I don’t have the stats, but I know that the USA forever wars helped demolish many a hundred, two hundred years family traditions of serving the nation by serving in the military. Many of the actual combat vets I’ve encountered from these seem pretty messy in the head and often have fairly high disability-ratings from the VA. I haven’t come across one yet who thinks “it was worth it.” Training will only carry one so far, and it’ll usually click on when SHTF, but over the longer-term motivation from fear alone will not carry one through– it becomes burn-out. What do our soldiers fight for, especially if there is no god, tradition is dead, and that those who run their country actually hate them? edit: I am seriously sorry, I seem to not learn that the correct spelling is CONOR!!! Not CONNOR as in Terminator´s LISA CONNOR. You probably mean Sarah Connor. ;) Thanks Conor for the excellent article. 🙏 Germany´s biggest alternative news site NACHDENKSEITEN seems pretty devastated. They have 3 articles alone today filled with the tune of the doomed. “The BSW’s election defeat – a political disaster” ““I don’t know any parties anymore…!” – or: Requiem for a country” “Peace is the big election loser” It is interesting though that Germany´s pro forma most influential evening news TAGESSCHAU writes: “Millions of votes not represented in the Bundestag – “A little more than one in seven votes in the Bundestag election went to a party that will not be represented in the next Bundestag. According to the results of the counting of all constituencies, around 13.9 percent voted for a party that failed to clear the five percent hurdle. That corresponds to around 6.9 million votes” Add to that 17% of non-voters. There is a lot of potential there for BSW. BERLINER ZEITUNG with a commentary on Habeck: German version https://archive.is/x2kV1 The end of Robert Habeck: His power was more important to him than his political ideals After the election, the Green Party member quickly found the culprit for his failure: Friedrich Merz. But that is not true. It was Habeck’s will to power. A commentary. by Anja Reich On the day of Robert Habeck’s defeat, one could once again experience what had caused him to fail. It was election Sunday, between 6 and 7 p.m., the first projections were in, the Greens were at 13.3 percent, later they slipped to 11.6 percent, far below the expectations of the man who had stood to become Chancellor for the Greens. In interviews, Habeck was asked about the reasons for the Greens’ poor performance, and he had – well – an interesting explanation: Friedrich Merz is to blame. His vote in the Bundestag with the AfD. Green sympathizers had wished that he would never speak to the CDU again, said Habeck with a concerned expression. But that was not possible for him, Habeck. Because: “I can’t do that. I’m polarized differently, we’re polarized differently.” And then he added: “In that respect, we are now victims of Friedrich Merz’s voting behavior.” Robert Habeck – a victim of the CDU? The Green candidate for chancellor – a victim of the CDU? Because he stood by Friedrich Merz in a difficult hour? Against his own conscience? Anyone who followed Habeck’s election campaign must have thought at this point that the Vice Chancellor was suffering from memory loss. Let us remember what really happened after the much-discussed decision on the “Influx Limitation Act” on the last day of January this year. The CDU had introduced the proposal for the law to the Bundestag, knowing full well that the AfD would also vote for it. But contrary to expectations, not only the SPD and the Greens voted against it, but also some members of the FDP and the Union. The law failed. And Robert Habeck ? Seemed to be in a good mood. He wanted to become Chancellor, to beat Merz; he had started the election campaign in November with this unrealistic goal. And it became more and more unrealistic. The CDU was at 30 percent in the polls, the Greens around 15. But now, after the vote with the AfD, people took to the streets, even former Chancellor Angela Merkel stabbed Friedrich Merz in the back, the churches protested against him, half the country, it seemed. Robert Habeck wanted to depose Friedrich Merz from his poll throne Habeck’s tone towards the CDU suddenly became harsh and relentless. He accused Merz of breaking taboos and breaking his word. “Not once, but twice. Not by accident, but on purpose. Against all warnings,” he shouted at a campaign event in Cologne. The CDU candidate had disqualified himself for office. Habeck even had his election campaign changed: “One person. One word” became “One word broken. Hundreds of thousands of people.”, “Word instead of word broken,” “Habeck instead of Merz.” Just a few hours after the Bundestag vote, Habeck’s anti-Merz ad was already appearing on Spiegel Online and other websites. Something was happening, he announced, “from the depths of the soul of the country.” He wanted to become chancellor, to topple Merz from his poll throne. That was Habeck’s mindset. And nothing else. But the Greens’ figures did not improve, and Habeck’s plan to beat Merz did not work. And again he changed his strategy, his tone, drafted a ten-point paper himself to limit migration, offered himself to Merz, and said on Markus Lanz about the CDU’s vote with the AfD: “Mistakes can be healed.” There is more that the SPD and CDU have in common than what divides them. If not chancellor, then at least minister in a government with Merz and Scholz. That was the new plan. And many of Habeck’s supporters must have realized by now: The former do-gooder, the Greens’ great hope from the last election campaign, seemed to be primarily concerned with one thing: himself, with his position. Having power was more important to him than political ideals. Habeck’s last hope was the success of the BSW – of all things That is the case with many politicians. But Habeck’s bad luck was that the Left, led by the young East German Heidi Reichinneck and the former Greenpeace activist Jan van Aken, showed that there was another way: the uncompromising fight against the right, the commitment to left-wing ideals and green politics. The Left’s poll ratings shot up. The Greens warned against voting for them. In vain. In the end, the Left were the winners and the Greens the losers. And Robert Habeck also lost his direct mandate in the Flensburg-Schleswig constituency – to the CDU candidate. His last hope was, of all things, the Sahra Wagenknecht coalition, which Habeck had accused of being “bought by Russia” during the state election campaign. If the BSW had received more than five percent, the CDU would have needed the Greens as well as the SPD for a coalition, and they would have taken on government responsibility – and Robert Habeck would probably have become a minister. But the BSW did not make it. The CDU does not need the Greens for the government. On Monday, Habeck announced that he no longer wanted to take on a leadership role. An end that seems almost symptomatic of a man who for a long time no longer seemed to know what he stood for – or against. In the end, he was not dependent on the outcome of his politics, but on a party he despised. Regarding that comment about some BSW members crying foul over the vote of Germans living abroad – as one of the members of that particular club I’ve seen a noticeable amount of anecdata from Germans mostly living in the US and Canada that their ballot documents didn’t arrive in time or at all. Apparently that’s not unusual based on comments from some members of a forum I’m on, but it seemed worse this time. The way voting works for Germans abroad is that you need to get in touch with the town you were last registered to vote in and they’re supposed to mail you the ballots. The excuse this time around was that the local election offices didn’t get the final candidate lists until very late and had to rush the ballots to the printer and out the door. Given how long it can take to get a letter from Germany to the US, I’m expecting that a fair number of people will have received their ballots too late to send them back in time or will get them after the election. Not that this is a massive surprise for me as I’ve lived about half my life outside Germany and I didn’t get the impression that the bureaucracy is set up to deal with their citizens living abroad very well, at least not during the last quarter century. Did I vote? No. I fell foul of a law that states that one has to petition the Bundeswahlleiter for permission to vote if one lived abroad for more than 25 years. That tends to take a while from what I heard (would’ve been my first time) and with the short notice for the election, it wasn’t even feasible to go through that process and have the documents sent out in time. In NJ you can vote from Europe by email (with a printed copy as backup). I am disheartened by BSW’s near miss from entering the Bundestag — Sarha Wagenknecht offered something otherwise missing from the German political scene. Instead it looks like more “radical centrism” and a continuation of the policy failures of the German political establishment. Where there is no vision, the people perish … I am disheartened as well. I reckon we’re not the only two. Wasn’t she regularly polling in the teens? It looks like the flashy new Linke’s youth scene drained Sarah’s support just in the last months. Very disappointing, but one can hope that the trad Left will become useful again. Following the #BSW hashtag on Twitter a bit, I also read people saying that in recent months die Linke had received a bunch of positive press, extra coverage which apparently was unusual. Just speculating, but no doubt this media campaign was designed to draw people away from the BSW. AfD is quite useful to the establishment centrists and to the oligarchs, as has been explained in comments above. BSW and any serious popular left movement is a threat. “…And yet the priority is more weapons to fund an unwinnable war and prevent the Russians from conquering Europe — a threat for which there is still no evidence and makes no sense if you spend ten seconds thinking about it. But on the plus side from the perspective of the European vultures, it provides cover to continue dismantling the welfare state and privatize everything from infrastructure to social services…” “…The US and Russia could work out some rapprochement, which some in Washington believe will help with other wars in the Middle East, as well as the looming confrontation with China….” And if no war with China materializes, all that money was thrown at “AI” hype which is nearly ALWAYS presented needing to be urgently adopted “becuase China.” Three years in, couldn’t understand then and can see consequences now. I cannot fathom why anyone would favor fighting a war you are going to lose. FWIW Macron arrived at the White House today. Trump did not receive him at the entrance. Adam Tooze – a few of the statistics are in English via FT Deutschland 2025 – A live (and complicated) democracy. https://substack.com/@adamtooze/p-157799674 p.s. Democracy? Well I guess you can spin it in any way. Who can fail to be charmed by Lord Bebo’s clip of the delightful Annalena’s expression of joy at finally achieving the goal her grandfather shared with the Mustache Man and for which he so bravely continued to fight for at the Oder even after Germany’s unconditional surrender? I hazard that it takes a real man, a prime example of pure blooded German manhood, to continue committing war crimes long after the war is over. He, too, was probably a vegetarian who never killed a living creature for food. Regarding Annalena Baerbock’s €700 billion (yes, euros) for Ukraine, that money really looks like its coming. I know some people consider this to be some Russian disinformation, so here is a link to a pro-Ukraine news site telling the story: https://united24media.com/latest-news/europe-eyes-unprecedented-eur700-billion-military-aid-plan-for-ukraine-5981 (though the site credits Berliner Zeitung as the source) It isn’t just the war that is in favor of this package. The military support package is about the same size as the €750 billion NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme, which was set up to help EU countries cope with the Covid pandemic, and was financed with EU common debt. The NGEU programme increased the EU debt from 50 billion to 300 billion, which not only made larger investments possible, but also made the EU a bigger player in the bond market. The NGEU programme will end in 2026, so the EU needs another similar package to maintain its economic influence. “Regarding Annalena Baerbock’s €700 billion (yes, euros) for Ukraine…” I thought this was sarcasm, but evidently a serious Western European proposal. To me, the reality would be self-destructive madness. On the hidden transformation of the German LEFT PARTY as the cause for its sudden “success”: German daily JUNGE WELT: https://archive.is/28kXW From: Issue of 25.02.2025 , page 3 / Focus 2025 federal election Left strengthens Western ties Triumphantly back: The Left Party owes its return to the Bundestag primarily to a change in preferences among the urban “progressive” electorate By Nico Popp If the Left Party’s 4.9 percent in the 2021 federal election marked the transition from the latent to the open party crisis, then the 8.8 percent (4.35 million votes) in the early federal election in 2025, or so it seems, represent its conclusion. Two months ago, after years of political and organizational decline and at three percent in the polls, still almost written off, the Left Party has managed a comeback that no one expected. No other party has made such gains in the election campaign, no other has gained so many members. The Left Party had actually based its election campaign on winning at least three direct mandates, because a second vote result of more than five percent was still considered almost unattainable at the turn of the year. In the end, the party won six constituencies directly, four of them in Berlin, where Die Linke was also the strongest force in terms of second votes with 19.9 percent. Co-party leader Ines Schwerdtner won the mandate in Berlin-Lichtenberg, Gregor Gysi in Treptow-Köpenick, Pascal Meiser in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Ferat Koçak in Neukölln. Neukölln is the first “western constituency” that the party has ever won. In the Berlin-Mitte and Berlin-Pankow constituencies, the Left Party candidates were only narrowly defeated by the Green candidates. The former Thuringian Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow won the Erfurt-Weimar-Weimarer Land II constituency, Sören Pellmann again won the Leipzig II constituency (the only Saxon constituency that did not go to the AfD). What happened here? Clearly, in the middle of the ongoing election campaign, a political constellation arose that was extremely favorable for the party, but which the party did not bring about itself. This constellation has resulted in considerable parts of the urban “progressive” electorate, who have voted for the Greens for decades (and in some cases for the SPD or Volt in the 2024 European elections), but who nevertheless steadfastly maintain the self-image of being “left,” making the transition to the Left Party – albeit only at the last minute and against the very specific background of the election campaign focusing on the interrelated issues of migration and dealing with the AfD. Pascal Meiser’s victory in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, which had long been considered a Green “model constituency,” is exemplary in this respect, and was not anticipated by anyone in the party just a week or two ago. This development is particularly striking when contrasted with the finding that the election campaign focused on social policy issues in the party’s old strongholds, the eastern German states or a former 50 percent constituency such as Marzahn-Hellersdorf, has not led to a return to previous highs. Here, the party has at best slightly improved on the comparatively poor result of 2021. The sudden and steep rise was driven by significant gains in the western German states (and especially in the big cities), where the party has recently performed disastrously. On Sunday, however, it also climbed above five percent in Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein, i.e. in large states that were previously considered particularly “difficult” for the party. The party was particularly successful here and elsewhere in constituencies with university towns, where the Greens have long been the main winners. In the Münster constituency, for example, Die Linke received an above-average 12.5 percent of the second vote (plus 7.5 percentage points), in Bonn 12.5 percent (plus seven), and in Freiburg 13.9 percent (plus seven). Overall, the individual state results of the Left Party in the West and in the East are no longer so far apart. This is a first in the party’s history, in which the success (or failure) in a federal election always depended on the result in the East German states and in which, even in the phase of the party’s initial successes, such as the 2009 federal election, the gap between the results in the West and the East was very large – not to mention the PDS years, when the votes were almost exclusively obtained in the East and repeated attempts to “expand” to the West failed. This chapter now seems to be finally closed – the former strongholds in the East are no longer there, but the party has prospects of approaching ten percent of the vote in the western German states under favorable conditions. The focus of the party’s voters and members has shifted to the West. With this election, the party apparatus has achieved two long-held goals: breaking into the “progressive” electorate of the Greens and SPD and at the same time reducing dependence on the old strongholds in the East. The attempt to stabilize this state of affairs by further forcing political and programmatic adjustments to the new clientele will not be long in coming. addendum to the article: Background: More crosses The early federal election has at least brought about a moderate repoliticization: the non-voter bloc, which had grown to almost a quarter of those eligible to vote in federal elections, has shrunk somewhat. 82.5 percent of those eligible to vote – 49.9 million – cast their vote this time (2021: 76.6 percent). This is the highest voter turnout since the GDR was incorporated into the Federal Republic in 1990. The lowest voter turnout was recorded on Sunday at 77.7 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, the highest at 84.5 percent in Bavaria. According to the preliminary results published by the Federal Returning Officer on Monday, the Union won the election. The CDU and CSU together received 28.6 percent of the second votes, while the AfD, which almost doubled its 2021 result, received 20.8 percent. They were followed by the SPD (16.4 percent), which fell by almost ten percentage points, Alliance 90/The Greens (11.6 percent) and the Left Party with 8.8 percent. The FDP, which played a key role in bringing about the end of the traffic light government in November 2024, is no longer a member of the Bundestag with 4.3 percent. It has lost about two-thirds of its 2021 vote share. The BSW, which entered the race for the first time in a federal election, narrowly failed to clear the five percent hurdle. On Monday, the Federal Returning Officer reported 4.972 percent of the vote (2.46 million votes) for the party; in the end, it was about 13,400 votes short. The party performed above average in eastern Germany – best with 11.2 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, where it also finished ahead of the Left Party (10.8 percent). The party also achieved double-digit results in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It is striking that the party only received 9.4 percent in Thuringia, where it had received 15.8 percent in the state elections in September 2024 – so entering a coalition with the CDU and SPD cost a lot of votes. Another key factor in the narrow failure was that the party remained below five percent everywhere in the west, with the exception of Saarland. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous federal state, 4.1 percent of voters voted for the BSW. In the Bundestag, which has shrunk to 630 seats as a result of the traffic light coalition’s “electoral reform”, the Union parties have 208 seats, the AfD 152, the SPD 120, the Greens 85 and The Left 64. In addition, there is a single representative from the SSW. Apart from the AfD, with which no party wants to work together, the Union, as the strongest force, only has a parliamentary majority with the SPD. Popps article analyzes the surge of the party “The Left” correctly: “considerable parts of the urban “progressive” electorate, who have voted for the Greens for decades (and in some cases for the SPD or Volt in the 2024 European elections), but who nevertheless steadfastly maintain the self-image of being “left,” making the transition to the Left Party”. Estimated 700.000 voters flocked from “The Greens” to “The left”. That means: it is a borrowed success. The “Left” abandoned their old working class base in exchange for the academic salon bourgeoisie. The latter tends to look for moral purity instead of material interests based on the respective position in the economic process. It is to expect that this “greened left” will act like “The Greens” and say yes to “project Ukraine”, to “no borders/no nations” and to the neoliberal-authoritarian EU. On election night a fried reminded me of the “demise” of the Kipping party wing. Later I realized that actually it is not the temporary past demise that is of interest but its partial fulfillment now. THIS was Kipping´s idea: sneak away GREEN voters to the LINKE. After GREENS betrayed their promises this project materialized with one smart move: They “woked” the LEFT without calling it that. Your email address will not be published.

Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images In the summer of 2024, I noted that the stock market was likely to move higher. However, the big tech leaders were seen as too extended and overvalued. This group was due for a correction. If the market was to move higher and the tech leaders were to correct, then other lagging stocks would have to start outperforming, which has been the case. Let us take a closer look. The relative strength of the equally-weighted NASDAQ versus the S&P 500 turned up in late December and remains strong. This indicates that the average stock in the NASDAQ 100 is stronger than the cap-weighted S&P 500. The big-cap tech stocks have been lagging while the smaller weights in the index have been rising. The result: Many more stocks are rising but the equities that have the greatest influence on the indices have lagged. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in 2024 in which only 25% of the stocks outperformed the S&P 500. Note the rising relative strength as denoted by the green line. The relative strength screen shows that within the NASDAQ 100, the big eight tech stocks are ranked from No. 6 (Netflix) to No. 75 (Microsoft). Here are the stocks in relative strength order with the cycles recommendations in parentheses: Netflix (hold) Meta Platforms (sell) Tesla (buy) Nvidia (sell) Amazon (sell) Apple (hold) Google (sell) Microsoft (cycle low in March) This monthly cycle graph explains the buy signal on Tesla. This accurate monthly cycle points to higher prices through 2025. Here is another graph that explains the sell opinion on Nvidia: This cycle peaked at the price high and points down though the year. The top five NASDAQ current relative performers are: 1. Palantir 2. Super Micro Systems 3. Axon 4. Atlassian 5. DoorDash Some of these stocks are extremely overbought and too risky to buy now. From these new leaders, here are two stocks that can be added to portfolios. Super Micro came down hard, and is now giving longer-term buy signals, supported by rising cycles. There are weekly buy signals and a very oversold monthly price. Atlassian features technical strength and a rising monthly cycle. Use the pullback in this cycle and any NASDAQ weakness to accumulate shares. The cycle rises from March to June.

Nvidia (NVDA+4.94%) stock advanced by more than 3% ahead of the AI chip giant’s scheduled release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close today. The shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO+5.00%) and Micron (MU+6.00%) also gained. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.68%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion, or 85 cents a share, for the period ended in January. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first-quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+0.89%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. So Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF+2.19%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Nobody’s honest. Scientists are not honest. And people usually believe that they are. That makes it worse. By honest I don’t mean that you only tell what’s true. But you make clear the entire situation. You make clear all the information that is required for somebody else who is intelligent to make up their mind” — Richard Feynman “The Unscientific Age”, The Meaning of It All (1998) Number of the Week: 29,000 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW will continue with questioning whether climate science is a physical science. TWTW begins with a discussion of omitting physical evidence by the UN IPCC. Then it discusses the importance of the Greenhouse Effect. TWTW discusses a report that Earth’s albedo is changing. Then it discusses a report by Ross McKitrick that some advocates of the so-called social cost of carbon omitted key evidence. A controversy at the Royal Society is discussed, followed by an essay by David Legates explaining why the vaunted Hydrogen Economy is not materializing. TWTW concludes with a discussion on the failure of the green energy transition. ********************* Is It Science? For years, organizations have used the term science to sanctify their political actions. Some of these organizations even have the term science in their names, others are government organizations funded with the intent for providing physical evidence for certain concerns, such as weather. Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous, but some, such as James Hansen, may deceive themselves. Others seek funding for advancement and to profit from it. But in physical science the ultimate and final judge, nature, is impartial. All ideas and theories must be tested against what nature reveals to us, physical evidence from observation and experiment. To SEPP this is what is meant by applying the scientific method. And those ideas and theories which fail to meet the test must be discarded. Unfortunately, a common practice among researchers who are less than scrupulous is omitting data (physical evidence) that contradicts the desired conclusion. As Stephen McIntyre has demonstrated repeatedly, this practice was common to the so-called hockey-stick. It was featured in the reports of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [particularly the Third Assessment Report (AR3 or TAR, 2001)]. [The cover of the TAR Synthesis Report: Summary for Policymakers has been altered in recent versions, however the hockey-stick style shape (of roughly stable temperatures between the year 1000 to 1900 then sharply increasing temperatures and projections thereafter to 2100) can be seen in Figure SPM-10b: Variations of the Earth’s surface temperature: years 1000 to 2100.] Click to access spm.pdf To call such reports “science” is misleading. It is not physical science and some of the findings are contradicted by physical evidence. The contradicting physical evidence is omitted in such reports. However, it is common practice in the political game called “science” to label such reports as “science” — without mentioning the omitted physical evidence. This game is commonly practiced in the US and Europe. The integrity of all of physical science is tarnished by such efforts. *********************** Importance of the Greenhouse Effect: The UN IPCC and its collaborators have condemned carbon dioxide by speculating about possible harmful effects of increasing carbon dioxide and its greenhouse effect. Their publications seldom mention the benefits of the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor, without which we probably would not have life on Earth. Nor do they mention the benefits of the secondary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, which is essential for providing carbohydrates, the food source for all complex plants and animals. Their publications omit any benefits of the greenhouse effect itself. Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth. Without them the land masses of Earth would become too cold at night to support life as we know it. Growing plants would freeze every night. To understand the importance of the greenhouse effect for life, one needs only to compare the temperatures on Mars with those on Earth. Mars is about 1.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth. Thus, the solar radiant energy hitting it is less intense. But Earth has an albedo (reflective power) of about 30% reflecting solar radiation back to space, primarily from clouds and ice. Mars has an average albedo of around 16% primarily from dust and the composition of its surface. The daily rotation of Mars is about 24 hours and 37 minutes, a little less than 40 minutes longer than that of Earth. But it is the temperature range at the equator that is interesting. At the equator on Earth, the average daytime temperature is about 31°C (88°F). The average nighttime temperature is about 23°C (73°F). Thus, the average temperature range between daytime and nighttime is about 8°C (15°F). [Note there are other estimates that tend to give a smaller range.] At the equator on Mars daytime temperatures are around 20°C (70°F); the average nighttime temperature is about minus 70 °C (-94°F). Obviously, such cold on Earth would kill growing plants. Furthermore, although the atmosphere on Mars is thin, it is about 95% carbon dioxide. So, the runaway greenhouse effect is not occurring. https://www.space.com/16907-what-is-the-temperature-of-mars.html Some researchers such Carl Sagan falsely assumed such an effect is occurring on Venus. The overwhelming amount of the atmosphere on Venus is greenhouse gases, and the atmospheric pressure is about 92 times that on earth. If we had Venus’s quantity of greenhouse gases, they would amount to: CO2, 89,000,000 ppm (in other words 89 times our atmosphere in-toto; sulfur dioxide (SO2), 13,800 ppm; H2O, 1840 ppm, carbon monoxide (CO) 1560 ppm; hydrogen chloride (HCl), 30 ppm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus The Greenhouse Effect is vital for life on Earth; without it the planet would be too cold to support life. Further, the two significant greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide along with sunlight for photosynthesis provide carbohydrates (simple sugars), the food source for all complex plants and animals. Thanks to modern technology, we are measuring the greenhouse effect in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Calculations of the greenhouse effect by van Wijngaarden and Happer using the HITRAN database agree well with measurements at various latitudes made by satellites. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer *********************** Earth’s Changing Albedo? In August, Geomatics published a paper by Ned Nikolov and Karl F. Zeller titled “Roles of Earth’s Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations.” The abstract states: “Past studies have reported a decreasing planetary albedo and an increasing absorption of solar radiation by Earth since the early 1980s, and especially since 2000. This should have contributed to the observed surface warming. However, the magnitude of such solar contribution is presently unknown, and the question of whether or not an enhanced uptake of shortwave energy by the planet represents positive feedback to an initial warming induced by rising greenhouse-gas concentrations has not conclusively been answered. The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also did not properly assess this issue. Here, we quantify the effect of the observed albedo decrease on Earth’s Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT) since 2000 using measurements by the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project and a novel climate-sensitivity model derived from independent NASA planetary data by employing objective rules of calculus. Our analysis revealed that the observed decrease of planetary albedo along with reported variations of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) explain 100% of the global warming trend and 83% of the GSAT interannual variability as documented by six satellite- and ground-based monitoring systems over the past 24 years. Changes in Earth’s cloud albedo emerged as the dominant driver of GSAT, while TSI only played a marginal role. The new climate sensitivity model also helped us analyze the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) calculated as a difference between absorbed shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Observations and model calculations revealed that EEI results from a quasi-adiabatic attenuation of surface energy fluxes traveling through a field of decreasing air pressure with altitude. In other words, the adiabatic dissipation of thermal kinetic energy in ascending air parcels gives rise to an apparent EEI, which does not represent “heat trapping” by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases as currently assumed. We provide numerical evidence that the observed EEI has been misinterpreted as a source of energy gain by the Earth system on multidecadal time scales.” [Boldface added] In other words, the increase in warming that has occurred since 2000 may be from a small decrease in cloudiness, not from an increase in CO2. The CERES project, designed to measure the earth’s energy imbalance by measuring solar intensity, albedo, and outgoing IR, concluded that the “Large ASR [Absorbed Solar Radiation] trend [is] primarily driven by reductions in low and middle clouds. (https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2023-05/15_Loeb Contributed_Science_Presentation_2023.pdf) As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. Further, John Robson discusses a paper by Swiss scientists suggesting sunlight hitting the earth is increasing, first from a reduction in Soviet era pollution, then from an overall decrease in cloudiness. [Robson did not link to the paper.] See links under Science: Is the Sun Rising? and Commentary: Is the Sun Rising? *********************** More Omissions: During the Biden Administration a group of economists decided to increase the mythical Social Cost of Carbon (Dioxide) (SCC). Econometrician Ross McKitrick examined their work and wrote a paper “Extended crop yield meta-analysis data do not support upward SCC revision” published by Nature, Scientific Reports. The abstract states: “The Biden Administration raised its Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimate about fivefold based in part on global crop yield decline projections estimated on a meta-analysis data base first published in 2014. The data set contains 1722 records, but half were missing at least one variable (usually the change in CO2) so only 862 were available for multivariate regression modeling. By re-examining the underlying sources, I was able to recover 360 records and increase the sample size to 1222. Reanalysis on the larger data set yields very different results. While the original smaller data set implies yield declines of all crop types even at low levels of warming, on the full data set global average yield changes are zero or positive even out to 5 °C warming.” [Boldface added] Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. had a post by McKitrick which explains his work in some detail. The background sections states: “In 2023 a team of economists working for the Biden Administration concluded the SCC needed to be increased by a considerable amount. The higher the SCC, the costlier the regulatory burden that can be justified by the agency. This not only affected US regulations but Canada’s as well since our own environment ministry adopted the new US values when justifying a sweeping set of new greenhouse gas regulations. I wrote an op-ed about the SCC change in May 2023 in which I drew attention to the important role played by a revision to projected agricultural yield damages. While it is difficult to trace where, precisely, all the changes came from, I estimate about $50 of an approximately $100 increase in the 2030 value of the SCC (holding the discount rate constant) was attributable to the revised agricultural yield damage estimates. These revisions were attributed to estimates of crop yield losses from a 2017 paper published in Nature Communications by Frances Moore et al. called “New science of climate change impacts on agriculture implies higher social cost of carbon.” I’ll call that paper M17. I was familiar with this paper because Kevin Dayaratna and I had studied it while preparing a response to a comment by Philip Meyer on a paper of ours on the SCC. I knew, for instance, that M17 used a data set originally developed for a 2014 paper published in Nature Climate Change by Andy Challinor et al. called “A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation.” I’ll refer to that one as C14. But C14 and M17 had different implications about the impact of CO2-induced warming on crop yields. In the C14 model CO2 fertilization offsets the damage from warming, whereas in M17 the combined effect is negative for most crops across most warming paths. So why the difference? It was not possible to tell simply by reading the papers. Neither one provided a detailed explanation of its regression analysis. M17, in particular, did not report its regression results nor was its model directly comparable to C14. So, in 2023 I decided to get the data and try to replicate both sets of findings. While both papers said the data was available online at a website called http://www.ag-impacts.org no such site currently exists, and the Wayback machine entries did not include any data. I emailed Moore to ask for her data, but she was at that time working for the Biden Administration and her university email was inactive. I then reached out to Challinor who replied promptly and sent me his data set.” McKitrick explains the misleading dataset he terms as C14. He then explains the slow review process in which his paper was rejected by Nature Climate Change and the slow review by Nature Scientific Reports. The paper was finally published by Nature Scientific Reports on February 15, after the new US administration took office. McKitrick states: “Of course, the topic has now been rendered somewhat moot by the Trump Administration’s January 20 Executive Order suspending the SCC on the grounds that it is “marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.” The EPA has until mid-March to issue guidance on how to address these problems including possibly scraping the use of the SCC altogether. I have had no contact with people working on that undertaking but if any of them were to ask me I would tell them the following. Measuring the SCC is not a scientific procedure akin to measuring the weight of an atom or the speed of light. The SCC is based on so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that contain countless assumptions and yield complicated “if-then” statements. If the following assumptions are true, then a ton of CO2 emissions will cause $X worth of damage to the world. Whoever gets to pick the “If” statements determine what the “then” statement will be. And you can pick studies that guarantee any SCC value you like, although some are more plausible than others. Ultimately the SCC is determined by the political and social process of choosing who gets to write the report. The Biden-era SCC report was written by people whose antennae were up for any reasons whatsoever to boost the SCC estimate, and who ignored evidence pointing in the other direction. The report even warns the reader that they probably overlooked many reasons why the SCC is even higher than they have estimated because surely there are many other damages associated with CO2 that they have not yet thought of. (They claimed to have taken account of the benefits associated with CO2 fertilization in one of their two IAMs, but they did so based on the M17 analysis. Which means, in effect, they didn’t take it into account.) From an economic perspective, the dirty little secret of climate policy is that CO2 emission reductions are so costly, even if the US government accepted the Biden SCC estimate very few climate policies would survive a cost-benefit test, and if the SCC were lowered to something more reasonable none of them would. So, in that sense climate activists will get no joy from hanging onto the SCC. But beyond the question of what the magic SCC number should be, the bigger question is how you convince a bureaucracy not to rig the report-writing process. The 2013 Interagency Working Group SCC report boasted of consulting 11 separate government agencies, and the 2023 report additionally boasted of input from the National Academies of Science and outside expert reviewers. Yawn. The more agencies involved the less scrutiny a report gets. It is all but certain that no one checked any underlying data or undertook any replication work. And I know from experience in the IPCC and other bureaucratic processes that review comments going against a chapter author’s biases are ignored or argued away, while comments confirming an author’s biases are welcomed at face value. The scientific establishment has resisted all attempts to fix climate assessment processes because they always got to pick the authors. But now a very different team is going to do the picking. If the establishment grandees suddenly decide they don’t like the process, they should have said something sooner.”[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy *********************** Which Science? Episodes such as the one experienced by McKitrick prompt one to ask: when organizations speak of science, what type of science are they referring to: Is it the science of using the scientific method to test all ideas against nature, or the science of omitting key physical evidence that contradicts the proposed idea or theory? The Royal Society is the oldest science society in the world. Elon Musk is a fellow. Jo Nova links to an article in the journal Nature which states; “The Royal Society in London has called a meeting to discuss the behavior of fellows after a growing campaign by scientists over the membership of Elon Musk. The meeting, scheduled for 3 March, comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow. Musk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programs and are causing havoc for scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social-media site X, which he owns. Two Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behavior in recent months. ‘It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honor of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?’ says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.” The Imperial College London harbors World Weather Attribution (WWA) which without physical evidence attributes severe weather events to increasing carbon dioxide. Further, Musk and his team are exposing significant funding of highly questionable political organizations in the name of science. The question is, which type of science are these members defending: the science that tests all ideas against physical evidence? or the “science” that omits key physical evidence to make a political assertion? Nova writes: “The Royal Society acts every day more and more like a trade union for approved priests of science. They reveal their small mindedness in so many ways. They accuse Musk of ‘attacking public sciences’ which begs the question of what a public science is? Is that different to real science? Or has the Royal Society totally forgotten that science is a process and not a government institution? The original full name of the Society was ‘The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge’ and no one on Earth is doing more to improve natural knowledge than Elon Musk is. And the reason he can do so much, so fast, is surely because he is funding it all himself, not waiting for government approval, appeasing bureaucrats, or cringing before ‘science’ committees with magical fashionable keywords like diversity. Musk should quit the Royal Society because it has forgotten what science is The Royal Society doesn’t know it, but they desperately need Elon Musk. The Royal Society has become nothing more than a workers’ union for government funded technicians dressed in lab coats, and he’s the greatest private scientist in the world today. He is the antidote to government funded paralysis in science (and in so many ways). Consensus ‘scientists’ are just a paid marketing wing of Big Government — captured by the monopolistic funding. The Royal Society needs Elon much more than Elon needs the Royal Society. He should quit now, before they hold their sanctimonious meeting. *UPDATE: Quitting? Nah. It only makes the Thought Police happy. Unless he has the time to excoriate them properly on the way out, it’s so much better to let them dig their own hole in public, then come crawling back when he gets to Mars. Besides, Elon has 218 million followers on X – If he wanted to set up a Society of Scientists — ones who care about the scientific method, he could do it tomorrow.” See links under Lowering Standards and Funding Issues. *********************** Failed Magic Fuel: SEPP director David Legates, and member of the Cornwall Alliance, has an essay on Master Resource “Hydrogen Energy: Not Clean, Green, Cheap.” He clearly explains the major problems involved in attempting to use hydrogen as a fuel. First, on Earth it is not a fuel. There are no hydrogen mines or fields that can be drilled. It must be extracted from H2O, natural gas (primarily CH4,) or other hydrogen compounds, at considerable cost in energy. There is significant energy loss involved in production. Second it is difficult to store because it turns most metals brittle. Third, it is difficult to transport. Fourth, it is difficult to use, it is extremely explosive. Legates concludes with: “Not Cheap Finally, the fourth hurdle should now be obvious. The use of hydrogen as a fuel source is expensive—in terms of production cost, expensive storage, and energy required to produce. Hydrogen as a fuel source will allow virtue signalers to claim they have developed and are using a ‘clean and green’ fuel source that is ‘saving the planet from the evils of fossil fuels.’ But in reality, it is only going to make energy more expensive and send a larger proportion of the planet back below the poverty line. As we have often stated here at the Cornwall Alliance, inexpensive energy has been the solution to raising billions of people above the poverty line and increasing their standard of living. Hydrogen energy will cease to become viable when the subsidies provided to it by governments of the world dry up. Hopefully, the new Administration will recognize that hydrogen embrittlement applies not just to metals, but to our economy as well.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Article #1 for the bankruptcy of the electric and hydrogen truck manufacturer Nikola. *********************** An Unraveling: Planning Engineer Russ Schussler has an essay in Climate Etc. which takes apart the erroneous thinking behind the failing green energy transition. He writes: “The purpose of this article is to summarize and debunk many of the issues in the narrative surrounding the proposed green energy transition as applies to the electric grid. The issues are so numerous that this piece is at once both too long and too short. A full unraveling deserves a book or series of books. This posting, however, challenges the narrative through summary comments with links to previous posts and articles which can be read for a more detailed explanation or for greater depth. The Narrative Efforts to hasten a ‘green transition’ find support in a powerful and compelling narrative. The following statements are widely believed, embraced and supported by various ‘experts’, a large part of the public and far too many policy makers: Schussler then debunks these claims. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *********************** Number of the Week: 29,000 According to the German newspaper DW translated into English: Germany has expanded wind and solar energy but failed to cut back on fossil fuel use in the transport sector. Environmental issues did not feature prominently in the election campaign — unlike the last time around. The head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz — who, according to the polls, is most likely to become the next German chancellor — has often said that Germany’s approximately 29,000 electricity-generating wind turbines are a thorn in his side. In November 2024, Merz told public broadcaster ZDF, “I even believe that if we do things right, we can one day dismantle the wind turbines again — because they are ugly.” When a high-pressure system settles over Northern Europe in the winter, producing cold, still nights; 29,000 turbines produce little electricity for Germany. When will the German public realize this? See link under The Political Games Continue. Science: Is the Sun Rising?

Feb 19, 2025 Recommendations for Reform of the U.S. National Climate Assessment By Patrick Brown, The Breakthrough Institute, Feb 19, 2025 [H/t Charles Rotter] 5. Conclusion The NCA can reform its current image as a political tool by presenting the total picture—considering both threats and opportunities, incorporating exposure and vulnerability into disaster cost analyses, leveraging systematic review methods, and communicating findings in an objective, data-centric manner. These reforms would not only make the report more useful but also allow it to be more robust to pendulum swings between administrations. [SEPP Comment: Under the current structure, it is doubtful that the United States Global Change Research Program’s (USGCRP) National Climate Assessment (NCA) is worth saving.

That’s apparent as the second Trump administration “floods the zone” with efforts to dismantle science agencies and the data and websites they use to communicate with the public. The targets range from public health and demographics to climate science. The Endangerment Finding Is in Danger. Will EPA’s Zeldin Uphold Climate Science? By Rachel Cleetus, Policy Director with the Climate and Energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists, Feb 18, 2025 If Lee Zeldin is looking for a recent authoritative assessment of the science, he should turn to the 2023 Fifth US National Climate Assessment, produced under the direction of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates that the USGCRP—which collaborates across 15 federal agencies—deliver a report to Congress and the President at least every four years. Another valuable source is the IPCC sixth assessment report, which reflects the work of thousands of scientists around the world—including many from the United States—in assessing the latest climate science, impacts, and opportunities to cut heat-trapping emissions and adapt to climate change.

Why is the US giving it billions of dollars? By Robert Bryce, His Blog, Feb 18, 2025 In 2013, the World Bank declared it would stop funding coal projects and would only “in rare circumstances” provide financial support for new coal plants. It also said it would “scale up efforts to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy.” Rather than support coal projects, the bank said it would “scale up its work helping countries develop national and regional markets for natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon intensity.” But two years later, the bank backtracked on natural gas and said it would stop all lending for oil and gas projects “except under exceptional circumstances.” Since then, the bank, which claims its “role is to reduce poverty by lending money to the governments of its poorer members to improve their economies and to improve the standard of living of their people,” has lost its collective mind.

Nuclear Energy and Fears NRC Proposes Deep Fee Cuts for Advanced Nuclear By Sonal Patel, Power Mag, Feb 20, 2025 Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind Space-Based Solar Power: The Future of 24/7 Clean Energy Generation By Aaron Larson, Power Mag, Feb 18, 2025 “Cal Tech has had a small endowment in this area and has been doing a lot of research. They did a very, very small-scale [demonstration] of actual power beaming from orbit down to the surface a couple years ago. And what we’re actually seeing right now is that in the next five years, we’re going to have the first on-orbit power-beaming demonstrations, again, focusing on lasers, because that’s where a lot of the DOD interest is right now, and that’s where the actual funding is. But we’re going to see that you’ll have those initial demonstrators, and if you start having a market, especially for space-to-space power beaming, that could happen a lot sooner than people think, because you don’t need to have very large systems for that. Just having several kilowatts would be really helpful for certain types of applications.” [SEPP Comment: A possible source of power that may prove to be very practical in areas with few clouds, but a bit impractical perhaps for planes or birds passing through the intense beams. In the 60s (?) the idea was to beam down microwaves at about 200 W/m2, roughly 5% of that of a microwave oven, and covering large areas where the microwaves would be efficiently absorbed by “rectennas.”] Solar Energy Is Not Competitive with Fossil Fuels By Norman Rogers, Real Clear Energy, Feb 18, 2025 The size of power plants is often expressed by the maximum number of megawatts of power they are capable of delivering, called the nameplate rating. The average power delivery is less. For a natural gas plant, it is possible to generate an average power of near 100 percent of the nameplate. The plant can run continuously except for maintenance pauses. But for a solar plant the maximum capacity factor is about 25 percent in sunny areas. The low-capacity factor of solar plants, that mainly work in the middle of the day, is the reason solar is so expensive.

Nikola’s EV Truck Dream Goes Bust Another green industrial-policy project enters Chapter 11. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Feb. 19, 2025 TWTW Summary: The editorial begins with: “Another green-energy unicorn died Wednesday as Nikola Corp., the electric-truck startup, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its spectacular market crash is another warning about the perils of industrial policy and chasing government subsidies. The 11-year-old EV maker aspired to be the Tesla of trucks. Nikola went public in June 2020 through a blank-check merger amid the euphoric pandemic stock-market recovery and Democratic promises of a Green New Deal. It fetched a $27 billion market valuation that at the time was greater than Ford’s even though Nikola had sold no vehicles. Supposedly sophisticated investors were taken in by its marketing hype. General Motors announced on Sept. 8, 2020, that it was taking an 11% stake in Nikola, which CEO Mary Barra hailed as an “industry leading disrupter.” It was disruptive in a different way. In January 2018 Nikola posted a video on Twitter of its model truck appearing to power effortlessly down a flat road with the caption: “The Nikola Hydrogen Electric trucks will take on any semi-truck and outperform them in every category; weight, acceleration, stopping, safety and features—all with 500-1,000-mile range!” That would be a revolutionary—if true. It wasn’t. According to a 2021 federal fraud indictment of founder Trevor Milton, an inoperable prototype was towed to the top of a hill. Then Nikola employees released the brakes so it looked like it was cruising along. All the while the door was taped shut to keep it from falling off, and its batteries were removed to prevent the truck from catching fire. After taking investors for a ride, Mr. Milton was convicted in 2022. Nikola’s marketing deceptions and problems spooked investors. Nikola in 2023 recalled 209 battery-electric trucks owing to fires. As of last October, it had sold fewer than 500 trucks—and at a heavy loss. Nikola reportedly had sold hydrogen trucks for $351,000 — about half what it cost to produce them, though its sales price was still about twice as much as an internal-combustion-engine semi. This was financially unsustainable, especially amid higher interest rates. California regulators and the Biden Administration tried to boost the electric-truck market with mandates and subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a $40,000 tax credit for buyers of electric trucks. An Environmental Protection Agency rule last spring requires that electric models make up 25% of long-haul tractor sales by 2032. But the government still couldn’t induce truckers to buy them. “Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” Nikola CEO Stephen Girsky said on Wednesday. Translation: High costs and technological limitations make EVs impractical for long-distance trucking operations.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Despite the tanking of the economy by divers means, mainly taxation, some are still prepared to engage in blatant doublethink. Recently Guido had this: “Rachel Reeves has been warned she must “urgently” boost the economy after her tax hikes triggered the sharpest collapse in business output and profits since the pandemic. A damning report from the CBI predicts another significant fall in private sector activity over the next three months (-23%), with the “pessimism widespread” https://order-order.com/2025/01/27/british-businesses-sees-biggest-hit-to-profit-and-output-since-covid/ That same CBI says… “Britain’s net zero economy is booming, CBI says Green sector growing at triple the rate of the UK economy, providing high-wage jobs and increasing energy security … The analysis showed economic growth and climate action go together, said the report’s authors, and improve lives and livelihoods. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/britain-net-zero-economy-booming-cbi-green-sector-jobs-energy-security On the one hand an economy going into needless recession and on the other a boom in green… To quote Rachel from Accounts: “There is no tradeoff between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century” And to quote John Lennon: “Just gimme some truth”. “Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous” I’m not this is true (any more). At every level they are encouraged to be less than truthful. This starts with funding proposals, in which they feel compelled to exaggerate, often wildly, the significance and impact of what they propose. The buzzwords change constantly, eg “paradigm shifting” becomes so yesterday and is replaced by “transformative” or some other vacuous term. The publication process has become a game. It is not to be taken seriously. It’s difficult to get informed, balanced, intelligent reviews any more in most journals, especially the interdisciplinary journals. Reviewers are often antagonistic for no reason, frequently ignorant of the techniques employed, and unable to judge the merits or spot fundamental flaws. This makes the process somewhat of a lottery, with of course some biases. Editors don’t by and large make editorial decisions any longer. They hide behind reviewers without bothering to make sense of comments and responses themselves. With the right recipe in terms of topic, techniques and writing style, it’s perfectly possible to get papers into top journals often by simply bamboozling reviewers with technical jargon and exaggerated claims. Just keep submitting and some will slip through. If you look more closely, you will find most papers suffer from outright fakery or data manipulation, or lies by omission. For example, there are countless papers in so called top journals like Nature using machine learning, especially deep learning, in which it is obvious that the authors don’t understand the techniques, have applied them to ill suited problems, and have misinterpreted or manipulated the results. This sort of thing would be resoundingly mocked by a specialist journal as an example of what not to do. Do the authors know what they’re doing? Of course they do. The PhDs, postdocs and supervisors are all aware that they shouldn’t be using techniques they don’t fully understand, but they do it anyway to ride the the latest fashion. By the way, I don’t blame the junior ones too much, this is the culture in which they’ve been trained and come of age . This is the sort of dishonesty that is most common, and it is rife. The more serious dishonesty (plagiarism, fake data) is much rarer. The entire academic system from the focus on funding over scholarship to the corruption of journals and scientific bodies will not be easily fixed. I don’t see how it can be. Academia has attracted and awarded the wrong sort of person in the past 20 years or more. The non scholar, a natural manager rather than a researcher. These types are in charge of universities, journals editorial boards and scientific panels and bodies. These people got to where they are by focusing on the things universities value (money), moving in the right circles, timing their bandwagon jumping to perfection and by exploiting the talents of others. They have redifined what it is to be a scientist to some degree. Doing research yourself has become anathema, a waste of your valuable time, which ought to be spent polishing the funding proposal written by your postdoc. I find endeavours like retractionwatch a bit laughable. They focus on one symptom of the disease, ignoring the root cause, and manage to catch a few small fry Indians and Chinese who are playing the game devised by people operating in a different stratosphere, occasionally catching out some big names Moreover, they engage in the same sort of censorship of views that don’t fit within the consensus. At heart, they are just another parasitic organisation set up to get whatever riches they can extract can from modern day ‘science’ Vert astute observations Abbas. 🙂 When did university media departments start acting as the critical influence on research projects, results and publication? It seems to me that media releases are orchestrated even before the print on abstracts is dry these days. I don’t think that happens to be honest. They are reactive, any good news will be exploited for maximum publicity, but they play no part in the publication process. A lot of it is self promotion, driven by the academics themselves, especially on social media. Horribly narcissistic Self promotion and marketing yourself can be key to fast promotion. This is the modern way. You don’t say as a young academic I want to solve X and Y outstanding problems in my area. You pick a fashionable topic, put some spin on it to make it sound novel then aggressively market yourself internally and externally as some world leader in this thing This transparently shameless tactic can get you known by senior management – they just love this kind of thing. Combine this with good funding success and you’re on your way to fast promotion before you’ve even learned to tie your shoelaces as far as the actual research is concerned. These days it’s not good enough to be good at research and well respected in your field. It’s not easy for senior management to see that. You need a ‘vision’. Visions are things I have in my sleep, or if I were to hallucinate on acid. Real research is not needed when you have a vision. The idea goes like this. First pick the journals in which you want to publish. Then pick suitable topics and techniques. Then find some idea and keep polishing it until your turd looks like gold, and you make sure to keep repeating that it’s gold, a new kind of special gold never before discovered, more golden and shiny than conventional gold. Submit. Get all your PhDs doing this. Let them learn from each other In the old days we picked the challenges we wanted to work on, rather than the journals we wanted to publish in. People tended to publish in more specialised journals. You couldn’t bs, couldn’t bamboozle. The reviewers were experts and you couldn’t fool them all. Yes, people made claims to big up their research, but this was done in a measured way. Nobody was claiming to have revolutionised anything, unless they really did “Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth.” I’m willing to bet you can’t quote Tyndall referring to “greenhouse gases” – because he didn’t. Tyndall pointed out that without an atmosphere, plant life (and hence human life) would not be able to survive the low nighttime temperatures which would occur. Conversely, daytime maximum surface temperatures would exceed the boiling point of water. Just like the Moon! Tyndall was never silly enough to claim that increasing the amount of CO2 in air would increase the temperature. I suggest anyone who thinks I am wrong, to read “Heat – a mode of motion”, which Tyndall continuously revised after each addition, as his knowledge increased. I continue to be surprised at some of the ideas attributed to John Tyndall which are contradicted by what he wrote. But hey, others know what Tyndall thought, better than his thoughts expressed in his written work. I only know what he wrote. That’s enough for me. I’ve asked this before but I think it warrants repeating. Am I missing something with regard to the use of hydrogen as a fuel/ As I understand it, the by-product of burning hydrogen is water vapour, which apparently is a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. if that’s the case (and you believe that greenhouse gasses are responsible for global warming), then what is the rationale for burning hydrogen in the first place? Alan, you’re right of course: But the UN agenda is to control the energy so to direct societies toward “progressive” ends. So it’s all about accounting for reductions in CO2 and CH4. It’s worse. Steam reformation I believe is still the only way to produce hydrogen at scale. 27% CO2 or something. The puny bits of so called green hydrogen, eg from concentrated solar, are probably not worth the effort when taking into account the whole process involved in production and transportation. Do not try to make sense of it, this would be a mistake. For goodness sake we now even have a war on nitrogen The primary source of atmospheric water vapor is evaporation from surface water which covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface. Any added contribution from human activity is trivial. Since water vapor continually condenses and evaporates at rates controlled by temperature and pressure to try and maintain a local quasi-equilibrium, the effect of any added water vapor on atmospheric concentration is not predictable. As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. You don’t say? Scientists discover unexpected decline in global ocean evaporation amid rising sea temperatures While the decreasing trend in ocean evaporation may seem counterintuitive in the context of global warming, it highlights the complexity of Earth’s climate system and the intricate feedback mechanisms that govern the planet’s hydrological processes. It sure does sound counterintuitive with the global boiling narrative but it depends on the Fruitloops giving the feedback and blowing wind up my ass that they’ve got a handle on all that settled science.

Meta said that the increase aims to bring executive compensation in line with other major technology firms. It’s worth pointing out that Meta announced an increase in executive bonuses soon after it laid off nearly 3,600 employees, which is around five percent of its total workforce. Furthermore, the company has also decided to reduce its annual distribution of stock options for thousands of its regular employees. Under the new plan, Meta executives will earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary in 2025, which is a massive jump from 75 percent last year. A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change in bonuses on February 13th, on the grounds that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of target total compensation of executives holding similar positions” at rival companies. The social media giant has increased these bonuses while it is in the process of laying off five percent of its global workforce. This is despite the fact that Meta’s shares were nearly 50 percent higher over the past year, with a current stock price of nearly around $687 per share. Furthermore, the company recently announced that its fourth-quarter revenue increased 21 percent year-on-year to more than $48 billion. It’s worth mentioning that Meta has cut more than 20,000 jobs in the past few years. While Meta executives will enjoy their fat bonuses this year, the company’s regular employees will suffer. The company has slashed its annual distribution of stock options by roughly around 10 percent for its regular employees, reports The Financial Times. The exact reduction in the stock options could differ depending on where the employees are located and what their roles are in the organization. That said, the new bonus and stock plans will take effect from the 2025 performance cycle. As per a filing, the new bonus plan doesn’t apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, he doesn’t have to worry about his bottom line as he’s worth nearly $250 billion. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Alibaba is going all in on trying to beat the US at developing AI that can reason like a human being

Hot stock Alibaba has set its sights beyond AI to focus on artificial general intelligence, or AGI. "We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence," said Eddie Wu, Alibaba's CEO, on Thursday. He called the pursuit of AGI the company's "first and foremost goal." AGI is AI technology that mimics human intelligence to the point that it can achieve complex cognitive tasks involving logic and reasoning. US-based companies working toward AGI include OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Masayoshi Son, the CEO of major AI investor SoftBank, said earlier this month that he expects AGI to arrive "much earlier" than his late-2024 forecast of two to three years. Wu's statement came after Alibaba released blockbuster results on Thursday. For the quarter ending in December, Alibaba posted an 8% rise in revenue to 280.2 billion yuan, or $38.6 billion. Profit rose to 48.9 billion yuan, beating analysts' expectations. "The pursuit of AGI can contribute immense business value," said Wu, citing studies indicating that AGI — when achieved — could replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities. He said about 50% of global GDP comes from wages for blue- and white-collar work. "If AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of the restructuring industry around the world. It could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP," he said. On Monday, Alibaba announced that it's planning to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. The company is in a crowded global race for AI supremacy as US tech giants ramp up their AI spending. According to recent earnings reports, the combined capital expenditures of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025. Amazon is leading the charge, with over $100 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year. The vast majority will go toward expanding Amazon Web Services and scaling AI infrastructure, the company said. However, the dramatic rise of DeepSeek, which released a new cost-competitive AI model last month, has thrown Chinese tech companies into the spotlight and caused investors to question whether massive Big Tech AI investments are justified. US-listed Alibaba shares are up 70% this year to date, thanks to the boost from DeepSeek and after Alibaba announced that it was working with Apple to incorporate its AI into iPhones in China. The upswing marks a major turnaround after Beijing's yearslong Big Tech regulatory crackdown, when cofounder Jack Ma's tech empire came under intense scrutiny. Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the country's top tech leaders — including Ma — in a sign that the country's private sector is now back in favor again. The market is viewing the meeting as a possible end of the crackdown. The Chinese government is seemingly working to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns, and a real estate crisis, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note last week following the event. On Monday, Hong Kong-listed Alibaba shares were 2.5% lower by midday after recent gains and as Asian stocks were broadly pressured by sharp losses in the US markets on Friday. Jump to

Title: Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? - The Pragmatic Engineer
URL: https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover topics related to Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. This article is an excerpt from last week's The Pulse, issue – full subscribers received the below details seven days ago. To get articles like this in your inbox, subscribe here. Many subscribers expense the newsletter – if you have a learning & development budget, here's an email you could send to your manager. Before we start: despite the below stats, the tech market is not all gloom and doom! This week, we covered pockets of the tech industry that are seeing more demand than before in the issue State of the startup and scaleup hiring markets – as seen by recruiters. Interesting data from jobs site Indeed shows the change in the number of active software developer job listings on the site. For context, Indeed is the largest job aggregator portal in the US and in several countries, and it crawls vacancies on other sites, too. This means that Indeed aims to track most of the posted jobs across a given region (via crawling and processing them) – not just the ones companies pay to post on Indeed. The overall picture looks pretty grim, right now: Since February 2020, Indeed has shared aggregated statistics on the number of active jobs listings, taking January 2020 to be 100%, as a reference. Facts about software developer jobs on Indeed: Indeed tracks international job markets, too. Canada has virtually the same graph as the US. Things are different in the UK, France, Germany, and Australia: Trends look similar across the world. Australia’s growth in software engineer positions is eye-catching because it’s higher, and it’s the only country where the number of jobs listed is not lower than in 2020. Section 174 — the accounting change effective from 2023, mandating software engineering costs to be amortised over 5 years is most likely to result in fewer software developer jobs in the US, as we have previously analyzed. The drop in jobs somewhat lines up with when this change became effective. However, Section 174 only impacts the US and US-headquarters companies. its impact would only be visible from early 2024 — and the drop since 2022 can in no way be attributed to it. Section 174 changes also do not explain why countries the UK and France see a similar drop in job postings. This suggests that although Section 174 changes in the US surely have an impact: this accounting rule change is not the main driver of this drop. What about the number of total jobs in other industries? The data: Across Indeed, 10% more jobs are listed today in February 2025 than were in February 2020. There are 35% fewer listings for software developers. Let’s dig a little deeper into which other industries are also experiencing a drop: The change in the number of listings in 2025, compared to 2020, for each of these areas: Hospitality and tourism openings are also down by 18%. Overall, software developer jobs have seen the biggest boom and bust in vacancies. No other segment saw hiring more than double in 2022; only banking came close. At the same time, hiring has fallen faster in software development in the last 2-3 years than anywhere else So, which areas have grown since 2020? Several sectors saw job listings go up, significantly: Growth rates compared to five years ago: The numbers don’t lie, job listings for devs have plummeted. There’s a few potential reasons why: Interest rate changes explain most of the drop. The end of zero percent interest rates is a mega-trend that affects many things across the economy since 2022, including hiring, the steep fall in VC funding, and how many tech startups survive, thrive, or die. But it doesn’t explain why highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon or Google have slowed down their hiring, or the large layoffs in recent years at tech’s biggest workplaces. The tech sector seems to react to sudden events with more intensity than any other industry. There is no other industry that started to hire in the frenzy than the tech industry did in 2022 – and then no other industry cut back hiring in 2024-2025. Let’s compare it with the industry that had the second-largest hiring boom during COVID: banking and finance. The job posting slowdown could partially be explained by how much more tech companies hired during the pandemic-era boom, and that companies are well-staffed thanks to that boom. Of course, we cannot deny that developer jobs – as well as banking jobs – are underperforming, compared to job listings across the economy: GenAI impact – yay or nay? We know first-hand that coding is an area in which Large Language Models are really helpful. Indeed, would it be so surprising if coding goes on to become the single best area of all that LLMs thrive in? The discipline looks tailor-made for it: Could tech companies be hiring less thanks to anticipating productivity boost that GenAI tools could bring for existing engineers? I don’t really buy this logic: but I can see how several companies could do a “wait and see” approach, slowing down hiring or even pausing it while they gather more data. A perception that engineering is no longer a bottleneck could be a reason for lower hiring. As covered in January, Salesforce will keep software engineering headcount flat because it’s seen a 30% productivity gain from AI tools. Salesforce has an interest in making AI productivity sound compelling because it sells an AI offering called Agentforce, and the company can afford to hire 1,000 additional salespeople to sell its new products it’s built. This suggests there’s substance in the reported productivity gain; Salesforce might be building software faster than it can sell it. Playing the devil’s advocate, this also raises the possibility that Salesforce isn’t building the right products, if it needs to hire more agents to sell its products, despite already having a strong distribution network and partnerships. Still too many engineers, after overrecruitment in 2021-2022? The period was the hottest tech jobs market of all time, and companies hired at a record pace. In 2023, widespread layoffs followed. Sluggish hiring today could be an indicator that companies still have enough “excess hires” from 2022. Perhaps some companies feel they hired too quickly before, and are going slower now. Are smaller teams more efficient? The two companies below hire slowly, and have small engineering teams: Could we be approaching the point at which building products is simpler to do for one or two engineers? Not because of LLMs, but how languages like Typescript allow working across the backend and frontend (using e.g. Node.js on the backend and React and React Native on the frontend and web). Of course, LLMs make onboarding to different stacks easier than ever. Consider how Indeed job postings will not be fully accurate data. There is a fair chance that Indeed is becoming less popular as a destination to post jobs – especially software engineering jobs – and that Indeed is either not crawling, or banned from crawling them. For example, Indeed lists a total of 663 jobs from Microsoft – however, Microsoft has more than 1,000 jobs just with the words “software” in them listed. I also struggled to find several startup jobs advertised on sites like Workatastartup (the job board for Y Combinator companies) listed on Indeed. I suspect that Indeed’s data should be directionally correct, and there are indeed fewer developer job listings than before. But I don’t think this data is representative enough of startup hiring, and it probably doesn’t track Big Tech hiring all that well either. Data shows that in 2023, the number of software engineers dropped for the first time in 20 years, fuelled by layoffs. It’s predicted that growth in the tech industry is likely to be low this year, and most certainly well below growth between 2011-2021 growth. I see a few possibilities: Smaller engineering teams get more productive. This is the optimistic outlook, where LLMs add a big boost to both individual and team productivity, which leads to more engineering teams being spun up, across the industry. More startups could be founded, and traditional companies could bring development in-house. The industry stagnates / shrinks. In this pessimistic outlook, even as software becomes cheaper to produce with fewer engineers needed, companies produce the same software, but with fewer people. This also assume entrepreneurs will not jump at the opportunity to build their ideas more efficiently – and much cheaper than before! I cannot see the scenario of the shrinking industry playing out – not with good software missing from so many parts of the world, and building better software being a big business opportunity in some many other industries. LLMs make software development more accessible for non-developers: I’m sure that LLMs are a leading cause of the fall in software developer job postings: there’s uncertainty at large companies about whether to hire as fast as previously, given the productivity hype around AI tooling, and businesses are opting to “wait and see” by slowing down recruitment, as a result. Startups are finding that smaller teams are working fine, and that it pays off to hire slower – as Linear and Bluesky are doing – and to avoid the “hyperscaling” approach of hiring first and asking what the new workers will actually do, later. Big Tech will hire slower than before, and I don’t see startups speeding up hiring. What’s missing is an answer to the question: how much new software will be created by non-developers using AI tools, for which a lot more developers will be needed to grow and maintain those new solutions?

Some elections are hard to fathom. Amid a wave migrant attacks, greenie energy devastation costing the country its global competitiveness, and a surge of populist conservative victories from political upstarts elsewhere -- in Italy, Netherlands, and other parts of Europe, as well as the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, Germany opted for the same-old stale conservatives who brought them to the state of where they are. According to NBC News: BERLIN — Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration. Merz is very much a globalist: GERMANY - The Globalists win again. New chancellor Friedrich Merz is their perfect pick. âªï¸Ex Chairman of Blackrock Germany âªï¸Dedicated to deeper EU integration âªï¸member of the WEF’s Board of Trustees âªï¸ regular atendee WEF in Davos âªï¸attended Bilderberg Group meetings… pic.twitter.com/kkG3hPwTfw — Bernie (@Artemisfornow) February 24, 2025 Sure, they threw a nest of leftist vipers out, which I suppose is an improvement. The far-left SPD trashed Germany's energy production in the name of going green, mismanaged the country's economy, spent up a storm, left Germany a military weakling, and opened the country's borders to the absolute bottom of the barrel in illegal immigrants, enforcing no laws against them, which has led to a string of terror attacks and a sea of crimes. presumably, the CDU/CSU, led by the inexperienced and unfortunately named Friedrich Merz (can we call you 'Fred'?), will hopefully clean up at least some of that. And on the bright side, NBC News described the results as "causing dismay," forgetting that every election has a winner and a loser and one of them is going to be unhappy. But the upstart AfD should have won, not the stodgy CDU/CSU, if Germany were ride the world's populist trend. Call me impatient, but they should have won. They could have joined the Trump-like nations, brought back law and order, thrown the illegals out, ended green nonsense, and restored their nation's greatness. Their moment seemed to be now, but they didn't win. Sure, they made gains, but they didn't win. How many times have we heard this kind of story in Europe? Germany just held their election. They require photo ID and use paper ballots. They hand-count the votes of each station one by one. No electronic voting machines due to security concerns. 50 million votes. It was all done in 8 hours. pic.twitter.com/542MgrGVXX — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) February 24, 2025 Worse still, Merz has stated that he plans to form a coalition with the outgoing SPD leftists, the third-place finishers who took 18% of the vote, their worst result in decades, bypassing the AfD because he considers them basically Nazis, ignoring that Nazis carried 'socialism' right there in their name as well as game. That pretty well means the socialists will be calling the shots, given the experience we know here in the states of RINOs aligning with leftists. They all go leftist when that happens. The AfD will be completely shut out of power, much as France's upstart party led by Marine Le Pen got that number pulled on them a couple years earlier. For us, the Germans will probably be a pain in the keister, with Merz stating he will distance himself from the U.S. If that means Germany pays its NATO bills and adopts a responsible energy policy, we can salute them anyway. If that means Germany gets rid of its open immigration and at least repatriates criminals, even better. But more likely, they will just obstruct the U.S. in the name of consensus or what the U.N. wants, making themselves a drag on the alliance. Elon Musk, who loudly supported AfD, noted that it was young people, particularly in the battered east, who supported AfD in the greatest numbers, meaning, the picture isn't entirely bleak -- the young people will continue to build strength for this party as the older, more cautious, generation dies off. As Rich Baehr has noted, movements take time to build strength and compared to the last election, this was impressive. The layered building of this party is continuing, much as has been seen elsewhere, because up until now, they were nowhere on the map. If the momentum continues, they will eventually win. But oh, it's so disappointing to see that, as Thomas Lifson once told us, the Germans "just want to be nice people." That seems to be the dynamic here, and one can only hope that for Germany, it's not too late to change course and become the dynamic nation they ought to be.

Title: An action plan for net-zero compatible with budget constraints
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/An-action-plan-for-net-zero-compatible-with-budget-contraints
Time Published: 2025-02-24T04:00:00Z

VLRS - stock.adobe.com When it comes to IT sustainability, the present economic uncertainty and political swings from diametrically opposite policies regarding climate change present a significant challenge to IT leaders. They require a technology roadmap to navigate these turbulent times robust enough to adapt to economic and political volatility. Sujata Kukreja, general counsel and chief compliance officer at network management platform Expereo, urges tech leaders to manage sustainability with innovation and take into consideration the running costs of inefficient datacentres. “We have to invest money and we are very conscious of datacentre energy consumption,” she says. Expereo therefore continues to prioritise emissions reduction, even if it’s costly. The procurement team increasingly seeks renewables-based arrangements. It’s about having a longer-term focus, especially with artificial intelligence (AI) tools coming in, says Kukreja. “But our investors are not going to continue if we’re not a business with purpose.” Another company that expects to continue to focus on emissions reduction and science-based targets despite economic pressures worsening in the past year is Crown Worldwide. Chris Davis-Pipe, chief information officer at the global logistics firm, commands a 70-strong enterprise IT team with 3,000 staff across business units in some 50 countries. “We’re working to get more visibility of the carbon we’re using and how to turn things off when we don’t want to use them,” says Davis-Pipe. “We stick solar on warehouses, we’re looking at using more renewable electricity, then we’re also moving from our own datacentres to more cloud-based services.” Customers increasingly demand information on emissions reduction, including a plan with science-based goals and demonstrable progress. Crown’s carbon-accounting platform has been calculating its carbon footprint, with 66% of estimated emissions accounted for by the end of 2023. It doesn’t plan to roll back the strategy, but it is buying more software and services off the shelf. In the past, it would have built its own. In-house IT skills have refocused on integration and data analytics, he says. Crown has also given countries and branches more leeway to improve IT environments locally – for instance, to achieve agility or efficiency within a governance framework. “We have core systems – main service delivery and financial systems – globally, but we’re much more open now for people to solve local issues locally,” Davis-Pipe explains. Automation and AI – beyond Copilot content in marketing – are also areas where the company is alert to future use cases that support the business and its net-zero goals, he says. Many firms may be in a similar position. Sarwar Khan, sustainability director at BT Group, reports that the company – and many of its partners and customers – are doubling down on net zero despite various pressures. “I sit in the business arm, with support for SMB [small and mid-sized business] customers, public sector, wholesale including channel partners. And the pressure to reduce [environmental] impact is not going away,” Khan confirms. “It’s a key priority.” While smaller businesses have “serious concerns” in terms of how they’re going to be sustainable and comply with net zero by 2050, they’re not backing off despite increasingly realising it’s an enormous task. Meanwhile, more specific key performance indicators (KPIs) on carbon, often revised quarterly, are appearing in the public sector. “SMBs are looking to big organisations, like us, to lead and support them,” says Khan. “In corporates, too, many are probably in that disillusionment phase, realising that they have to figure out how to operationalise it.” BT this year brought forward its annually reviewed net-zero target for the business to 2031, and for the customer and supply chain to 2041 – from 2050. How? “First, we looked at how we accelerate our plan on EV [electric vehicle] transition, as one of the largest fleet operators in the UK. Second, we looked closely at what we could reduce across our supply chain.” About 70% of BT emissions are Scope 3, so supply chain efficiencies are crucial. Tier 1 contracts are coming in for specific attention, he adds, and must have a science-based net-zero target against which they disclose performance. “If you don’t move the dial in that [Scope 3] space, getting to target is very difficult,” says Khan. BT is doing more advocacy – including alongside competitors – as well as looking at the make-up of its renewables certificates and power purchase agreements. Multiple innovations and efficiencies are crucial as datacentre power demand rises, Khan points out. Jon Healy, chief operating officer (COO) at datacentre solutions provider Keysource, reiterates that customers are shifting their net-zero strategies, including increasingly pushing suppliers to do more and reveal more rather than pulling back. Previously, some net-zero plans weren’t viable. “In our world, they’re not going to get more customers if they’re not addressing their own emissions. Of course, what’s difficult is to get there despite the pressures, including speed to market, constrained supply chains and demand for compute,” Healy maintains. “This has an impact right back to the drawing board, to strategic decision-making about where an organisation goes and which projects are fundamental.” Consequent designs have to underlie and underpin sustainability and carbon intensity, as well as support datacentre sector growth. Entire ecosystems are being evaluated. Upcoming infrastructure refreshes look likely to reap the benefits of currently evolving data, frameworks and metrics. “Companies must understand where their carbon emissions sit and what’s causing impacts or generating those emissions, and really pinpoint the detail to realise savings,” says Healy. Mary Jacques, director of global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and regulatory compliance at Lenovo, agrees. It is continuing to focus on full carbon accounting, increasingly homing in on Scope 3 supplier emissions, partly in response to customer requirements across its portfolio. It’s not about taking your foot off the pedal temporarily in response to unfavourable economics, she says. With AI particularly, there’s demand to understand full impacts and help customers build up AI investments and infrastructure “in the right way”, Jacques adds. “These are long-term commitments by their nature,” she points out. “Ours, including the net-zero targets, remain the same.” Progress towards lower emissions continues under the surface of reports, commentators suggest. For example, bidirectional information flows between Lenovo, customers and suppliers are still developing, but ultimately, organisations will better quantify and reveal progress on emissions. Michael O’Hara, founder of not-for-profit support group Techies Go Green, is aware of economic pressures affecting organisational emissions reduction plans. That said, he believes what’s going on is more a readjustment of expectations and deflation of greenwash, even overhyped “green growth”. “It’s like in the 1990s – the internet was going to change how we did business, and there was huge investment, and then the dot com crash. But slowly, surely, the ‘enlightenment’ period happened, maybe 10 years later,” says O’Hara. “The sustainability hype kicked in after the 2016 Paris Agreement and Biden took office, and when BlackRock said they’d prioritise sustainability investments in 2020.” If he’s right, going green looks about halfway along. O’Hara says we can still see longer-term sustainability and profitability. Short-term thinking can be the enemy in business, as much as in politics with leaders only looking to their next election. “Among our members, there’s still positive sentiment, but there is a slowness in moving forward and putting in the investment. To be honest, a lot of [previous] net-zero goals have been too high,” O’Hara says. Over time, though, he expects emissions reduction to embed into company cultures, not least as data and transparency improve, with teams increasingly buying into the requirements. Until now, this has proven difficult in many companies, with sustainability sometimes tasked to the marketing person or receptionist, rather than someone with physical levers to pull. A lot of education and information communication still remains to be done as well. O’Hara points out that people are still joining Techies Go Green – it now has 650-plus members and targets 1,000. That suggests many still take emissions reduction seriously. Ben Brial, founder of green platform engineering company Cycloid, agrees there’s progress, especially on carbon accounting. Yet “short-cut” generative AI (GenAI) projects, such as China’s DeepSeek, should remind industry that alternative paths to innovation can exist beyond brute-force financial scaleup. “Prior to AI, many had this mindset about ‘we grow at any cost’. The goal was to go faster, regardless of resource use,” says Brial. But organisations can develop new, more economical, more sustainable methods and strategies, including in emissions reduction. “Cheaper is not new, but the idea of pushing to use less resources is kind of a new game-changer,” says Brial. “We can think our way to different solutions and ways of achieving our priorities, goals and objectives.”

Projects Images Products Folders AD Plus Benefits Archive Content Maps Audio Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is a comprehensive urban planning strategy aimed at creating dense, walkable, and vibrant neighborhoods centered around public transportation hubs. By seamlessly integrating residential, commercial, and recreational facilities within close proximity to transit nodes, TODs seek to reduce automobile dependency, increase public transit ridership, and stimulate local economic development. Government agencies play a pivotal role in supporting these developments through zoning reforms, easing floor area ratios (FARs), selling air rights, and facilitating public-private partnerships to secure capital for public infrastructure. While TODs have gained global traction, East Asia boasts some of the most successful examples. Conversely, efforts to replicate these models in different contexts—such as New York City—highlight the importance of adapting TOD principles to local conditions, geographical characteristics, and community needs.

High population density ensures steady transit ridership and foot traffic for new developments, making significant investments in public transportation and related developments economically viable. The region's commitment to modern technology and continuous infrastructure upgrades contributes to reliable, efficient transit systems, further reinforcing public reliance. In cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, policies also actively discourage private car ownership: Hong Kong imposes automobile taxes for new vehicles typically exceeding 80%, while Singapore requires a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) that can surpass USD 70,000 just to own a car. These measures make public transportation the practical choice for the majority of residents.

Authorities often spearhead the planning and financing of these projects to ensure alignment with long-term urban strategies. Mixed-use developments—combining residential, retail, office, hotel, and recreational functions—are a common feature, fostering neighborhoods that remain active throughout the day and night. Climate considerations also play a vital role; given the region's frequent hot and humid weather, TODs are designed to offer comfortable, climate-controlled environments, sometimes at the cost of unsustainable practices such as large-scale continuous air-conditioning. Far from being just transit points, these hubs serve as essential community spaces where people gather, shop, and socialize, thus embedding themselves into the fabric of daily urban life.

Related Article Twenty Years of Transforming Transportation: Where Are We Now? The Case of Hong Kong: Transit as Both Infrastructure and Refuge Hong Kong's TOD model is globally renowned for its efficiency and seamless integration of transit infrastructure with commercial and residential spaces. Major transit nodes such as Admiralty, Hong Kong Station, and Kowloon Station have evolved into vibrant, multifunctional hubs that serve both commuters and local residents. Admiralty Station, which opened in 1982, exemplifies this approach. Originally established as a key interchange between multiple subway lines and bus routes, the development encompassed multitude of economic activities and services. It encompasses large-scale shopping malls, world-class hotels, modern office towers, and access to essential public facilities, including courthouses and parks. Admiralty's continual evolution has reinforced its status as a critical transit nexus; today, the area hosts over four luxury hotels, serviced apartments, high-end retail spaces, and extensive office complexes, including one built by Paul Rudolph as well as Zaha Hadid's latest addition, all interconnected with an ever-expanding subway network.

Beyond commercially driven TODs, Hong Kong also demonstrates the effectiveness of residential-focused developments strategically positioned near transit hubs. Tai Koo Shing, completed in 1985, is a notable example. Adjacent to its namesake subway station, the development comprises 61 residential towers with more than 12,500 apartment units. This close proximity to reliable public transportation has significantly enhanced property values and improved the overall quality of urban living for residents. The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability.

The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability. One of the defining features of Hong Kong's TODs is their active climatic control as a response to the city's weather conditions. With summer temperatures often exceeding 33°C (91°F) and humidity levels nearing 90%, air-conditioned transit hubs provide essential relief for commuters. These conditioned indoor spaces become informal extensions of public life, offering places to meet friends, relax, or simply escape the sweltering heat while waiting for a train. These hubs double as vital communal areas in a city with scarce outdoor public space.

Hong Kong's success with TOD is largely driven by the "Rail + Property" model pioneered by the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation. By leveraging land development rights around transit stations, the MTR finances the expansion and upkeep of its rail network through co-developments or the sale of air rights for property projects. This approach ensures the functionality of TODs and fosters the creation of dense, mixed-use neighborhoods. The synergy between transit infrastructure and real estate development creates a sustainable, self-financing urban ecosystem where transit accessibility, commercial vitality, and residential convenience reinforce one another.

The Case of Japan: Connectivity, Convenience, and Community Japan's TODs are distinguished by their exceptional focus on connectivity and user convenience. Major transportation hubs such as Tokyo, Shinjuku, and Shibuya stations exemplify how transit nodes can evolve into vibrant, multifaceted urban centers. Tokyo Station, a key national gateway, successfully leveraged the sale of its air rights to neighboring developments, generating the capital necessary to fund an extensive rehabilitation and modernization project. This initiative revitalized its aging infrastructure while enhancing its role as a central transportation hub. Shinjuku Station—renowned as one of the world's busiest—attracted significant private investment through zoning incentives that allowed for increased floor area ratios (FAR). This policy enabled the integration of public amenities, cultural venues, and commercial enterprises within the station's complex, transforming it into a dynamic urban nexus. Meanwhile, Shibuya Station prioritizes pedestrian connectivity, employing multi-level walkways and carefully designed circulation routes to navigate its densely built surroundings, thus improving ease of movement for thousands of daily users.

Rail commuting is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, with many residents regularly traveling significant distances for work. For instance, the approximately 55-kilometer journey between Kyoto and Osaka takes a mere 25 minutes on conventional trains (not high-speed trains), making long-distance daily commutes both practical and common. This efficiency surpasses even that of other well-regarded transit systems like Hong Kong. Recognizing these commuting patterns, Japanese TODs are designed as comprehensive service hubs where commuters can shop, dine, and complete errands without deviating from their transit routes. These station complexes have become essential social spaces, frequently serving as meeting points for friends and family. The country's extensive high-speed rail network further reinforces this role. A trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima—spanning over 800 kilometers—takes just over four hours by train without the need for time-consuming security checks or prolonged boarding procedures. To put this in perspective, a similarly timed journey in the United States, such as the train ride from New York to Boston, covers less than half that distance at approximately only 350 kilometers. This stark contrast underscores Japan's exceptional integration of local and long-distance rail systems, positioning TODs as indispensable elements of the nation's urban and social fabric.

A Case Study in New York: When TOD Ambitions Meet Local Realities New York City's Hudson Yards project was envisioned as a flagship TOD, anchored by the extension of the No. 7 subway line. The development aimed to create a modern, mixed-use neighborhood featuring luxury residences, upscale retail, and expansive office spaces. While Hudson Yards has primarily succeeded in attracting major corporations such as BlackRock and Pfizer, other aspects have underperformed. Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use.

Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use. The shortcomings of Hudson Yards underscore the importance of contextual sensitivity in TOD planning. Unlike the integrated transit hubs of Hong Kong and Tokyo—where major TODs function as central nodes within a larger, interconnected network—Hudson Yards operates as the last stop of Manhattan's transit system. Despite being geographically central, its location on the west side lacks the seamless connectivity that characterizes successful TODs in East Asia. For example, in Hong Kong, the journey from the international airport to Kowloon Station takes less than 30 minutes, delivering passengers directly into a mixed-use district with offices, hotels, and residential towers above the transit hub. This convenience facilitates door-to-door international business travel and contributes to the area's vibrancy and commercial success. In contrast, Hudson Yards' comparatively limited transit connections and absence of efficient airport access hinder its appeal as a truly integrated transit destination.

Whereas East Asian TODs typically incorporate essential services, affordable retail, and accessible public spaces to attract a broad demographic, Hudson Yards emphasizes high-end retail and upscale dining, making it less relevant to everyday New Yorkers. This exclusivity undermines the broader community engagement that TODs strive to foster. Hudson Yards illustrates that the replication of TOD principles without careful adaptation to the local urban fabric, commuter habits, and socioeconomic diversity can limit a project's potential to become a positive, inclusive urban hub.

Context Matters: From Transit Nodes to Urban Ecosystems The success of TODs in Hong Kong and Japan demonstrates that effective transit-oriented developments do far more than simply erecting buildings near train stations. They seamlessly integrate transportation with residential, commercial, and social infrastructure while responding to local climate conditions, cultural commuting habits, and community needs. In contrast, Hudson Yards reveals how TODs have its flaws when architectural spectacle is prioritized over everyday functionality or when developments fail to embed themselves within existing urban systems and ridership patterns. Even in East Asia, TODs are not without shortcomings; mega-development proliferation risks displacing local communities and replacing rich urban fabric with homogenized retail environments and standardized residential towers. Such outcomes highlight the importance of balancing large-scale planning with sensitivity to existing neighborhoods and cultural heritage.

Title: Who Is Friedrich Merz, Poised to Be Germany's Next Chancellor

Full Content:
Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protege of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 - when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall - transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favourite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

He forgot to say “unprovoked”. No USAID FOR HIM!! I guess this Rino doesn’t understand that Biden supposedly gave the support as a grant (according to Zelensky) whill European support is to be paid back. With people like this in the Republican party dwell on don’t need democrats. The worst part is that it ties us to that hopelessly corrupt neonazi government forever. DC is absolutely rife with corruption and Trump is trying to address that. Tying a hopefully recovering DC to Ukraine is like tying a recovering alcoholic with a hard core drunk and expecting him to stay sober. Trump is SMOKING THEM OUT!!! So be it. What is giving billions of dollars that the recipient can’t account for called, smart guy? Better to just see the 500 billion we gave them as a sunk cost and walk away. The resource deal is nothing more than a SOP to Blackrock and our bankers. But it’s horrific to put America in a partnership with Ukraine. The sHill is trying to craft a New Narrative. “Full Scale Invasion!!” “Putin, and Putin alone, should bear the economic costs of Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” Fitzpatrick said” Idiot, it was highly provoked, and well within international law. The ethnic cleansing in the Donbass allows any nation to intervene to stop it. It’s a long established UN principle. England borrowed billions from us in WW2 and paid it back...we did not extract it from Germany...Ukraine is no better than England. These congressmen are pretty free with other people’s money. Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, another damned FBI type in Congress. “During his time in the FBI, he spent time in Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine;” So THAT is who he represents. “ Trump is SMOKING THEM OUT!!!.” lol Fitzpatrick wasn’t smoked out. He’s always been a rino POS. A deal that includes a share of Ukraine’s natural resources for America is putting America first instead of putting Ukraine first. No one is forcing anyone. Funny how NATO will say if you agree to X, y, and z, you get to join and we will protect you. The Trump administration, here, says the following in the video below and somehow it’s “extortion” https://x.com/amuse/status/1892910114396381533 Pennsylvania Ping! Please ping me with articles of interest. FReepmail me to be added to the li Please ping me with articles of interest. FReepmail me to be added to the li FReepmail me to be added to the li Nothing says RINO like a Pennsylvania RINO. Check this guy’s bank accounts to see how much US funded Uke graft is coming his way. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) is obviously involved in the billions that the little Ukie pipsqueak can’t seem to account for! Fitzpatrick stole money from US taxpayers along with his demoncrat friends. Money laundering bastards! Of course the pipsqueak got his cut too. Not really. We had no particular alliance in place with Ukraine. Requesting some payback from the assistance is warranted.

The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming pivotal indicators, such as the US Core PCE Price Index and India’s GDP growth rate. The market’s mood remains cautious, with pessimistic sentiments likely to linger until there is a marked improvement in corporate earnings and a conducive environment with easy global liquidity and stabilised currency.” Citi on Indigo: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 5200/Sh versus Rs 5100/Sh (Positive) Citi on Federal Bank: Maintain Buy on Bank, target price at Rs 242/Sh (Positive) Jefferies on M&M: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 4075/Sh (Positive) MS on Cyient: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 1750/Sh (Positive) Nomura on Auto: EV policy to accelerate adoption, Tesla’s entry to benefit suppliers like Sona Comstar, Sansera and Motherson Sumi (Positive) CLSA on IT sector: Demand drivers improving; GenAI to be revenue driver going forward.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy.

Recommendation: Buy; : TP: Rs. 4,300 ; Upside: 18% About Monarch Networth Capital Ltd. (MNCL) Since 2019, Monarch Networth has embarked on an extraordinary journey of transformation. The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming pivotal indicators, such as the US Core PCE Price Index and India’s GDP growth rate. The market’s mood remains cautious, with pessimistic sentiments likely to linger until there is a marked improvement in corporate earnings and a conducive environment with easy global liquidity and stabilised currency.” Citi on Indigo: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 5200/Sh versus Rs 5100/Sh (Positive) Citi on Federal Bank: Maintain Buy on Bank, target price at Rs 242/Sh (Positive) Jefferies on M&M: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 4075/Sh (Positive) MS on Cyient: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 1750/Sh (Positive) Nomura on Auto: EV policy to accelerate adoption, Tesla’s entry to benefit suppliers like Sona Comstar, Sansera and Motherson Sumi (Positive) CLSA on IT sector: Demand drivers improving; GenAI to be revenue driver going forward.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy. India’s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in this fiscal year, raising apprehensions about corporate profitability and economic stability. Institutional activity reflected net FII outflows of ₹7,793 crore in the cash segment, while DII inflows stood at ₹16,582 crore, offering some support to the market.

Title: Ambulances, helicopters and medical advice: Behind the scenes at one of Ireland's 999 call centres

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. CHANCES ARE THAT if you’ve dialled 999 or 112, it has been a worrying time in your life. But for over 230 staff at the National Ambulance Service, your call was just one of around 1,000 emergencies that are processed at their command and control centres every day. The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), where calls are taken, is split across two sites: one is based in Tallaght in Dublin; and a smaller site is based in Ballyshannon in Co Donegal. In Tallaght, Martha Loorem can see the Dublin Mountains from her desk as she answers the phone to people in need from a centre that’s five storeys up. “It can be very varied; you know it pretty much covers everything,” she tells The Journal when asked to describe her work. “It can range from somebody with a cough or a cold [who doesn’t] know where to go for help or [who doesn't] have a GP, right up to… very tragic, very traumatic cases, and everything in between really.” Although no two emergencies are the same, Loorem says that there are some common features in the calls – and common types of caller – that they get. Every call-taker follows a script and inputs the caller’s answers about the situation they’re ringing about in order to determine the seriousness of the incident. Call-takers work 12-hour shifts, some during the day and some at night, but everyone alternates on a shift pattern. “I like the mix, so I wouldn’t want to do either full-time; I actually like switching between the two,” Loorem says. “I think it just suits me, I don’t really think I have a body clock any more. I suppose in terms of why I chose the job, I wanted to do something that I thought I would find rewarding. “There are calls where people are very, very sick, and they’re genuinely panicked, and they really don’t know what to do or where they’ve just seen something tragic; they need that reassurance on the other end of the phone as well, not only that the help is coming, but [that they can be told] what to do.” “When you have those calls where you know you made a difference, that is quite rewarding, and it is quite satisfying to bring somebody from being panicked to quite panicked, and then the ambulance gets there, and paramedics take over.” Martha Loorem, an Emergency call-taker with the National Ambulance Service Alex Rowley Alex Rowley As The Journal walks through the control room, it feels surprisingly calm given the number of people in it and the work they’re doing. However, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin assures us that things can get hectic during peak hours. “Everybody is trained as an emergency call taker,” he explains. “Technically, everyone is classed as an emergency medical controller… Generally, the journey is call taking, and then some will decide they want to take on dispatch.” There are rows of desks on either side of the room, with supervisors in a back corner who oversee everything. Screens hang from the ceiling which show how many call-takers are active across both call centres in Dublin and Donegal, as well as how many calls are coming in and the number of response vehicles that are in active use at a given time. At a dispatcher’s desk, Amy Curtis sends crews in the southwest of the country out to calls. She joined the NEOC after completing a PLC in the Pre-Paramedic Fire and Ambulance course at Blackrock Further Education Institute. Curtis spent two years as a call-taker before moving into her new role as an Emergency Medical Dispatcher just over six months ago. In her job as a dispatcher, she collates all the information received by call-takers and assigns an appropriate response vehicle and crew to the emergency. Dispatchers have to take into account a myriad of factors, including the severity of an emergency, vehicle availability, and the safety of the scene. “Dispatching is a lot more fast-paced than call-taking,” Curtis says. “I would call dispatching like putting pieces to a puzzle; you’re trying to figure things out for each case. Every crew member is your responsibility from the start of the shift until the end. “You need to know where all your crew members are and who is going where, because sometimes when the radio is going, and you are on your own at the desk, there could be six or seven radio transmissions, and you need to know what each crew is doing to be able to prioritise which crew you answer first.” Trainee dispatchers are mentored by a senior member of staff for 13 shifts before becoming fully qualified. This may seem like a relatively short schooling; however, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin points out that although it is a particularly difficult job, NEOC staff are constantly receiving further education through the HSE’s learning and development programmes. Advertisement “It is an extremely challenging environment for the dispatchers because [they are dealing with] multiple calls, and are getting a lot of information thrown at them from the radio and the people around the desk. “It’s about assimilating that information and putting it in a logical order in terms of its priority, and figuring out what each piece of information does to your next decision.” Larkin explains that there are various layers to learning how to dispatch, but that the ultimate outcome is patient care. All staff are licensed by the academy, and there is mandatory continuous learning associated with re-certification every two years. In yet another corner of the room, there is a set-up that looks like a mini situation room: it contains a whiteboard with codes, call signs, and maps with a row of desks in front. This is where the aero-medical dispatch desk is located, and the team that sit there are responsible for coordinating helicopter responses to medical emergencies. In Ireland, there are two helicopters available to the National Ambulance Service. The Air Corps operates one air ambulance from the Custume Barracks in Athlone, which is staffed by military pilots, an Air Corps Emergency Medical Technician, and an advanced paramedic from the NAS. In Cork, the ambulance service contracts another, smaller helicopter based in Rathcoole. In addition, the Coast Guard has four rescue helicopters based in Shannon, Dublin, Waterford, and Sligo, which are on hand to assist the ambulance service if required. The Coast Guard can organise medical evacuations for critically ill patients to other countries, such as England. It’s also responsible for pre-planning and dispatching the Critical Care Retrieval Service (CCRS) – like an intensive care unit on wheels, enabling critically ill patients to be transported to a major hospital alongside a team of specialist doctors, nurses, and pre-hospital practitioners. The National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght Alex Rowley Alex Rowley Daragh Lettice is one of the members of that team, and explains how he co-ordinates air ambulances to 999 incidents anywhere in Ireland, liaises with the Irish Coast Guard for search and rescue missions, and works with emergency teams for mountain rescues. “We also look after repatriations with a wider HSE group, the Treatment Abroad service, [looking after] any injured parties on holidays or whatever the case may be, technically, for anywhere in the world,” he says. “The flip side of that is that if we have a patient going out of the country, we would arrange all the logistics again. That may involve ambulance transport or an air ambulance with the Irish Air Corps, or from a list of private suppliers that are contracted to the HSE. The team also carries out vital work helping children who are on organ transplant lists, called the ‘Priority 1′ service. In those cases, the team’s job is to keep children’s details – their addresses, next of kin, and passports – on file and up to date. If a call comes in for transport, there is a four-hour window from the time of the call to get a child to the hospital, whether that’s in the UK or elsewhere. “Our goal is always to get advanced life support to the scene of an incident that may warrant helicopter transfer.” Lettice explains. “We see it as a completed mission if we deploy the advanced paramedic to the scene, regardless of whether the patient flies to the hospital or goes by road”. But what is the work like day-to-day? Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin puts considerable emphasis on the working environment of the control room and the overall culture within NEOC. The aim is to ensure that each staff member can operate at the highest level every day. The control room is full of people with experience working in clinical settings and in different parts of the HSE, with whom younger colleagues can liaise if they’re faced with a problem. There are also strong support structures in place for anyone who wishes to avail of them, should they feel overwhelmed by a particular emergency. “What we are really after here culturally is an environment where people can perform to their maximum ability but also an environment that encourages escalation and cooperation, so that nobody is sitting at their desks wondering, ‘What will I do here?’,” Larkin says. “We are very open about it: if you have an issue, put your hand up, and we will fix it together. “If that is on the aeromedical desk, dispatch desk, or call-taking desk, it doesn’t matter. “If we know about it, we can put the remediation in, and that is the culture that we absolutely promote.” Sometimes, those tasked with responding to 999 emergency calls need help too.

India’s second-biggest information technology services company has begun work much in advance to expand its largest contract worth more than $3 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys Ltd wants an early extension of the eight-year contract signed in December 2020 with German automobile major Daimler, the people added, with a new revenue arm added that brings in artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the deal. The Daimler project, dubbed ‘twice as fast program’ inside Infosys, has the company offering solutions in six areas—network, security, SAP basis, data centre, workplace, and operations—and assures it of average annual revenue of $400 million, according to the two people cited earlier. The data centre business brings in $160 million revenue annually, while the remaining software and hardware components bring in the balance $240 million. Also read | Healthcare: Inside the larger duel behind the Infosys-Cognizant court battle Infosys is looking to renegotiate and bolster the hardware and software business part with a seventh revenue arm—that of AI—into a new deal with Daimler, and expand the business by at least a year, from 2028 to 2029, according to the two people cited earlier. “We are told there will be an added AI component as part of the new RFP (request for proposal)," said one of the executives. “The overall revenue Infosys gets from Daimler in a year is expected to increase." The executive added that the discussions between Daimler and Infosys are at an early stage, and both companies remain hopeful of closing the contract by next year. However, Mint could not ascertain the incremental business Infosys would get from the German automotive company after the renewal.

For Infosys, the Daimler deal has helped business from manufacturing companies more than double in the past four years, from $1.3 billion revenue in the year ended March 2020 to $2.8 billion last year. During this time, Infosys grew 37% to end the fiscal year with $18.6 billion in revenue. “The early renewal indicates that emphasis is going to be on making additional investments likely in AI," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of Dallas-based IT research firm Everest Group, adding that other IT services companies might also look to rework their mega deals to have an AI aspect.

Title: Who is Friedrich Merz? Meet the conservative leader taking the reins of the German chancellery
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/23/germany-election-who-friedrich-merz/79860012007/

Full Content:
Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protégé of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 – when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall – transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favorite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

Title: Friedrich Merz: conservative set to be Germany's next chancellor

Time Published: 2025-02-23T18:58:20Z

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden A long-time rival of centrist ex-chancellor Angela Merkel within the CDU party, Merz has attacked her open-door migrant policy and drawn her ire for accepting support from the far-right AfD on the flashpoint issue in parliament. At age 69, trained lawyer Merz boasts a strong business background -- including at investment fund BlackRock and on many corporate boards, which made him a millionaire -- but has never held a government leadership post. Nonetheless, the combative orator seeks to project a statesman-like persona and has voiced confidence he can deal with mercurial US President Donald Trump, whom he has labelled "predictably unpredictable". As the three-way coalition of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz floundered, Merz as head of the opposition CDU/CSU block rained withering fire on the outgoing "green-left" government. Polls had long declared Merz -- despite lukewarm personal approval ratings -- the strong favourite to oust Scholz and bring an end to what Merz labels "three lost years" for Germany. In a recent blistering parliament speech, Merz likened Scholz and his allies to business managers who have bankrupted a company but still ask to extend their contracts by four years. "Do you know what the owners would say once they stopped laughing?" Merz asked mockingly. "They would politely ask you to leave the company. That's how it is in normal life." Merz's campaign promise was to revive the ailing economy and rebuild Berlin's international standing for "a Germany we can be proud of again". On Sunday a jubilant Merz -- eager to get going with his decades-old dream to run the country -- urged speedy talks to forge a new coalition government, warning that "the world out there is not waiting for us". 'Zero tolerance' Among his toughest pledges is to shut German borders to undocumented migrants, even if they seek asylum and to detain those awaiting deportation. Merz has in the past labelled the sons of Muslim immigrants "little pashas" and accused some Ukrainian war refugees of "social welfare tourism", before later apologising. Last month, Merz sparked high drama in parliament -- and waves of street protests -- when he pushed through a motion signalling his immigration crackdown with support from the extreme-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a long-standing taboo of never dealing with the controversial party. In other signals of a rightward shift, Merz has vowed a "zero tolerance" law-and-order drive, to reverse marijuana legalisation, limit "woke" policies and gender-sensitive language and study a return to nuclear power. READ ALSO: Tax to citizenship - What should foreigners in Germany expect from a CDU-led government? Merz argues all this will lure voters back from the AfD. But he may yet have to temper some of his policies as he seeks one or more coalition partners. Scholz during the campaign sought to portray his rival as a "hothead" and charged that his dalliance with the AfD signals he would one day rule with the far-right party -- a charge Merz strongly rejects. News magazine Der Spiegel has said Merz takes conflicts personally and is sometimes given to fits of anger, opining that "if Merz were a bullfighter, he would probably hold the red cloth in front of his stomach". Hobby pilot Merz, who is Roman Catholic, was born on November 11th, 1955, and lives among the rolling hills and forests of the Sauerland region of North Rhine-Westphalia state. At 198 centimetres (or six feet six inches) tall, Merz stands out in a crowd and is a licenced pilot who sometimes flies his own private jet. He has been married for more than 40 years to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has three adult children. He was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and soon after to the Bundestag, where his mentor was the late CDU powerbroker Wolfgang Schaeuble. After chancellor Helmut Kohl's long reign ended in a slush fund scandal, Merkel soon sidelined Merz to take over the party and went on to run Germany for 16 years. For over a decade, Merz pursued a career in the private sector but never gave up his life-long ambition of becoming chancellor. A free-market liberal who wants to cut corporate taxes and slash red tape to help Germany Inc, he outlined his views in a 2008 book titled "Dare More Capitalism". Merz has sought to turn his long stint in the business world into a key selling point, said political scientist Antonios Souris of Berlin's Free University. "He likes to flirt a little with this role of having returned to politics as an outsider, as an experienced captain of industry, not just a career politician like Scholz." His CV and personal wealth have left Merz open to charges of being out of touch with voters -- an accusation he has rebuffed by insisting he belongs to the "upper middle class".

After winning the German election, the conservative leader must navigate a new era without Washington as a close ally. This article is also available in: French BERLIN — Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany’s most American chancellor. Never in history has a German head of government had more affinity for the United States. Merz has traveled to the U.S. over 100 times, by his own tally, and counts former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as one of his role models. Merz, whose conservative alliance looks to have won Sunday’s national election with 29 percent of the vote, according to early official projections, is particularly fond of one Reagan quip that summarizes the German leader’s American-style skepticism of state intervention: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” But just as Merz is on the cusp of taking power in Germany, his cherished America has turned from indispensable friend to frenemy. Merz and other European mainstream leaders increasingly see the U.S. no longer a beacon — that “shining city upon a hill,” as Reagan liked to call it — but rather as another force joining Russia and China to steadily chip away at their ever-more brittle democracies. “This is really now the change of an era,” Merz said on stage at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month after U.S. Vice President JD Vance gave a speech that cast Europe’s centrist parties — not Russia or China — as the greatest threat to European security. “If we don’t hear the wake-up call now,” Merz added, “it might be too late for the entire European Union.” Vance’s appearance in Munich is likely to go down in European history as an epochal shift just as significant as Vladimir Putin’s 2007 speech at the same conference, when the Russian president effectively declared war on the U.S.-led liberal order. Now, it’s the U.S. administration itself that is turning its back on that consensus. German leaders, including Merz, have been especially slow to accept the new reality, declaring until recently that the transatlantic alliance will endure despite clear signals from the Trump administration that it will halt military aid for Ukraine, question the U.S. commitment to defend Europe, and bolster far-right, Kremlin-friendly forces. For Merz, an avowed transatlanticist, there could hardly be a ruder awakening. The question that will define his tenure will be whether he can lead Germany and Europe in defending the fraying liberal order without the U.S. — or whether, as Merz suggested in Munich, it’s already almost too late. This wasn’t how Merz had imagined his long-sought moment of victory. Born a decade after the end of World War II in Sauerland, a rural, mountainous region of West Germany, Merz was, by his own account, a less-than-spectacular student and an early smoker and drinker prone to disciplinary problems. Despite that rebellious streak, he was influenced by the deeply embedded conservative culture of the area and joined the center-right Christian Democratic Union while still in high school. After serving a brief stint in the military, Merz went to university in Bonn, then the capital of West Germany, where he studied law. Merz became a conservative member of the European Parliament in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Five years later he was elected to the German Bundestag, where he developed a close relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble, the CDU stalwart and forceful advocate of European Union integration. Under Schäuble’s tutelage, Merz rose in stature and was considered a likely choice for chancellor candidate. His rise ended in 2002, however, when he lost a power struggle with the more centrist Angela Merkel. Note: Without rounding, BSW’s result stands at 4.972 percent; Source: ARD Seeing no role for himself in the CDU under Merkel, Merz withdrew to the back benches, and in the midst of the world financial crisis of 2008 published a paean to free markets titled “Dare for More Capitalism.” A year later he left the Bundestag to work as a corporate lawyer while also taking the helm of Atlantik-Brücke, a lobby advocating transatlantic ties. While with Atlantik-Brücke, Merz pushed for an EU-U.S. trade agreement — the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP — and forged closer connections with the U.S., networking with American politicians and corporate leaders. One of his favorite places in the U.S., he told biographer Volker Resing, is the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where the former president is buried. Over a decade in the private sector, Merz sat on a series of corporate boards, including a four-year stint with U.S. asset manager BlackRock, a time he counts as among the happiest in his life, according to biographer Resing. Merz says this time provided him valuable experience outside of politics, but his critics accuse him of simply using his political connections to lobby for powerful interests, making himself a millionaire in the process. When Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018, Merz saw an opportunity to return to politics. Merkel’s centrism and generous refugee policies, Merz believed, had opened up the CDU’s right flank and allowed the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merz set out to undo much of Merkel’s legacy and aimed to pull the CDU sharply to the right. The party, looking for reinvention after 16 years of Merkel and an election loss to Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 2021, elected him chairman in early 2022 on his third attempt for the job. “I am deeply moved,” Merz said after the vote, fighting back tears. Though Merz and his conservatives emerged victorious in Sunday’s election, surveys suggest he’s not particularly popular among the public. In a country that remains deeply skeptical of the financial industry, Merz’s wealth and time at BlackRock, the American investment company, are often viewed with suspicion. It doesn’t help matters that Merz routinely jets around the country in his own twin-engine plane, which he flies himself, having fulfilled a lifelong dream by getting his pilot’s license in his 50s. “Friedrich Merz is not really very beloved, but he is respected,” Günther Oettinger, a former senior CDU politician and European commissioner, told POLITICO late last year. Yet Merz also has a reputation for being impulsive, thin-skinned and prone to populist bluster, particularly when it comes to migration. His defenders say he’s merely a risk-taker — at trait he took from his years in the private sector — and someone who doesn’t shy away from sharp-tongued debate. Merz took one of his biggest gambles shortly before the election. After a series of high-profile attacks blamed on asylum-seekers in the months before the vote, Merz saw his conservatives steadily decline in the polls while the AfD rose. In January, after a knife-wielding Afghan man attacked a group of preschool children in a park in Bavaria, killing one child and a man who tried to protect the children, Merz decided it was time for a drastic shift. In a taboo-breaking move that weakened Germany’s postwar “firewall” around the far right, he and his conservatives aligned with the AfD in an attempt to get tough immigration measures through parliament — including a proposal to reject asylum-seekers at the border. In response to Merz’s acceptance of AfD support, tens of thousands of outraged demonstrators turned out in cities across the country. “Merz can no longer be trusted,” said Scholz, whose center-left SPD came third in Sunday’s election. Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens, called Merz’s move “a disqualification” for the office of chancellor. But voters, who were broadly supportive of his tough migration policies, ultimately disagreed, lifting Merz to power. German conservatives have long hoped that Merz’s tough border policies, business background and familiarity with the U.S. will endear him to Donald Trump. “Merz is one of the Germans who is best connected in the U.S.” said Thomas Silberhorn, a conservative lawmaker specializing in transatlantic ties. “In this respect, I am very confident. He also knows the way things work. He is used to the mindset that you have to speak plainly.” Merz has also vowed to make “deals” with Trump. In an interview last month he suggested Germany could endear itself to Trump by buying American F-35 fighter jets and boosting defense spending to put Germany consistently above the NATO spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Despite the U.S. president’s love of tariffs, Merz also floated trying to bring back negotiations on TTIP, which collapsed during the first Trump administration. Until recently, however, Merz’s approach for confronting the Trump administration consisted mainly of denying the enormity of the challenge. Just a day before Vance’s speech at the MSC, Atlantik-Brücke, the transatlantic lobby group Merz formerly headed, published one of his essays on the transatlantic relationship. “Our alliance with America has been, is and will remain of paramount importance for security, freedom and prosperity in Europe,” Merz wrote. With Trump, he went on, “transatlantic relations will change again and yet we will continue to share common values, interests and a common promise of protection within NATO.” A few days later, Merz’s tone changed drastically as he warned of a transatlantic rupture. “The differences between the U.S. and Europe are taking on a whole new quality,” he wrote in a note to his supporters after Vance’s speech. “Now it is no longer ‘just’ about defense; now it is about our basic understanding of democracy and an open society.” Merz compared the moment to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when, as he put it, “we woke up from our dreams and had to learn to understand that our world is no longer what it was supposed to be.” German and European leaders were even more alarmed when Trump, a few days later, blamed Ukraine — not the Kremlin — for starting the war and then called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator.” Following Trump’s statements, Merz warned supporters at a rally in the state of Hesse that the “autocratic behavior at the top of the state” in the U.S. could persist for a long time. “Our response can only be that we must finally become resilient, capable of defense, and able to stand on our own feet in Europe,” he added. In an interview the following day, Merz warned that Europe should prepare for Trump to end NATO protection and hinted at a major strategic shift, saying Germany needed to discuss the possibility of “nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security” with European nuclear powers the United Kingdom and France. German conservatives have previously favored maintaining strong ties with the U.S. over calls from Paris to cultivate European “strategic autonomy.” Merz’s rhetorical shift showed just how unnerved he now is by the Trump administration. The question is whether Germany’s next chancellor will succeed in taking the EU — itself confronting the rise of Russia-friendly, far-right parties — in a fundamentally new direction. Merz has expressed a willingness to chart a new course, but the way forward remains murky. “Within this Europe, Germany must play a leading role,” Merz said at the rally in Hesse. “We must take on this responsibility. I, for one, am determined to do so.” Nette Nöstlinger and Rasmus Buchsteiner contributed to this report. Conservative leader’s gambit to weaken the postwar ‘firewall’ may be a boon for the AfD ahead of a national election. The AfD is using Elon Musk’s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump — and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election. The “chameleon” tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe’s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side. Dissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany’s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.

Successful nuclear energy companies have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring ... [+] cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation. Investors are excited about the nuclear energy outlook. Energy demand is on the rise, partly due to the rapid buildout of AI data centers. These technology campuses can use as much electricity as small cities. Nuclear energy is an appealing option for serving increased power demand because it has low carbon emissions and cost advantages relative to wind and solar power. If you expect nuclear energy companies to capitalize on the growing need for cheap, clean energy, then read on. The five best nuclear energy stocks introduced below may be worth a look for your portfolio. These nuclear energy stocks were selected by screening on the following criteria: The table below includes five U.S.-listed nuclear energy stocks that meet the above criteria, plus the market capitalization and business focus for each. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025 and best growth stocks. Vistra generates power and provides electricity to households and businesses around the country. The company operates natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar assets and battery energy storage facilities. With a total capacity of about 41,000 megawatts, Vistra is one of the largest power producers in the U.S. Vistra has been increasing and protecting its nuclear capacity by acquiring the minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary and extending licenses at two owned nuclear facilities. The company created Vistra Vision with an 85% ownership position after purchasing nuclear and retail assets from Energy Harbor in 2023. Vistra has great liquidity and an active share repurchase program. The third quarter 2024 balance sheet included $905 million of cash and equivalents plus nearly $2.5 billion in availability on a revolving credit facility. Share repurchases over the last three years have totaled $4.58 billion. The company has reduced its share count by 30% in that time, achieving a buyback yield over 7%. Vistra also pays a small dividend yield of 0.52%. GE Vernova is a clean energy spin-off from General Electric (GE). The company generates, transfers, converts and stores electricity in the U.S. and globally. GEV's power portfolio includes products and services for gas, nuclear, hydro and steam power generation. Since spinning off from GE in 2023, GEV has turned a profit and more than tripled its free cash flow. The company has also published a promising five-year outlook. GEV’s 2028 guidance includes $45 billion in revenue and $14 billion in free cash flow. This represents substantial growth from the 2024 results of $1.4 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Capacity expansions and rising EBITDA margins across the power, electrification and wind businesses will be key profit drivers. Nuclear will play a role in GEV's growth. The company's alliance GE Hitachi produces the BWRX-300 small modular reactor, which offers scale and size advantages. Specifically, the reactor can be constructed in 36 months and requires a much smaller plant footprint than other options. The BWRX-300 will be deployable globally as early as 2029. Talen Energy sells electricity produced by its nuclear, fossil, solar and coal power plants. The company's power generation capacity is approximately 10.7 gigawatts, including 2.2 gigawatts of nuclear power. Talen Energy has a relationship with Amazon’s cloud computing division AWS. The power company sold a nuclear-powered data center campus to AWS in 2023. Talen also signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with AWS. In November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) blocked the PPA due to transparency issues. Talen has subsequently filed a lawsuit against the ruling. Despite the FERC disagreement, the investment community is excited about Talen’s ability to supply carbon-free power to data centers. Analysts expect a revenue dip for Talen in 2025, followed by four years of double-digit growth. The average revenue growth expectation in 2026 is nearly 93%. The company also has a strong share repurchase program and good liquidity. The share repurchase target is 70% of adjusted free cash flow. At September 30, 2024, Talen had $648 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. BWX Technologies supplies nuclear components and services, primarily to the U.S. government. The offering includes naval nuclear reactors, commercial nuclear components and nuclear facility management. BWXT recently announced it would acquire Kinetrics, a leading nuclear services company. The acquisition, to close mid-2025, should add $300 million to BWX’s commercial segment. This complements the company's government business, which recently secured $2.1 billion in new naval nuclear contracts. Strength in the company’s government business drove 14% revenue growth and 15% GAAP EPS growth in the third quarter 2024. The company raised its full-year 2024 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the strong performance through the third quarter. The consensus price target for BWXT is $127.50, 18.4% higher than the stock’s current value. Centrus Energy provides uranium enrichment and nuclear reactor engineering services. Nuclear reactors require enriched uranium fuel, which has a higher concentration of the uranium-235 isotope. LEU is the only U.S.-owned, U.S.-technology uranium enrichment company. Centrus’s leadership team believes this is an advantage in winning U.S. federal contracts. The future opportunity in federal work could be substantial. There is currently $3.4 billion in federal funding already approved by Congress. However, $700 million of that is appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which President Trump paused by an executive order in January. Centrus already has multiple contracts with the Department of Energy, including one with a recently expanded Phase 2 contract value of $129 million. The company has sales momentum, too. 2024 revenue grew 38% to $442 million. However, higher cost of sales led to a profit decline in the period. Centrus does have a $3.7 billion backlog that extends to 2040. Bottom Line Nuclear companies are uniquely positioned to provide cost-effective, low-carbon energy to power the future. The ones that will rise to the top—whether they're power generators, reactor and component makers or service providers—will have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation.

Title: Vitalik Buterin Reveals the Most Disappointing Moment for Ethereum

Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:58:02Z
Full Content:
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced concerns over criticisms directed at Ethereum’s stance on blockchain-based gaming applications. During a Wednesday AMA session on the chat app Tako, Buterin addressed user Mable Jiang’s inquiry about moments in the past year that left him frustrated or disappointed with the Ethereum Foundation, its community, or the industry. Jiang also asked if he had ever considered taking a break. In response, Buterin expressed his disappointment, particularly over criticisms that Ethereum is “bad and intolerant” for not embracing blockchain-based casinos as openly as other networks. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” He stated. Despite occasional online rants about the network, Buterin, however, noted he finds comfort in personal interactions with the Ethereum community, most of whom remain committed to the platform’s original values. “I have a responsibility to this community and cannot abandon them. We Ethereum need to work together to create the world we want to see,” he added. Buterin also suggested potential strategic shifts to enhance the network, emphasizing the need for structural improvements for the network and greater decentralization within the Ethereum Foundation. He noted that the foundation, which currently facing a backlash for lack of neutrality, might need to be less neutral at the application layer and take a more active role in supporting certain initiatives. “This will require some changes,” he stated, adding, “But this project is worth doing.” Notably, Buterin’s response comes amid an ongoing debate in the blockchain space about balancing ethical considerations with open access. Some networks, like Solana, have taken a more permissive approach, welcoming applications across various sectors, including gambling and speculative ventures. However, this openness has also led to high-profile failures, such as the collapse of LIBRA, a meme coin on the Solana network. Recently, LIBRA collapsed, wiping out $4.5 billion in investor funds and causing a 15% drop in Solana’s value. Ethereum, in contrast, has long positioned itself as a network focused on decentralization, innovation, and long-term sustainability. These qualities have attracted institutional interest, with entities like BlackRock launching tokenized investment funds on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, beyond his frustrations, Buterin remains actively engaged in Ethereum’s evolution, particularly its scalability through Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In January, he reaffirmed Ethereum’s commitment to scaling via L2s, identifying key challenges such as insufficient space for BLOB objects and L2 heterogeneity. He detailed upcoming upgrades, such as the Pectra update, which aims to enhance Ethereum’s transaction throughput with long-term goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). He also underscored the importance of Ethereum’s economic model, advocating for ETH to serve as a “triple point asset,” functioning as a means of exchange, a consumable product, and a store of value. To strengthen Ethereum’s economic position, he proposed incentivizing L2 projects, optimizing rollup revenue structures, and adjusting BLOB pricing strategies.

Full Content:
February 23, 2025 10:09 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Ecwid should be on your radar if you want to sell digital or physical goods online, particularly if you're a newcomer to the e-commerce space. The platform differentiates itself from the competition via several notable features, including excellent website design tools, rich tutorials that quickly get you started making money online, and the ability to embed your store on third-party websites like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping. However, two caveats prevent it from climbing into the category's upper echelon: an extremely limited free tier and a lack of 24/7 customer support across its four plans. For more feature robust services that have 24/7 customer support, check out our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce platforms, Shopify and Wix Stores. Ecwid has four tiers: Free, Venture, Business, and Unlimited. Ecwid is one of the few e-commerce platforms with a free option, but the plan is quite limited. It restricts you to just five store items and email-based customer support. By comparison, Square Online offers a strong free tier that supports unlimited items and phone-based help (Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT). On the upside, you can advertise your Ecwid-powered site through Google, Meta, and Pinterest (TikTok advertising is locked behind the paid tiers), and get a free domain. The Venture plan ($25 per month or $21 per month with an annual plan) lets you store up to 100 total products in your online store, leverage live chat support when you have a question, sell on Facebook and Instagram, track inventory, and access Ecwid's mobile companion apps. The Business package ($45 per month or $39 per month with an annual plan) builds upon Venture with a 2,500-product inventory, the ability to sell via various online marketplaces (like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping), abandoned cart emails, wholesale pricing, and phone support. The Unlimited hosting level ($105 per month or $89 per month with an annual plan) removes the inventory cap, which is great for businesses with large product catalogs. In addition, you can integrate your Ecwid account with POS systems (like Alice, Clover, and Square) and enjoy priority customer support. Ecwid has zero transaction fees. However, the paid plans lack free trials. On the other hand, the Editors' Choice-winning Shopify (starting at $29 per month) offers unlimited products and 24/7 customer service across the board. You should check out that top pick, depending on your budget and the number of items you'd like to sell. Ecwid's sign-up process is extremely fast and easy; you just create credentials and name your shop. If you're new to Ecwid or e-commerce, the dashboard sets you up for success with a six-step tutorial on launching a shop and a 10-minute video that walks you through critical features. In the catalog tab, you add products, create product categories, and whip up gift cards (gift cards are limited to paid plans). Adding products is simple: You drag and drop product images directly into the window and optionally upload a product video. You feel the Free tier's limitations here, as inventory tracking and the ability to set stock numbers are locked behind the paid tiers. For example, if you only have five band shirts in stock, you cannot highlight to customers how many are available before they sell out. Likewise, uploading a product video is locked to the Business and Unlimited tiers. The Ecwid dashboard lets you create your shop's skeleton before entering the full editor. There, you'll find editing options for image and video sizes, image aspect ratios, data displayed on your product cards, and how you want your customers to navigate your store. In a nice touch, Ecwid lets you preview the changes as you implement them. Then, you choose a template from 73 premade ones. That's low compared with Wix Stores, which has nearly 1,000. Once a template is selected, you make changes using the full editor. The customization options are plentiful and, most importantly, intuitive. They let you update the site copy, swap images, and choose how products are displayed. Another welcome feature is the ability to switch templates even after going live. This isn't commonplace. For example, Wix Stores requires you to rebuild the site to switch to a new template. Although slightly bifurcated design tools risk confusion, Ecwid makes it seamless and easy to understand. It puts the right tools in the right sections and gives you many useful tutorials on tailoring your store. Afterpay, AmazonPay, Clover, PayPal, and Square are just five of the 61 payment gateways compatible with Ecwid. There's even a crypto.com option if that's your thing. If you use a supported payment gateway, follow the setup instructions to create an account and link your bank account. The knowledge base articles offer assistance when it comes time to get started with payments. Ecwid partners with Square and the physical Square Reader for in-person sales. Square is one of the most common and reliable physical POS systems on the market, so it's good that your Ecwid account syncs with the company's hardware. Shopify also handles both in-person and online transactions. You can accept bank transfers, cash on delivery, phone orders (which Volusion also supports), and check and money orders. Ecwid has a companion app for Android and iOS. The useful dashboard elements (ease of use, simple navigation) also apply to its mobile offering. The apps display your reports, lets you add products, and create barcodes for those products with your phone's camera. The ability to create barcodes is a unique feature and one we hope more e-commerce services integrate in the future. With the Ecwid apps, your shop is truly in the palm of your hand. In addition to adding products, you can manage orders, create discounts, set up payments, and manage the settings on your various sales channels (like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). Free-tier subscribers can test the app with a 28-day trial. Paid users have app access included with their subscriptions. Ecwid offers phone and chat-based customer support—if you're using the Business or Unlimited plan. The Free tier lacks live support (you must visit the aforementioned user forums and help pages), while the Venture tier supports web chat but not phone help. We're not fans of this tiered-based assistance. In addition, you can only receive a call back after you place a request via chat. In short, Ecwid's customer service is needlessly limited. On the upside, phone support is available 24 hours per day (Monday to Friday). Starting a business online can be stressful, and e-entrepreneurs want to hit the ground running with as few bumps as possible. On that note, Ecwid surprised us with its sleek interface, robust tutorials, and easy-to-use website editor. That said, the Free plan is far too limited, and the tiered customer support is a notable drawback of an otherwise positive experience.

For more feature robust services that have 24/7 customer support, check out our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce platforms, Shopify and Wix Stores. Ecwid has four tiers: Free, Venture, Business, and Unlimited. Ecwid is one of the few e-commerce platforms with a free option, but the plan is quite limited. It restricts you to just five store items and email-based customer support. By comparison, Square Online offers a strong free tier that supports unlimited items and phone-based help (Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT). On the upside, you can advertise your Ecwid-powered site through Google, Meta, and Pinterest (TikTok advertising is locked behind the paid tiers), and get a free domain. The Venture plan ($25 per month or $21 per month with an annual plan) lets you store up to 100 total products in your online store, leverage live chat support when you have a question, sell on Facebook and Instagram, track inventory, and access Ecwid's mobile companion apps. The Business package ($45 per month or $39 per month with an annual plan) builds upon Venture with a 2,500-product inventory, the ability to sell via various online marketplaces (like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping), abandoned cart emails, wholesale pricing, and phone support. The Unlimited hosting level ($105 per month or $89 per month with an annual plan) removes the inventory cap, which is great for businesses with large product catalogs. In addition, you can integrate your Ecwid account with POS systems (like Alice, Clover, and Square) and enjoy priority customer support. Ecwid has zero transaction fees. However, the paid plans lack free trials. On the other hand, the Editors' Choice-winning Shopify (starting at $29 per month) offers unlimited products and 24/7 customer service across the board. You should check out that top pick, depending on your budget and the number of items you'd like to sell. Ecwid's sign-up process is extremely fast and easy; you just create credentials and name your shop. If you're new to Ecwid or e-commerce, the dashboard sets you up for success with a six-step tutorial on launching a shop and a 10-minute video that walks you through critical features. In the catalog tab, you add products, create product categories, and whip up gift cards (gift cards are limited to paid plans). Adding products is simple: You drag and drop product images directly into the window and optionally upload a product video. You feel the Free tier's limitations here, as inventory tracking and the ability to set stock numbers are locked behind the paid tiers. For example, if you only have five band shirts in stock, you cannot highlight to customers how many are available before they sell out. Likewise, uploading a product video is locked to the Business and Unlimited tiers. The Ecwid dashboard lets you create your shop's skeleton before entering the full editor. There, you'll find editing options for image and video sizes, image aspect ratios, data displayed on your product cards, and how you want your customers to navigate your store. In a nice touch, Ecwid lets you preview the changes as you implement them. Then, you choose a template from 73 premade ones. That's low compared with Wix Stores, which has nearly 1,000. Once a template is selected, you make changes using the full editor. The customization options are plentiful and, most importantly, intuitive. They let you update the site copy, swap images, and choose how products are displayed. Another welcome feature is the ability to switch templates even after going live. This isn't commonplace. For example, Wix Stores requires you to rebuild the site to switch to a new template. Although slightly bifurcated design tools risk confusion, Ecwid makes it seamless and easy to understand. It puts the right tools in the right sections and gives you many useful tutorials on tailoring your store. Afterpay, AmazonPay, Clover, PayPal, and Square are just five of the 61 payment gateways compatible with Ecwid. There's even a crypto.com option if that's your thing. If you use a supported payment gateway, follow the setup instructions to create an account and link your bank account. The knowledge base articles offer assistance when it comes time to get started with payments. Ecwid partners with Square and the physical Square Reader for in-person sales. Square is one of the most common and reliable physical POS systems on the market, so it's good that your Ecwid account syncs with the company's hardware. Shopify also handles both in-person and online transactions. You can accept bank transfers, cash on delivery, phone orders (which Volusion also supports), and check and money orders. Ecwid has a companion app for Android and iOS. The useful dashboard elements (ease of use, simple navigation) also apply to its mobile offering. The apps display your reports, lets you add products, and create barcodes for those products with your phone's camera. The ability to create barcodes is a unique feature and one we hope more e-commerce services integrate in the future. With the Ecwid apps, your shop is truly in the palm of your hand. In addition to adding products, you can manage orders, create discounts, set up payments, and manage the settings on your various sales channels (like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). Free-tier subscribers can test the app with a 28-day trial. Paid users have app access included with their subscriptions. Ecwid offers phone and chat-based customer support—if you're using the Business or Unlimited plan. The Free tier lacks live support (you must visit the aforementioned user forums and help pages), while the Venture tier supports web chat but not phone help. We're not fans of this tiered-based assistance. In addition, you can only receive a call back after you place a request via chat. In short, Ecwid's customer service is needlessly limited. On the upside, phone support is available 24 hours per day (Monday to Friday). Starting a business online can be stressful, and e-entrepreneurs want to hit the ground running with as few bumps as possible. On that note, Ecwid surprised us with its sleek interface, robust tutorials, and easy-to-use website editor. That said, the Free plan is far too limited, and the tiered customer support is a notable drawback of an otherwise positive experience. If you want more robust e-commerce options, check out our Editors' Choice winners Shopify and Wix Stores. Mike Williams contributed to this review.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: The House of Cards of Russian Aggression Against Ukraine Collapses

The news from the New York Times is explosive: “U.S. Opposes Calling Russia Aggressor in G7 Declaration on Invasion”. U.S. opposition to a draft Group of 7 statement on the third anniversary of the Russian attack on Ukraine comes after President Trump blamed Kyiv for starting the war. Trump’s shift towards Putin’s Russia reverses generations of US policy. At the opening of the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, President Trump made it clear that Russia’s days of isolation are over and suggested that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion. Zelensky and Trump exchanged blows as the feud over the peace talks escalated. President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky an ‘unelected dictator’ after the Ukrainian President said Trump was ‘in a web of disinformation’. “Europe,” writes the Wall Street Journal, “is looking for a response after Trump blamed Kyiv for the war in Ukraine. Stunned by the US rapprochement with Russia over Ukraine, European leaders are trying to find common ground.” . . . Screenshot from WSJ . Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni “reaffirmed Italy’s support for Ukraine”, but prudently did not go to Kyiv to the commemoration of the third anniversary of the war. Vice-President Matteo Salvini is explicitly siding with Trump, wishing that “he will absolutely go ahead”. The parliamentary left-wing declares through Fratoianni “nothing in common with Trump on Ukraine.” However, it is announced that in Kyiv “the EU will reaffirm Zelensky’s legitimacy as president of Ukraine.” Who Zelensky is and what his role is, we documented in Grandangolo of 11 August 2023. We, therefore, report the essential part of it: Scott Ritter’s investigative documentary showing the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens, through which “his puppeteers provided him with a financial cushion” with a first payment of 41 million dollars. The film shows the luxurious villas that Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), in Israel, in Forte dei Marmi (Italy), in London, in Georgia, in Greece, and even in Crimea (the only bad investment, because Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also shows how Ukraine is being robbed of its most fertile land, sold off by Zelensky and Co. to multinational corporations. Still, it is also becoming increasingly indebted as the huge military supplies he receives from the US and the major European powers are not given away, but given on credit. This debt will increase with the ‘reconstruction‘ that Zelensky has put in the hands of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting February 23, 2025 by Laura 2 Comments Here’s our Big Family Food and Fun: February 16-22, 2025 post! Before launching into the week’s food and fun, I’ll share the tail end of last week’s fun. We were home relaxing for Sabbath that evening, enjoying fun treats and family time. Dinner that night was Fish Sandwiches – or just Fish Sticks for those who didn’t want a bun. We went through an entire Costco-sized bag of sticks, reminding me that almost everyone in our household likes these and it makes an easy meal that is different from our norm. Mental note: add fish sticks to the upcoming Costco list… Our Sabbath dinner also featured special sparkling water and the kids’ choice of a dessert. We practiced memorizing scripture while we ate and talked through what these verses mean in our lives. Sunday morning, we ate what has become our traditional, effortless Sabbath Sunday morning breakfast: Breakfast Cookie Bars that I’d made ahead and frozen. We had a lovely group join us at lunchtime, with 25 of us around the table that day. We had asked one of the families to please pick up Rotisserie Chicken from Sam’s on their way here, which they were happy to do (plus they brought their traditional Doritos that the kids all love). So our meal that day was three Rotisserie Chickens with Homemade Bread and Butter, Green Beans, Potato Salad, and Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookies. It was all so simple and so good, and a wonderful time of fellowship. Ms. Megan had brought a Color Wonder kit so many of the kids joined her around the living room table before and after lunch to color. :) Later that afternoon, we loaded our family up for a Kid Event at the Mall. Our friend Caitlyn had been at our house for lunch and joined us on our outing. Malachi hopped in too, plus our friend/housemate, Kermit. It was great to have so many adult helpers! The kids got free books, water bottles, games, and bubbles. They got to golf and play instruments. We had decided to make the most of this outing since we had braved the cold to get to the mall. So when the event ended, we headed over to the play area (as did many of the other families with kids at the event – so it was packed!). Malachi needed some new business-casual clothes for his work, so while the kids played, some of us went next door into H&M to shop. We scored some great deals from their clearance racks! And Anna made a new friend… I had packed us a picnic dinner – something we haven’t been able to do all winter long. But this was a great opportunity to enjoy a winter picnic, so we headed to the food court tables and had Peanut Butter Jelly Sandwiches, Salami, Cheese Sticks, Apples, Applesauce, and Carrots. As we were finishing up our meal, Matt bought an order of fries for everyone to have a small surprise treat before we headed home. There was no school on Monday or Tuesday of this week (pre-scheduled days off). It snowed all morning and part of the afternoon so we just hung out in the house, trying to keep kids busy. Brayden and Keith became occupied with Legos for two entire hours, creating the beginnings of a Lego City! Breakfast and Lunch that day was an assortment of leftovers as we finished up tidbits of Breakfast Cookie Bars, Chili, and Noodles throughout the morning/afternoon. I made a pot of broth that morning with the leftover chicken bones from the three Rotisserie Chickens the day before. For dinner that night, I used the broth to make Simple Chicken Noodle Soup. Tuesday was another scheduled day off from school. (With the weather being what it was, likely the kids would have had a snow day anyway!) I made Blender Pancakes for our breakfast that morning. Being cooped up in the house for the second day in a row was starting to affect everyone. So we tried to keep the kids busy with activities. They’d been listening to “Wavin’ Flag” on Alexa quite a bit, so I looked up the back story to talk through the origin of the song with them. Then we got out supplies to make flags. Was it the most exciting idea I’ve ever come up with? Nope. But did it kill twenty minutes of our day? Yep. So it was a win. Hahaha, Acacia’s enthusiasm… :) Brayden was excited to help me make lunch, so he cut up Beef Smoked Sausages to cook. While the rest of our lunch was cooking, the girls helped me make Breakfast Cookie Bars for upcoming Sabbath Sunday breakfasts. Lunch was a very exciting offering of Sausages, Mac and Cheese, and Peas. Mmm, the Breakfast Cookie Bars turned out just right this time. Matt played a game with Brayden and Kiya that afternoon… Then our friend, Cindy, and two of her kids came to hang out. This was such a blessing for our evening as our kids love playing with her kids and Cindy poured love into our family the entire time she was here. Brayden and Kiya helped her make little Pigs in a Blanket to go with our dinner. We enjoyed a fun meal of Chicken Nuggets/Strips, Pigs in a Blanket, Fries, Fruit, and Salad. Wednesday turned out to be a Snow/Cold Day off from school. Anna helped me make a batch of Flourless Chocolate Banana Blender Muffins that morning. Did she get to lick a spatula after we got the batter mixed up? And had Josie made her way into the kitchen and needed a spatula to lick also? The Flourless Chocolate Banana Blender Muffins turned out great and helped us get through the day as everyone needed something to munch on. At lunchtime. Acacia helped me prepare leftovers. I was determined to clean out the fridge so we got out jars of pickles to finish off along with our lunch. She felt it was necessary to open the jars with the rubber gripper. It was a big day for some of the adult Coppingers! Matt, the four older boys, and Malorie had bought tickets to go to KC to watch Messi play. The weather postponed the game, and yet Wednesday’s rescheduled game was still going to be played in freezing cold temps. Did they decide to still go? Yes, they did. Did they realize they were a bit crazy for all of this? Also, yes. Did Arrow fully support their choices?? Everyone gathered at the Castle and we sent off the heavily bundled up soccer fans (Matt, Asa, Justus, Elias, Malorie, Malachi, plus two friends from Lincoln who hopped in). Eva, Kelsey, Arrow, and Little Sweetheart stayed back at the Castle with me to help with kids throughout the afternoon/evening. Eva read lots of books to the littles. At one point I think she had six kids piled around her, but they scattered before I could get a picture of them all. Kelsey played several games at the table. We needed something active to do (it day three in a row of not leaving the house, oy!). So I told the kids that if they cleaned up the living room and play room, we’d be able to set up an Obstacle Course like I had done a few weeks ago. Auggie got a turn with the vacuum. :) Eva captured this shot of me explaining the obstacle course to the kids. It started at the bottom of one set of stairs, went all the way through the living room and playroom, up the other set of stairs, and back. Phew. It involved masking tape and sour cream lids (fancy!). The kids wound their way around the house over and over. Meanwhile, Eva and Kelsey took advantage of the kids being occupied to put their babies in the high chairs to feed them. Look at Lolli’s grandbabies eating like big kids. :) :) :) Knowing the day would be full, I’d put Spicy Ham and Potato Soup in a crock pot that morning. At dinnertime, we served it up – so easy. I had kind of been dreading the day that Matt and so many other adults would be heading out of town, leaving us behind with kids. But wow was it great having Eva and Kelsey and their babies here! I truly enjoyed the day with them and am so thankful for the gals our boys have chosen. OUR DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW ARE AMAZING! MEANWHILE, in Kansas City at the game, Messi scored a goal right in front of our crew. AND, while cheering, several of our peeps made it on television. A couple of friends watching the game from home realized, “Hey, that’s the Coppingers!” so they got screen shots and sent them to our boys. It is so much fun to have this shot of Asa, Justus, Elias, and Malorie! For the record, after this moment, everyone determined that it had, in fact, been worth it to drive all the way there and freeze half-way-to-death to be a part of this moment. Thursday was – guess what? – another Snow/Cold Day off from school. The weather promised to warm up over the weekend, but meanwhile, the temps were still dangerously cold. So, while we considered leaving the house to keep us all from going stir-crazy, we just didn’t want to endure the misery of the cold. So we hunkered down at home, trying to maintain peace while we played. I’d pulled out a pan of Chicken Cheeseballs from the freezer that I’d made a few weeks ago, so we baked them for lunch. I also made two tortilla packages worth of Quesadillas and opened three cans of fruit for our meal. After lunch, I baked two pans of rice and browned 2.5 pounds of hamburger meat. I stirred all of the rice and cooked meat into a large pan and turned it into a form of Taco Rice Skillet for our upcoming Sunday Lunch. That afternoon, I pulled kids into the kitchen to help me make Peanut Butter Honey Fudge. I had almost forgotten this recipe, but it was a perfect treat to make since we were cooped up and needed an activity. Brayden got to to do the stove-top part of this. Then we scooped the mixture into fun molds, then the rest into a dish. Dinner that night was Costco’s Tortelloni with Sauce plus Steamed Broccoli. A few years ago, I did a price breakdown to share that this entire meal only cost $1.41/person. Want to see what the cost is after inflation 2.5 years later? I did the math!! After dinner, we ate some Peanut Butter Honey Fudge! Then we spent the rest of the evening playing Charades. Oh, and Kelsey sent me this delicious picture of their dinner that night: Simple Pizza Chicken Bake! With a January full of sickness and a February full of freezing cold temps and a household full of constant intense-kid-needs, I felt like I’d been hanging on for dear life. I have been getting up early each morning to have some glorious time in the Word and in prayer. But otherwise, I’m on the go all day with needs piled on top of each other. God made it very clear to me on Friday morning that I needed to meet my own needs so that I could effectively care for my family. So as soon as I was able, I packed myself up and headed out the door. (The kids were able to be back in school that day!) I sat at Panera by the fire with a cup of coffee, resting and working. In a setting like this, my work is restful, which is a blessing. Feeling refreshed and enjoying my alone time, I headed next door to Costco. I looked through clothing for clearance sales, then filled the bottom of my cart with fresh produce. I then decided that since I was kid-free, I should stock up on everything we’d finished off at home during the past couple of months. Did I need a second cart? Yes. But did I get one? No. I just kept piling my one cart higher and higher. Craziness. Back at home, Matt and I got groceries brought in and put away before picking up kids from school. I had a smile back on my face again, thanks to the down time I’d enjoyed. Anna washed grapes for our dinner while Brayden and Kiya helped with other parts of our meal. We had Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, Tomato Soup, Onion Rings, and Grapes. Saturday morning, Malorie and I left all the kids home with the guys while we headed to church for a Ladies’ Brunch. The speaker was none other than our very dear Kelsey. The morning was incredibly wonderful in so many ways and I’m so thankful we got to do this. Back at home, Asa, Arrow, Justus, and Little Sweetheart had joined our crew so I went home to kids, grandbabies, and big boys. I felt so filled and blessed. The Italian Cream Cheese Chicken I’d started before the brunch smelled good when we got back! That evening, we were planning to celebrate Justus’ birthday a week late, and this was his dinner choice. Malachi had made a batch of Hot Cocoa while we were gone. I love that he does this! Brayden and Kiya helped me make Butterscotch Bars for the night’s birthday celebration. We slid them into the oven, I finished this post, we got some cleaning done, then the family joined for Justus’ birthday. And that was our week!

After a brief and relatively quiet week for earnings, this week promises to bring a wave of significant reports, offering valuable insights into the future trajectory of key sectors such as AI, technology, and finance.

Title: The Federal Supremacists Write a Ticket Good for One Ride in Williams v. Reed

Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Josh Blackman | 2.22.2025 9:07 PM Last week, I taught the Supreme Court's anti-commandeering cases in Constitutional Law. The precedent can be stated simply. New York v. United States held that Congress cannot compel state legislatures to enact legislation. Printz v. United States held that Congress cannot compel state executive branch officials to enforce federal law. And NFIB v. Sebelius held that Congress cannot compel people to engage in economic activity. However, Congress can compel state judges to enforce federal law. Article VI, Clause 2 maintains that "the Judges in every State shall be bound" by the supreme law of the land. In Printz, Justice Scalia acknowledged that since the framing, state judges have enforced federal law. A student asked if Congress could commandeer state courts, as well as state judges. The answer to this question is complex. In my view, the answer should be no. I developed this thesis in a 2016 article in the Illinois Law Review, titled State Judicial Sovereignty. In short, if a state legislature creates a court of true general jurisdiction, then a state judge can hear any federal cause of action. But if a state legislature divests a state court of jurisdiction over some federal cause of action, the action cannot be heard. Congress cannot commandeer the state legislature to vest their courts with jurisdiction, and the Supremacy Clause does not empower the courts to establish that jurisdiction. Remember, state court jurisdiction comes from the state legislature, and not the Constitution. Regrettably, the Supreme Court rejected my approach in Haywood v. Drown (2009). In this case, which most people have never heard of, New York divested its courts of jurisdiction to hear damage claims against correction officials. As a result, those courts would have lacked jurisdiction to hear Section 1983 suits against prison guards. Justice Stevens's majority opinion held that this jurisdictional statute was actually an attempt to immunize prison officials under Section 1983. Haywood was 5-4. Justice Thomas wrote the dissent, which was only joined in part by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justice Scalia and Alito. The quartet agreed that New York should prevail under longstanding precedent. But only Justice Thomas was willing to go a step further and say those precedents were wrong. In short, even if state judges are bound to enforce federal law, state legislatures have complete and total control over the jurisdiction of the state courts. If a plaintiff does not like those rules, he can bring a Section 1983 suit in federal court. It has long bothered me that Justice Scalia did not join all of Justice Thomas's dissent in Haywood, but such is life. (Update: I previously wrote the case was 8-1, which it sort of was for the issue I was talking about, but it is better to call it 5-4.) Fast-forward to the present. On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Williams v. Reed. On the holding, the Court split 5-4. Justice Kavanuagh's majority opinion held that state courts must allow a Section 1983 claim to proceed where a state exhaustion requirement "in effect immunizes state officials" from liability. In my view, this case goes beyond Haywood. The Court expands federal court oversight of state court jurisdiction. I see this decision as vindicating the supremacy of federal courts. You may recall that Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh dissented in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern. I see that position as parallel to Williams. Of course, Justices Sotomayor and Jackson joined the majority, though I suppose the context was different enough. Yet I'm not sure that the Chief was fully on board with the Haywood expansion. Justice Kavanaugh explains how limited this opinion was. He stresses the Court reverses on a "narrow ground" and "emphasize[s]" the opinion is "narrow." Kavanaugh writes that his decision "resolves this dispute but is careful not to go beyond this Court's existing precedents." You know a five-member majority is fragile when this sort of language is added. Chief Justice Roberts assigned this opinion to Justice Kavanaugh. I suspect the Chief then conditioned his joining on this sort of limiting language. The federal supremacists issued a ticket good for one ride. Justice Thomas wrote the Williams dissent, which had two parts. Part I was joined only by Thomas. And Part II was joined by Thomas, as well as Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett. Part II argues that the majority misconstrued, and indeed expanded Haywood. I find that analysis quite compelling. I also think that the issue was waived, and that Justice Kavanaugh botched the facial/as-applied analysis. (I have to imagine this part was very important for Justice Barrett's join, especially in light of NetChoice.) But Justice Thomas was alone in Part I, regrettably. Thomas repeats his call that Haywood was wrongly decided based on "first principles." (Chief Justice Rehnquist used this phrase in Lopez.) This case is straightforward under first principles. Our federal system gives States "plenary authority to decide whether their local courts will have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal causes of action." Haywood v. Drown, 556 U. S. 729, 743 (2009) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Constitution allows States to hear federal claims in their courts, but it does "not impose a duty on state courts to do so." Id., at 747. Thus, "[o]nce a State exercises its sovereign prerogative to deprive its courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action, it is the end of the matter as far as the Constitution is concerned." Id., at 749. . . . Our precedents also err in establishing the requirement at issue here—that state jurisdictional rules be "neutral," even in the absence of a directly conflicting federal law. See infra, at 5. The Supremacy Clause does not of its own force"constrai[n] the States' authority to define the subject-matter jurisdiction of their own courts." Haywood, 556 U. S., at 750 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Thomas also explains that plaintiffs are free to bring suit in federal court. This case is much ado about little. Justice Thomas also wrote a glorious footnote that takes a potshot at Charles Reich. I suspect Justice Alito regrets not joining this footnote about his former constitutional law professor. (Alito has many times told the story about how Reich abandoned his class in the middle of the semester to go to San Francisco.) * Petitioners' suit implicates other precedents that may not withstand scrutiny. I doubt that petitioners have a true due process interest in "mere Government benefits and entitlements." Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 201, n. 3 (2023) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Tellingly,the Court's original expansion of the Due Process Clause into this context came without meaningful legal analysis. The Court simply highlighted the social importance of "entitlements," which had come to make up "[m]uch of the existing wealth in this country," and which only the poor had been theretofore unable to effectively enforce. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 262, and n. 8 (1970) (citing C. Reich, Individual Rights and Social Welfare: The Emerging Legal Issues, 74 Yale L. J. 1245, 1255(1965); C. Reich, The New Property, 73 Yale L. J. 733 (1964)). As Justice Black recognized at the time, it "strains credulity" as a textual matter "to say that the government's promise of charity to an individual is property" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. 397 U. S., at 275 (dissenting opinion). Amen. Thomas also casts doubt on whether Section 1983 even creates a cause of action. Here, Thomas cites an important new article by Tyler Lindley. Moreover, further examination may be required as to whether §1983 can provide petitioners a cause of action in any event. Cf. T. Lindley, Anachronistic Readings of Section 1983, 75 Ala. L. Rev. 897, 900–901 (2024) (contending that, as originally understood, §1983 did notprovide a freestanding cause of action). This statement is consistent with Thomas's opinion in DeVillier v. Texas, and his dissent in Wilson v. Hawaii. These cases recognize that the Constitution does not create positive causes of action for relief. Conservatives routinely call on Justice Thomas to retire. Would any replacement continue to make such important and principled contributions to the law? Does anyone else have the right combination of courage and curiosity? I am doubtful.

Title: NVIDIA To Surge 20% With Earnings?

CHINA - 2025/02/13: In this photo illustration, an Nvidia logo is displayed on the screen of a ... [+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on – Nvidia’s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Next Big Energy Boom: How the Green Scam Collapse Is Driving a Historic Bull Market

Editor Economy International Man, Nick Giambruno “It was the single most important financial event of my career.” My friend and resource investing legend Rick Rule once shared this with me, reflecting on his experience in the uranium market during the last bull cycle—where extreme supply and demand imbalances triggered massive booms and busts. Rick was referring to Paladin Energy, a uranium stock that skyrocketed during uranium’s last bull market from less than one cent ($0.007) Australian dollar (AUD) per share at its bottom in April 2003 to AUD $9.57 at its peak in April 2007. It was a peak gain of over 130,000%—a greater than 1,000-fold increase. In other words, a $1,000 investment could have exploded into more than $1 million—had someone picked the bottom and top perfectly. Of course, that is not realistic, but as we can see in the chart below, even being within a year of the absolute bottom and top would have been enough to generate some phenomenal returns. Other uranium stocks also multiplied their share prices during the last bull market. However, Paladin was a rare and unique example. It was the best-performing company in the industry during the previous cycle. However, as stunning as Paladin’s performance was, it’s important to remember that past performance does not indicate future results—for any investment. I suspect it won’t be long before Western governments turn to nuclear energy in a big way. There are indications they are already doing that. In short, the Green Scam delusion is an enormous market distortion—a blessing in disguise. Distortions in the market allow shrewd speculators to get positioned for big potential profits as they collide with reality. It’s making uranium’s already attractive supply/demand situation even more appealing. Uranium mining stocks stand to be a primary beneficiary of this trend. In short, it is difficult for producers to ramp up production while uranium demand is rising. It often takes years for them to catch up. As a result, price is the only way for the market to resolve itself. That’s why the uranium price can have extraordinary spikes. However, the uranium market often doesn’t just settle into equilibrium during these periods. The uranium price often overshoots where it needs to go to balance the market, creating an enormous bull market. It’s a cycle that has played out three times before, and I think it will occur again soon. Looking at the Big Picture for uranium, I see a precarious supply situation, a long lead time to develop new mines (roughly ten years), dwindling inventories, and an unstable geopolitical situation in which countries are scrambling to secure their energy supplies. Yet, at the same time, there is growing (inflexible) demand for new nuclear power plants. With supply shrinking and demand rising, I think the stage is set for uranium prices to overshoot to the upside, just as we saw in the previous three bull market cycles with similar dynamics. The energy markets aren’t the only place where massive disruptions are unfolding. A dangerous combination of sky-high debt, relentless money printing, and deep cultural and political shifts is creating unprecedented economic instability. We are entering an era of volatility unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history—and those who fail to prepare could see their wealth and freedom evaporate.

Title: Exclusive — Nate Morris: America Has to Fight Back Against the Climate Change, 'ESG Mafia'

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris on Breitbart News Saturday said that America has to fight back against the environment, social, and governance (ESG) “mafia,” noting how large Wall Street firms push leftist policies on corporations. Morris spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as he considers a potential run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show the Sopranos. “I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday. ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others. Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies. Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. “We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked. Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

Title: MERCK INVESTOR ALERT: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Announces that Merck & Co., Inc. Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit - MRK

February 22, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, all dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck as well as certain of Merck’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck’s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 “there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%” “primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon just sold a massive amount of his company’s stock. New SEC filings show Dimon sold a total of 866,361 shares at a price of $269.83 on Thursday, worth a whopping $233.77 million. According to the SEC Form 4 filing, the shares sold are attributed to various entities including his family, GRATs, LLCs, and his spouse. As Dimon executed the sale on February 20th, shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) sank from record highs at around $278 down to $266. In February of last year, Dimon initiated his first-ever sale of the company’s stock since becoming CEO in 2005. He then executed another sale in April, completing a combined $182 million in sales in 2024. Although Dimon has not made public comments on the sales, a company filing said they’re part of a predetermined plan for “financial diversification and tax-planning purposes” and that Dimon “continues to believe the company’s prospects are very strong and his stake in the company will remain very significant.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have surged 44% in the last year amid a broad spike in bank stocks, driven by a resilient economy and record-breaking earnings.

Title: Software engineering job openings hit 5-year low amid industry shift
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106878-software-engineering-job-openings-plummet-35-five-year.html
Time Published: 2025-02-22T15:50:00Z
Full Content:
Cutting corners: The software engineering job market has experienced a significant downturn, with job openings hitting a five-year low, according to an analysis of data from Indeed by Practical Engineer. The statistics reveal a stark 35 percent decrease in software developer job listings compared to five years ago, marking a dramatic shift in the industry's employment landscape. This decline is particularly noteworthy when compared to other sectors. While the overall job market has seen a 10 percent increase in listings since February 2020, software development positions have plummeted. This contrasts sharply with growth in areas such as construction (25 percent), accounting (24 percent), and electrical engineering (20 percent). The software development sector has also experienced very volatile fluctuations in recent years. Job listings more than doubled during the pandemic-era boom of 2021 and 2022, outpacing all other industries. However, this surge was followed by an equally dramatic fall, with current vacancy numbers 3.5 times lower than their mid-2022 peak. Trend in software development job postings in various countries - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Several factors contribute to this decline. The end of zero-percent interest rates has had a significant impact on the tech industry, affecting hiring practices, venture capital funding, and the survival of tech startups. However, this alone doesn't explain the hiring slowdown and layoffs at highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google, according to author Gergely Orosz. He posits that many companies may still be adjusting after over-recruiting in 2021-2022, leading to a more cautious approach to hiring. Additionally, the rise of generative AI and LLMs may be influencing the job market. These technologies have shown particular promise in coding – 75 percent of engineers reported the use of AI coding tools in a recent survey. Some speculate that companies might be adopting a "wait and see" approach, assessing the potential productivity gains from these tools before expanding their engineering teams. Salesforce's recent decision to keep its software engineering headcount flat while reporting a 30 percent productivity gain from AI tools exemplifies this trend. However, this also raises questions about product development and market fit, as the company simultaneously plans to hire additional salespeople. The emergence of highly efficient small teams at companies like Linear and Bluesky challenges traditional notions of engineering team size. These companies have achieved significant user bases and product adoption with remarkably small engineering teams, suggesting a potential shift toward leaner, more efficient development processes. All job postings on Indeed vs software development job postings - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Orosz also points out that Indeed's data may not provide a complete picture of the job market. The platform may be losing popularity for posting software engineering jobs, particularly among startups and some Big Tech companies. For instance, Microsoft lists more software-related jobs on its own site than are reflected in Indeed's data. So, while the Indeed data should be considered directionally correct, indicating a genuine decrease in developer job listings, it may not fully represent hiring trends in startups or accurately track Big Tech hiring. Still, it is clear that the software engineering job market is undergoing significant changes, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and evolving company strategies.

It’s halftime at Twickenham and Scotland lead England 10-7. Thank you for your company today. Ireland win in Cardiff and all roads lead to a meeting with France at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday week. Man of the match Jamison Gibson-Park 🗣 "They're an unbelievable team, a proud nation, they showed that today."🗣 "It would be a dangerous thing to do to come over here with preconceived ideas."Player of the Match Jamison Gibson-Park after Ireland's battling win in Cardiff. #WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/Lgv9nrNqt5 MATCH REPORT: Gerry Thornley has his say. “The home side were, as expected, much improved; beyond recognition in truth. As was always liable to be the case, Matt Sherratt had injected enthusiasm, energy and no little cohesion in his first game in charge. Their set pieces were strong and with a much more balanced 9-10-12-13 combination their attack had variety, shape and width. Ireland’s initially confident and smooth start unravelled in large part through ill-discipline and especially scrum penalties. This was compounded by Garry Ringrose incurring a red card following a bunker review for his 35th-minute high hit on Ben Thomas, and Ireland were relieved and indebted to this being a 20-minute red card, not least as Bundee Aki was an ideal replacement.” You can read the full match report here Scotland lead England 10-7 at Twickenham after 24 minutes. James Lowe produced another brilliant performance. He’s what he had to say about a tough afternoon in Cardiff. One of Ireland's key men yet again this afternoon.Great to chat to James Lowe live from Cardiff.#WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/EM4moAonb0 PLAYER RATINGS: Johnny Watterson gives James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park and Jack Conan 8/10. You can read them here A fitting tribute Not sure Finlay Bealham, gets enough credit! Again If you like what you see, please like share and follow, cause I've f#%k all other reasons to do them! 🙏❤️#SixNations #WalvIre @IrishRugby #FinlayBealham #Rugby pic.twitter.com/4dyhpxFZf1 Easterby: “We’re pleased with the result. There’s lots of things we could have done better. I’m pleased with how we got ourselves out of a hole.” ⌚️ Sam Prendergast slotted the three points for Ireland against Wales to steer his side to a win and a Triple Crown in Cardiff 🙌#Breitling #DefiningMoment @Breitling pic.twitter.com/MvYnOUZPWh Watching the Andrew Porter incident again. No wrap from replacement tighthead prop Thomas his arm in tucked and even though it is chest to shoulder, it is not a legitimate attempt to tackle. Therefore should have been a yellow card. Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are going through the subbing machine and will be available here presently. Simon Easterby, calm and measured in victory. Acknowledged some of the shortcomings, gave credit to Wales, which they deserved and pointed to the fact that his tea showed character to see out a match that got sticky. 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬 🤩#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/SRbft74lqH Garry Ringrose yellow card that was upgraded to red Garry Ringrose's tackle upgraded to a 20-minute red card. #WALvIRE Ireland will be back to 15 men 10 minutes into the second half. pic.twitter.com/1hPGQcL0wP 🤩 Watch for the rugby, stay for the finish from Tom Rogers 😍#GuinnessW6N @WelshRugbyUnion pic.twitter.com/UVZrZPxfJG The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d IT’s only fair that we show the two that Wales scored. 😎 Captain Jac takes Wales into the lead 💪#GuinnessM6N @WelshRugbyUnion pic.twitter.com/df7CgDSWjG Let’s have a look at Ireland’s tries. A stunning cross-field kick to James Lowe! Jamie Osborne is there to collect the ball and score!! #GuinnessW6N pic.twitter.com/5Eq7cq0Lz8 Johnny Watterson’s player ratings, lot of red pen you’d suspect, Gerry Thornley’s match report and all the reaction coming here. That’s a 14th Triple Crown for Ireland. MATCH SNYOPSIS: Ireland led 7-0, trailed 13-10 at half-time and 18-10 early in the second half, before Gibson-Park, Lowe and Osborne combined for the latter’s try and then Prendergast’s boot saw them home. Ringrose had a yellow card upgraded to a red card. Ireland win a Triple Crown. Performance was well below par, individually and collectively. To Ireland the spoils, including a Triple Crown but to Wales the plaudits in performance terms. Coming off a 14-match losing streak, that’s now gone to 15, and given very little hope but the home side was so courageous in defeat, playing some cracking attacking rugby to boot. Ireland will be relieved rather than happy. Finlay Bealham, Ryan Baird and Bundee Aki made a huge difference on their arrival. Full-time: Wales 18 Ireland 27 80 mins: Prendergast takes on long range penalty that drops short after Beirne won a ruck penalty. Wales with one last effort in chasing a bonus point. 77 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Great counter-ruck from Ireland led by van der Flier supported by Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle leads to a penalty. Henshaw and Baird with key tackles in the build-up. Prendergast is unerring. Gibson-Park announced as man of the match. No argument. Brilliant again. Conor Murray on at scrumhalf Wales 18 Ireland 27 75 mins: Gus McCarthy on for captain, Sheehan. Brilliant again from Osborne in tidying up. Wales 18 Ireland 24 72 mins: Brilliant response from Wales and Ellis Mee is deemed to have scored a try by referee Ridley. His on-field decision is try. Tempest the TMO is rocking and rolling the angle, I think his hand is in touch. 47 angles later. Knock-on. Hits short and it’s a knock-on. That’s unfortunate for Wales. Another superb passage of play in attack. Ireland are very, very lucky. Good work from Hansen, who’s now been replaced by Jack Crowley and Osborne. Boyle and Bealham win a scrum penalty. Crowley is on at fullback, Osborne moves to the wing. Wales 18 Ireland 24 Jack Boyle becomes the 12th St Michael’s College old boy to be capped at senior level by Ireland; 11 have been in the last decade. Michael’s capped players, year of debut and number of caps. 1984 - Derek McGrath (5) 2014 - Noel Reid (1) 2016 - Dan Leavy (11) *Luke McGrath (19) 2017 - Rory O’Loughlin (1) *James Ryan (70) 2018 - *Ross Byrne (22) 2020 - *Ronan Kelleher (39) *Max Deegan (2) 2021 - *Ryan Baird (25) *Harry Byrne (4) 2025 - *Jack Boyle (1) * - still active 69 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. A blood splattered Bundee Aki wins a penalty at a ruck, clamped on after Sheehan’s tackle. Prendergast is going to take it on. It’s two metres inside the Welsh half. The outhalf strikes it superbly. Gibson-Park with a brilliant relieving kick from the re-start. Jack Boyle is on for his debut. Wales 18 Ireland 24 68 mins: Porter is hit in the head by Thomas, referee thinks it’s chest. Ian Tempest agrees. NO further sanction. NO foul play. Wales 18 Ireland 21 64 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Wonderful catch and kick from Lowe. Ryan back on for McCarthy. Gibson-Park with a wonderful sniping break. Hansen denied a try, held up brilliantly by Murray and Morgan. Ireland were on penalty advantage. Hansen might have given Sheehan a scoring pass in hindsight. The Irish hooker and captain asks Prendergast to kick the penalty and the young outhalf bisects the posts. Wales 18 Ireland 21 62 mins: It’s another brilliant counter-attack from Wales who are playing without fear. Width to their attack, first instinct is to offload. Joe Roberts is on for try scorer Tom Rogers. Free-kick Ireland ats scrum, the first after Welsh loosehead Nicky Smith has gone off. Wales 18 Ireland 18 58 mins: Osborne has done superbly in the air for the most part. It’s been a superb post interval response from Easterby’s side. The one caveat is the discipline. 11 penalties now, the latest for a neck roll. Wales 18 Ireland 18 55 mins: TRY OSBORNE. That’s a great reaction from Ireland. On penalty advantage Ireland pack Sheehan, O’Mahony X2, Baird carry and Gibson-Park with a cross-kick with the boot is tapped back brilliantly by Lowe into the waiting arms of Osborne. Prendergast misses the conversion. It’s all tied up. Wales 18 Ireland 18 53 mins: Ireland have conceded nine penalties to date. Fantastic piece of skill from Prendergast, brilliant spiral for a 50/22 after great play from Osborne. Ireland deep inside the Welsh 22. Wales 18 Ireland 13 52 mins: Henry Thomas on for WillGriff John for Wales. McCarthy with a superb play. Ireland scrum. Anscombe off for a HIA. Jarrod Evans is on. No referee changes his mind. Penalty Wales. Wales 18 Ireland 13 50 mins: McCarthy is back on for Ryan having passed his HIA. Wales with some lovely running angles and offloading but Henshaw comes up with a brilliant turnover. Great line kick from Prendergast and Ireland are back up to 15 players, as Aki replaces Ringrose. Wales 18 Ireland 13 47 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Ireland win a scrum penalty inside the Welsh 22, more direct around the fringes, where there is space. Baird involved several times. Finlay Bealham on for Clarkson. Wales 18 Ireland 13 42 mins: ROGERS TRY. Ireland are panicky. Osborne kicks away possession, Sheehan gives away possession and it all ends in a try for TOM ROGERS. Flamboyant finish. Ireland again the architect of their downfall. Anscombe misses the conversion. Conan off with an injury. Ryan Baird, who didn’t expect to play today, is on. Wales 18 Ireland 10 Ireland will have to survive another 10-minutes a man down until Ringrose’s 20-minute red card is played out and they can bring on Bundee Aki. Referee Ridley confirms the red card ruling as the second half gets under way. “High degree of danger and no mitigation.” James Ryan is on for McCarthy (HIA) Okay, how to unpack that. Ireland conceded four scrum penalties, two against Porter, two against Clarkson. Apart from the opening 15-minutes, they have been very disjointed, dogged by basic mistakes, handling hasn’t been good and some of the decision making has been flawed too. They will rue that missed opportunity when Osborne’s pass to Ringrose went to turf as a try beckoned. That would have out them 17-3 up. Wales though deserve hue credit for the manner in which they have hung around and to be honest played the better attacking rugby. They’ve troubled Ireland particularly out wide. Ireland will need to be a lot more precise and composed in possession. They’ll need to sort out the scrum, be better disciplined and connected in attack and defence. The high point of the Irish half from an Irish perspective The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d RED CARD: Ireland’s Garry Ringrose’s yellow card has been upgraded to a 20-minute red card. Head on head contact on Ben Thomas. The correct decision. Needed to be lower. Half-time: Wales 13 Ireland 10 40(+2) mins: TRY Morgan. Wales on penalty advantage from the lineout after Ireland come in from the side at the maul; van der Flier pinged. Clarkson saved a try with a great tackle. Anscombe kicks the penalty to the corner. Rowlands takes, backs join maul. Wales pound the Irish line, stopped by millimetres until captain, Morgan forces his way over. Anscombe converts. Wales have deserved that. Wales 13 Ireland 10 36 mins: Prendergast hits an upright with a long-range penalty. Superbly struck but the outhalf then knocks on a high ball. Ireland are at sixes and sevens defensively, looking a little ragged on both sides of the ball and there are simply too many missed straight up tackles. Ireland concede a fourth scrum penalty. Leads to a schemozzle. Seven penalties Ireland have conceded, four at scrum time. Wales 6 Ireland 10 31 mins: Ireland are guilty of ball watching at a ruck. Van der Flier protects the ball, but no one goes in to move it on in the absence of Gibson-Park and Ireland penalised for holding on. Osborne with a superb tackle at Wales go on the attack again. They are inside the Irish 22. Ireland are penalised, Ringrose not rolling away. The television match official Ian Tempest advises the referee Christophe Ridley to look at a Ringrose tackle previously. Ringrose receives a yellow card and it will be reviewed by FPRO, Matteo Liperini (Italy). 34 mins: Anscombe kicks the penalty. Wales 6 Ireland 10 30 mins: Should have been a try for Ireland, great work by McCarthy and Peter O’Mahony in the build-up, the visitors sweep wide, but Osborne throws a poor pass. Ringrose was in for a walk in try, if the pass had gone to hand. A long pass was required but Osborne slapping the turf tells you he felt he should have done better. Smith is back in the front row. Scrum is completed. Wales 3 Ireland 10 27 mins: Good work from Ireland, good strike, Conan gets off the base of the scrum superbly and Lowe completes the clearance with his left foot. Wales though are back on the attack and they’re playing some lovely rugby. Wales 3 Ireland 10 24 mins: A poor enough re-start from Prendergast, too far and Tomos Williams with a superb clearance into the Irish half. Ireland kick away possession, Wales get it to the edge. Sheehan rescues his team by covering a kick through but Osborne doesn’t get much on the clearance. Brilliant work from Wales down the touchline but Williams knocks on what would have been a try scoring pass from Jac Morgan. That’s a huge let off for Ireland. Wales 3 Ireland 10 22 mins: Brilliant take from Beirne at the re-start, Sheehan knocked on though and Ireland are caught offside. Anscombe kicks the easy penalty. Wales 3 Ireland 10 19 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Gareth Thomas (Ospreys) on for Nicky Smith at loosehead prop. We’re about to have another scrum. Wales 3-0 up on penalties. What will the change do? Ireland win a scrum penalty. Thomas, the new boy penalised. Prendergast points at the posts and thumps it over. Wales 0 Ireland 10 15 mins: Lovely fluency from Ireland in attack, going from one touchline to the other. Move ends when Lowe goes through a gap but loses the ball in contact seven metres from the Welsh line. Wales win a third scrum penalty. Clarkson called again, this time by Gianluca Gnecchi, the other assistant referee. Worrying for Ireland. All three officials have called a scrum penalty against Ireland. Wales 0 Ireland 7 11 mins: Ireland are penalised at the second scrum, this time Thomas Clarkson for dropping his bind. Josh van der Flier reclaims an overthrow at a lineout. Hansen kicks through but Blair Murray rescues Wales and the home side clears. Good work from Lowe and Ringrose. Prendergast kicks the ball away. Wales 0 Ireland 7 8 mins: Good clearance from Jamison Gibson-Park from the re-start, Tom Rogers beats Jamie Osborne to Gareth Anscombe’s up and under. Wales get some continuity. The home side penalised, Elliot Dee for a tip tackle on a ruck clear-out. Tadhg Beirne inverted. Ireland clear but Henshaw knocks on from the long throw over the back. Wales 0 Ireland 7 6 mins: TRY Jack Conan. Superb from Conan, great power and a one-handed fend to stretch and reach over the Welsh line. Prendergast kicks the conversion. Wales 0 Ireland 7 5 mins: Good direct running from Ireland, Taulupe Faletau penalised two metres from his line. The visitors take it off the tail. Joe McCarthy great carry, James Lowe too. Wales 0 Ireland 0 4 mins: A bit of aerial tennis ends in a Welsh knock-on and the first scrum of the match. Collapses. Re-set. Andrew Porter penalised. Call came in from assistant referee Nika Amashukeli. Nothing in it. Ball had gone. Should have been play on. Jack Conan wins turnover. Mack Hansen counter-ruck. Garry Ringrose great grubber for a 50/22. Wales 0 Ireland 0 Ireland kickoff through Sam Prendergast. Roof closed, wonderful atmosphere, passionate rendition of the anthems. Let’s go.

Time for the anthems. Tommy Bowe knows a thing or two about Irish and Welsh rugby. What is the secret to Ireland's rugby success? 🤔@TommyBowe has his say 🗣️ #BBCRugby #SixNations pic.twitter.com/C0YdCVQPrL Right a little under half an hour to go to kickoff. Johnny Watterson will have green and red markers as he does the Player Ratings post match, Gerry Thornley will have his match report and I’ll keep you up to date with all the post match reaction. Stay here and all that will be coming your way on the blog. We will link everything to this blog. Statistics, the last refuge of the scoundrel. And I’d know. One that caught the eye was that Ireland had just 47% possession in their first two games – the second lowest after Italy (44%) – but they have enjoyed more territory (56%) than any other side and made more entries into the opposition 22 (22) than anyone else. Other reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective. Wales have conceded the most (26) and been awarded the fewest (14) penalties of any side in the Six Nations. We'll wear our new alternate white kit in Cardiff on Saturday to help supporters impacted by colour blindness! ⚪️#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/h1D22FiGck The reason that Ireland will wear their changed strip today. In a significant move to support spectators and viewers with colour vision deficiency (CVD), Ireland will wear their new alternate white kit against Wales. This decision, driven by new World Rugby regulations, aims to prevent kit clashes that can be problematic for those affected by CVD. Colour vision deficiency, commonly known as colour blindness, affects approximately one in 12 men and one in 200 women. The traditional red jerseys of Wales and the green jerseys of Ireland create a challenging visual scenario for those with CVD, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams on the pitch.

Referee: Christophe Ridley (England) Assistant Referees: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia), Gianluca Gnecchi (Italy) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Matteo Liperini (Italy) BREAKING NEWS: Cian Prendergast has had to withdraw from the Ireland bench because of illness and his place goes to Ryan Baird. That’s very unfortunate for the Connacht captain but Ireland are fortunate to have such an accomplished stand-in. A word from the coaches. Simon Easterby: “Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the great tests and we know the challenge that awaits us. “With a new coaching set-up in place, Wales will be re-energised and determined to impress in front of a vocal home support. “There will also be a huge Irish travelling support which, when added to the closed roof and the great respect and rivalry between the two nations, will add to an electric atmosphere.” He added: “We have made a few changes to the squad this week, some of which were enforced, and we’re confident that the 23 we have selected are primed and ready to go. “Dan’s (Sheehan) selection as captain is recognition of his high standing within the squad, both on and off the pitch. I have no doubt that he will relish the opportunity to lead Ireland for the first time. “Equally, I would also like to congratulate Jack Boyle on his inclusion in the matchday squad for the first time. Jack has impressed for his province Leinster, and in the national training camps over the last number of months, and he’s a young forward with a bright future.” Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt: “We’re looking forward to the challenge of facing Ireland. We have spoken this week about being brave, but not reckless and making sure everyone knows their roles. “We also know that keeping our discipline will be huge. Everyone is excited for our first home game of the Six Nations. “The atmosphere Wales fans create at the Principality Stadium is incredible, and playing at home is something the players really look forward to.” Love the sentiment behind this image.

C'mon @IrishRugby - you got this!#TeamOfUs #ShouldertoShoulder pic.twitter.com/RKZR9pBOMK For those of us who have been around a while (!) I remember the Triple Crowns of 1982 and 1985 - our 5th and 6th ever in history. Glory days ! Today we’ll be going for our 8th this century after 04, 06, 07, 09, 18, 22 & 23. @IrishRugby has come a long way …. Welsh Twitter is certainly going all-in on the victory of the Wales Under-20 side as a positive harbinger for this afternoon’s game at the Principality Stadium. I am half expecting to see them point to the fact that the Irish 20s and the senior side were/are in the changed white, and I use that description loosely, strip. Maybe it’s an omen. A little under an hour and a half to go to kickoff in Cardiff. Just enough time to grab a bite and a drink of choice and read Gerry Thornley’s preview Former Wales great Jonathan Davies things that the Welsh 20s can inspire their senior brethern. Great win for Wales U20s just the boost Welsh rugby needed. 👍💪👏👏👏 Time to rip the plaster off the Ireland Under-20s performance in the 20-12 defeat to Wales at Rodney Parade last night. Once again they dominated territory and possession but the same old failings came back to haunt them in the opposition 22, leaving behind oodles of points. To their credit Wales defended with courage and grit, making over 228 tackles to their opponents 67 but the visitors made that job easier with an attack that lacked shape and cohesion and a multitude of handling errors. Nathan Johns was in Newport and here’s his thoughts on Ireland’s shortcomings. The best of both worlds for one Welsh fan. About to make the long long drove to Monmouth services for a @GreggsOfficial And while I’m in the area i thought i might catch Wales playing Ireland in the #GuinnessM6N Say hi if you’re about! pic.twitter.com/S1EIYYQqlp Go well Ireland 🙌#SUAF ☘️ | @SixNationsRugby | #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/TGkgHmnghd The bookmakers have Ireland as 25-point favourites on the handicap for today’s game and offer Wales at 14/1 against on a straight bet, which is long, long, long odds in a two-horse race to mix sporting metaphors. However, the Irish side would do well to remember that the tournament has had some famous upsets in the past, starting on the opening weekend on the first ever Six Nations in 2000. Scotland, the defending Fix Nations champions, travelled to the Stadio Flaminio in Rome to face an Italian side playing their first ever game in the Six Nations and lost 34-20. Italy’s, Argentine born outhalf, Diego Dominguez kicked 29-points. Wales beat raging hot favourites England 31-30 at Wembley in 1999 to deny them a Grand Slam. A late try by Scott Gibbs gave Wales the win and Scotland the title on points’ difference. In 2019 Ireland had just toppled world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten series of matches in November and sat on a run of 12 home wins on the bounce and 18 victories from their past 19 games. England, the visitors, hadn’t scored a try in Ireland in eight years, so it was no wonder that Joe Schmidt’s men down as heavy favourites on the day. England, under Eddie Jones, cruised home 32-20 for only their second win in Dublin since 2003. Italy enjoyed two huge upset wins in Rome, the first in 2011 when the squeezed-out France 22-21 with Mirco Bergamasco the hero, while two years later it was Ireland that suffered a similar fate losing 22-15 in the last game of Declan Kidney’s tenure as head coach. When Scotland beat England 11-6 at Twickenham in 2021, they were 9/2 underdogs with their hosts 1/6 to win that match. England were the reigning champions and it was a first win for the Scots in 38 years at the London venue. Good news and bad news today. Bad news is I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Good news is… I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🤣 Come on boys 💪🙏🏉 #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Gpy9NIL9am Hello and welcome to the Irish Times blog for today’s Six Nations match at the Principality stadium. John O’Sullivan here and I’ll be taking you through the afternoon, before, during and after the game. We have some exclusive content too, not just what’s been on the website or in the newspaper. Will Wales get the big game bounce under new management with Cardiff coach Matt Sherratt taking over in an interim capacity following Warren Gatland’s departure, a decision based on mutual agreement between the New Zealander and the Welsh Rugby Union? The home supporters will be hoping that’s a fervent, ‘yes.’ Ireland are also under an interim coach, albeit in happier circumstances, in Simon Easterby, who is caretaking while Andy Farrell devotes himself to the British & Irish Lions head coach’s role. Not sure, when, if ever you would have had two countries facing one another in a Six Nations clash under interim head coaches. That’s not the only similarity. Wales and Ireland share a common identity prior to today’s match as the only two sides capable of winning the Triple Crown in this season’s Six Nations Championship. Ireland have safely negotiated two thirds of that remit with victories over England and Scotland, while for Wales this is the first leg of the treble with games against England and Scotland to come. Ireland take on Wales this afternoon as they look to keep their perfect start to this year’s Six Nations campaign going and claim the Triple Crown, although eyes are firmly set on the bigger prize with a third championship in a row and a grand slam within their sights. Simon Easterby has made seven changes to his side for the game with Dan Sheehan set to captain his country for the first time. Ireland come into the game as heavy favourites after the poor start Wales have had to the tournament and the departure of Warren Gatland.

Title: Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/02/22/g-s1-50098/germany-election-chancellor-parliament-afd

Rob Schmitz People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21. VOLKER HARTMANN/AFP via Getty Images hide caption BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election. The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%). The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government. "I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form," says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break." The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table. Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world. Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: "Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people," says Röttgen. "And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist." Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies. The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. "I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively," says Puglierin. "But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population." After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic. Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. "He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD," she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. "We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles," he says. "That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States." Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Berlin. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks about DeepSeek
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-thinks-deepseek-ai-q4-earnings-1851765905
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:37:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+4.56%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global selloff of tech stocks. In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+3.69%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is “fairly compute intensive.” “I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.” Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it. “It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said. Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+0.78%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

Title: Travel Startups Raise $580 Million Over Two Weeks

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else In the past two weeks, six travel startups have collectively raised $580 million, showcasing ongoing investor interest in travel technology advancements. Companies like Archer Aviation are leading the charge with significant funding aimed at developing flying taxis, with plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Klook and RoomPriceGenie are leveraging AI and automation to enhance travel experiences and hotel pricing, underscoring a shift towards modernizing traditional travel sectors. Tech companies promising to automate old industries are still getting big investment deals in 2025. Klook, which is modernizing the historically low-tech sector of ticketed experiences, just landed its second large fundraise in the past 18 months. And RoomPriceGenie, despite having several notable competitors, raised $75 million to help hotels automate pricing — an area that’s seen a lot of demand as hotels have been looking to modernize and generate more revenue since the pandemic. While startups developing flying taxis and renewable jet fuel are not producing much revenue yet, they’re raking in large amounts of money with the promise of big business in the future. Six travel startups raised nearly $580 million over the past two weeks. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for commercial flights and defense clients, has raised $301.8 million. Investors included funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The company has now raised over $2 billion, including its most recent deal of $430 million in December. The company said the latest fundraise brings its total liquidity to around $1 billion. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines, the company said. Archer said it now has manufacturing contracts worth over $6 billion. That includes a recent purchasing agreement for up to 100 aircrafts from Soracle — owned by Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation — which plans to operate a flying taxi service in various cities in Japan. The company recently unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles ahead of some major sporting events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027, and the Summer Olympics in 2028. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. The funding will go toward the continued development of the company’s aircraft. Klook, an online travel agency for tours and attractions, has raised $100 million The company said that the fundraise brings its valuation to over $1 billion for the first time. Vitruvian Partners led the round. The company last raised $210 million in equity and debt in 2023. Hong Kong-based Klook says it offers hundreds of thousands of ticketed experiences, such as walking tours, in 2,700 destinations globally. The company has also been expanding to offer hotels, trains, and car rentals. The new funding will go toward AI initiatives, such as for enhancing merchant operations, through an expanded partnership with Google Cloud. (See Skift’s story.) RoomPriceGenie, which provides AI-powered pricing tech for hotels, has raised $75 million. The funding comes from Five Elms Capital. Switzerland-based RoomPriceGenie provides a revenue management system for independent hotels and groups. The tech is meant to automate updating room rates based on changing market conditions. Competitors include Duetto, which was acquired by a private equity firm last year. The company says it has more than 3,000 hotel clients in 65 countries. The company also said it appointed Chas Scarantino as CEO. The co-founder and previous CEO, Ari Andricopoulos, is now the chief strategy officer. The funding will go toward expanding internally. Twelve, a renewable jet fuel production startup, has raised $83 million. Investors included DCVC, Amazon (The Climate Pledge Fund), Mitsui & Co., Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, Greycroft (Coca-Cola Sustainability Fund), 2551 Capital, SMBC, TPG, Pulse Fund, and others. The company most recently raised a series C round of $200 million in September. The new funding is a mix between an extension of the series C round plus financing to build a production facility. California-based Twelve says its tech generates jet fuel by converting a mix of carbon dioxide from either tanks or the atmosphere, along with water and renewable energy. Airline customers so far include Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways. Superlogic, which helps users apply loyalty points to ticketed experiences, has raised $13.7 million in its series A funding. Superlogic, a trailblazer in experiential rewards technology, today announced a first closing of $13.7 million in its Series A funding round. Led by Powerledger led the round, with support from including Sangha Capital, 10SQ, Nima Capital, Actai Unicorn Fund, Hyla Liquid Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Amex Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation, Recharge Capital, Dispersion Capital, Sanctor Capital, and more. Miami-based Superlogic provides an AI-powered platform that loyalty programs can use to connect users with experiences tailored to their interests. Spark e-Fuels, which is developing tech to make renewable jet fuel, has raised $2.4 million (€2.3 million) in pre-seed funding. Nucleus Capital led the round, with support from Zero Carbon Capital, IBB Ventures, Chemovator, Voyagers.io, 1.5° Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Spark is focused on building its first e-fuel pilot plant and expanding its team to accelerate technology development and commercialization. The Berlin-based startup is developing tech that converts renewable resources like carbon dioxide, into jet fuel. The funding will go toward building its first pilot production plant and hiring.

Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/coinbase-ceos-hot-take-bitcoin-is-basically-a-meme-coin/
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Target is facing another big DEI lawsuit

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:44:00Z
Full Content:
Target (TGT-1.96%) was hit with another lawsuit on Thursday, this time by the state of Florida, which accused the retail giant of hiding the risks tied to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The state claims these initiatives sparked a customer backlash that erased billions of dollars from Target’s market value. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was brought by the State Board of Administration of Florida, an agency responsible for managing public pension funds, which hold Target stock. Florida alleges that Target misled investors and alienated its core customer base by making false and misleading statements in its financial reports about its DEI and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. The lawsuit also targets Target CEO Brian Cornell, accusing him of downplaying the scope of customer boycotts following the company’s Pride Month campaign in May 2023. The state claims these boycotts contributed to a prolonged decline in Target’s share price. Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is being represented by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and America First Legal, a group led by President Donald Trump’s advisor, Stephen Miller. “Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre.” This is America First Legal’s second lawsuit against Target. Earlier this month, the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida filed a similar lawsuit. The legal actions come as Target, along with other major corporations such as Walmart (WMT-0.03%), McDonald’s (MCD-0.69%), and Meta (META+3.69%), have recently scaled back their DEI initiatives.

Title: Jensen Huang Donates a Lifeline to San Francisco’s Last Nonprofit Arts College

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:37:16Z

David Howse, president of the California College of the Arts (CCA), delivered grim news last summer to his faculty and students: given rapidly declining enrollment, the college’s future was in serious peril. Less than a year later, the nonprofit arts college has received a lifeline thanks to the philanthropy of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Jen-Hsun (Jensen Huang’s Chinese name) and Lori Huang Foundation, founded by Huang and his wife nearly two decades ago, is donating a staggering $22.5 million to the San Francisco-based school—the largest gift in its history. The donation matches additional funds raised from other individuals and entities connected to either the college or local arts and tech communities, giving the CCA a total of nearly $45 million to address its financial struggles. Huang’s foundation “saw an opportunity both to support CCA in this time of need and also to challenge others to rise to the moment,” said Howse in a statement. Like other nonprofit arts colleges across the U.S., CCA has faced mounting challenges in recent years amid a dramatic drop-off in enrollment exacerbated by demographic factors and the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the school announced a series of cost-cutting measures, such as layoffs, as it faced a $20 million deficit. Besides addressing its deficit, CCA said its new funds will be earmarked for program launches and future fundraising opportunities. The school was founded more than a century ago and focuses primarily on art, architecture, design and writing; offering 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate programs. Huang is currently the world’s 11th richest person with an estimated net worth of $121.8 billion—an achievement enabled largely by Nvidia’s dominance in today’s A.I. boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a rare commodity amongst tech developers scrambling to power their A.I. products, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL) pouring billions of dollars into Nvidia’s sought-after hardware. While the bulk of the Huang Foundation’s donations have been funneled into donor-advised funds, a type of philanthropic savings account utilized by the wealthy, the nonprofit has also supported a number of educational institutions over the years. In 2023, for example, it gave $10 million to Oregon State University (OSU), which both Huang and his wife Lori attended. The couple previously pledged $50 million to their alma mater in 2022 to build a supercomputing complex. And in 2008, they gave $30 million to help establish an engineering center at Stanford, where Huang received a degree in electrical engineering back in 1992. The billionaire’s donations have additionally benefited the Oneida Baptist Institute, a Kentucky boarding school he attended that received $2 million from Huang in 2019. While CCA isn’t one of the Nvidia founder’s alma maters, the art school’s alumni are well-connected across Silicon Valley. Graduates are frequently pursued by the likes of Google and Apple (AAPL), according to the school. Huang’s foundation “recognizes the essential intersection of technology, art and design in driving innovation,” said Eric Jensen, chief operating officer of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, in a statement. “Our investment in CCA reflects our commitment to supporting institutions that cultivate the creative leaders of tomorrow.” Huang isn’t the only tech billionaire injecting capital into arts education across Silicon Valley. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, led a nonprofit’s acquisition of the San Francisco Art Institute last year. The school, which will now house an artist residency program, went bankrupt in 2023—making CCA San Francisco’s last standing nonprofit arts college.

Title: The Ozempic shortage is over

The shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.06%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+1.50%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS+8.05%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’” In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved. The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.

Title: The best trade in the market might be following everything Elon Musk touches
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/best-trade-biggest-returns-might-musk-trade-not-trump-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-21T14:18:29Z
Full Content:
Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market. In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade. Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump. Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists. Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block. But first, Musk is having a moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk. In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.) You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump. But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart. Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7. The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period. Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks. While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly. There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman. A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.) More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be "unfair" to the US. Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country. And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform. In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them. BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference. 1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans. 2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday. 3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods. 1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements," per a SEC filing. 2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies. 3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval. 1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion. 2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: "Who'd you pick as the next Bond?" 3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

Marlow/Saslove & Warwick at Douglas Elliman Real Estate) That Aspen is Colorado’s ritziest housing market has long been a given and last year was no exception — Pitkin County claimed nine out of the 10 most expensive home sales in the state. But a sale that broke the $100 million threshold for the first time in state history helped the town dominate the charts nationally.The second quarter of 2024 was especially notable, with half of the 10 most expensive home sales recorded in the country happening in Aspen, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. For the year, Colorado claimed three of the top 10 sales where a public record was available.“When I moved to Aspen 30 years ago, we were a town of millionaires, not billionaires. Now we are a town of billionaires,” said Brenda Wild, an owner broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Aspen.Casino mogul Steve Wynn, founder of The Bellagio in Las Vegas, and online stock trading pioneer Thomas Petterfy, teamed up to purchase 419 Willoughby Way in Aspen for $108 million on April 15. The home, the largest on the top 10 list at a commanding 22,405 square feet, is on a street that has earned the title of Colorado’s billionaire row.The property at 720 Willoughby Way in Aspen, Colorado, sold for $60 million in 2024. (Provided by Mandy Welgos)In the neighborhood was the state’s fourth most expensive sale last year at $60 million — 720 Willoughby Way. Four years earlier that same home had sold for $27 million, a common acceleration in value among the top-priced sellers.The desire to get away and claim more space during the pandemic contributed to a run-up in prices in several resort areas. Pitkin County added to the frenzy when it limited the size of new homes to 9,250 square feet, helping make the mega-mansions built in prior decades collectibles for the rich and famous.Wild said the uber-wealthy view Aspen real estate as an asset class where they can park their money and earn a steady return. The location offers a getaway where they can isolate and disappear off the grid if they want or rub shoulders with other shakers and movers on the slopes or at different festivals.“Aspen has the full package and people are coming from all over the world, all the time,” she said. Measured on a per-square-foot basis, the most expensive home on the list was 850 Roaring Fork Road. It went for $7,901 a square foot, which compares to $4,820 a square foot for 419 Willoughby.Outside of Aspen, only Vail managed to sneak a home onto the state’s top 10 list. That was the $40 million sale of 107 Rockledge Road, a 12,447-square-foot property that looks down on Vail Village and has direct access to the slopes.“It was the highest sales price for a single-family home that we have ever had,” said Liz Leeds, who specializes in luxury home sales in both Aspen and Vail. “Vail commands high prices, but not at the same level as what Aspen is doing.” Vail falls more in the price range of corporate executives and high-paid professionals who can’t afford Aspen, Leeds said.

Title: Shake Shack's CEO said the cost of eggs will likely drive up demand for beef and chicken

Shake Shack's CEO, Rob Lynch, says food chains will likely introduce more chicken and beef menu items as the price of eggs soars. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Lynch discussed the impact of tariffs and imports on the burger chain's business. Lynch said the company sources the majority of its ingredients domestically and won't have major exposure to tariffs. Thanks to its menu, it is largely insulated from the skyrocketing price of eggs as well. "I mean we don't have a breakfast business, a big breakfast business. So we don't have the exposure to eggs," Lynch said. "But other restaurant companies that have exposure to eggs may be moving away from eggs in the time being, which means they are going to offer more beef products or chicken products to complement, to substitute for that high-cost item," he said. Shake Shack is known for its beef, chicken, and mushroom burgers, as well as its fries and frozen custard shakes. While eggs don't play heavily into its menu, fast food giants from Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell to McDonald's and Burger King rely on eggs for some of their popular breakfast menu items. Lynch's comments come as egg prices in the US soar. Prices increased by 15.2% from December to January, the largest monthly spike in 10 years. In January, the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in the country hit an all-time high of $4.95. The surge was caused due to supply chain issues stemming from a H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US. The flu has forced farmers to cull infected birds, leading to egg shortages. Chains like Costco have seen egg cartons fly off their shelves minutes after store openings. Grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Costco have imposed limits on the number of cartons each customer can purchase. Earlier this month, Waffle House started adding a 50-cent surcharge to each egg it sells. Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog kiosk in New York City's Madison Square Park in 2004, has over 570 locations worldwide, including more than 370 outlets in the US. The chain posted a total quarterly revenue of $329 million, up 14.8% from the same quarter in 2023. This included $317 million of company-operated sales and about $12 million from licensing revenue. The company's stock was up 11% at market close on Thursday. It's up more than 27% in the past year. Representatives for Shake Shack did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Title: Cameo is giving workers a $10,000 raise to return to the office. Its CEO says they're paying more because they're asking for more.

Full Content:
The celebrity video messaging company Cameo this week rolled out $10,000 raises for employees returning to work in-office four days a week at its Chicago headquarters. CEO Steven Galanis told Business Insider the raises and other perks announced this week — such as catered lunch, paid parking, and a free gym membership — have immediately boosted productivity and recruitment efforts. Chicago-based workers all attended the first four required days in office without absences, they completed more sales outreach together in just a few days than they had in the previous six months, and the move has helped them recruit new employees, he said. "It's been pretty amazing to watch the reception that we've seen from applicants," Galanis said. "People are coming out of the woodwork that want to work for us now, and ex-employees want to come back, which is awesome." Cameo, which has gone through three rounds of highly publicized and contentious layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic, now employs 50 people, with about half living in the Chicago area, Galanis said. Those who don't live within commuting distance of Chicago aren't eligible for the raise unless they move there, and will not be required to report to the office, he said. If Cameo sets up satellite locations in other cities in the future, Galanis said the option for an in-office work raise would apply to them, as well. Galanis said he believes the company thrives on in-office brainstorming and participation, but he wanted to try to lure his workers back into the company headquarters organically. "We really wanted this to be a FOMO-inducing perk versus a punishment," Galanis said."I believe if we're requiring you to come in four days a week, we are literally asking more out of you than if you didn't have to. So, to me, if we're asking more out of you, it totally makes sense that we should pay you more." The $10,000 raise stands in contrast to other companies' RTO mandates, though Galanis said he has a preference for in-office collaboration shared by many top executives. JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, last week made headlines for a viral, expletive-laden rant against working from home. In it, he said he didn't care how many of the banking giant's employees signed a petition against its five-day return-to-office mandate that takes effect next month. "Don't waste time on it," Dimon said. "I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition." Other major companies, such as Starbucks, have threatened employees with termination if they refuse to comply with RTO orders, Bloomberg first reported in October. Still, some major return-to-office rollouts have been bumpy. As Business Insider previously reported, Amazon delayed its RTO initiative for some employees because it didn't have enough workspace for returning employees. Galanis said he understands the vitriol over working from home espoused by some executives — "what Jamie said is something that myself and many other CEOs have felt before or talked about behind closed doors," he said — and he gets the need for some extra large companies to be more strict in their approach to returning to the office. That just wasn't for him, he said. "I can't judge what's the right thing for another company's culture," Galanis said. "But I know the way our company is, and I know how much we cherish our employees and so this, for us, was the right approach." Jump to

February 20, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
