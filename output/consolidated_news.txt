The MACH-TB program, overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), is a cornerstone of the National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0. Its mission is to establish an affordable test bed that bridges the gap between ground-based hypersonic testing and full-scale flight tests. MACH-TB 2.0 aims to expand the nation's hypersonic flight testing capacity with a cost-effective and scalable approach. Under Task Area 1, Kratos holds the prime role in Systems Engineering, Integration, and Testing (SEIT). The company will manage subscale and full-scale systems and provide air launch services to address the growing demand for frequent hypersonic flight tests. Rocket Lab will support the Kratos-led team by offering systems engineering, assembly, integration, and testing (AI&T), as well as mission planning and launch services. Rocket Lab's involvement builds on its proven track record with the MACH-TB program. The company has conducted multiple successful hypersonic test launches using its HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) rocket. These launches took place at Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 2 in Wallops, Virginia. HASTE, a suborbital variant of the Electron launch vehicle, incorporates advanced technology such as carbon fiber composite structures and 3D-printed engines. It also features a modified Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic testing and offers a larger payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Rocket Lab's Vice President of Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, stated: "We're thrilled to be part of the Kratos-led team for the next iteration of the MACH-TB program and ready to serve the U.S. Department of Defense with even more high-cadence hypersonic technology with our HASTE launch vehicle. Our demonstrated ability to date to deliver successful HASTE launches that test these new technologies is testament to our dedication in advancing hypersonic innovation for the nation alongside our government and industry partners." To date, Rocket Lab's Electron and HASTE vehicles have successfully deployed over 200 payloads from launch sites in the United States and New Zealand, highlighting the company's expertise and reliability in both orbital and suborbital missions.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter.

Title: The Best Of 2024 From AI Stock Analyst

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered. To refer my newsletter to your friends and family, please click here. In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered. To refer my newsletter to your friends and family, please click here. In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Title: Where Should Your Money Be In 2025?

Financial Planning for new year 2025 As 2025 gains momentum, you may be thinking about your investment portfolio. Where will the opportunities lie in the new year? As I’ve noted in the past, investors are once again faced with a landscape of opportunities and risks shaped by macroeconomic trends, evolving consumer behavior, and technological innovation—much of which has little to no historical precedent. While there are some solid stock options and interesting alternatives, looking farther afield for investment opportunities can be difficult. If you’re unsure what to do with your money in the months ahead, here are some high-level insights into where some of the most important industries stand and how they may fare in the upcoming year. The multifamily housing sector continues to show resilience, bolstered by strong demand for rental properties. “As the financial hurdles of buying a home persist and interest rates plateau, multifamily housing is emerging as the clear choice for many,” notes Chuck Bryant, Jr., COO of Roial Group, an investment firm focused on affordable multifamily housing. “This surge in rental demand, alongside strong economic conditions, highlight the enduring strength of multifamily investments.” “The U.S. faces a critical shortage of affordable rental housing,” Bryant emphasizes, “with only 33 units available for every 100 extremely low-income households.” Other data backs up this statistic. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, the U.S. needs to build 4.3 million new apartments by 2035 to meet demand. This shortfall is driven by rising housing prices, a shift in consumer preferences toward renting, and demographic trends such as delayed homeownership among millennials and Gen Z. “This persistent gap,” says Bryant, “ensures steady demand, making affordable housing a stable and impactful investment opportunity for 2024 and beyond." For those who wish to have exposure to multifamily real estate without managing their own properties, multifamily real estate investment trusts could be a solution. For 2025, REITs are poised to benefit from a strong rental market, especially in high-demand urban and suburban areas. However, investors should stay up to date on other factors. Rising interest rates, for instance, could pose challenges for new developments, increasing borrowing costs and potentially slowing construction activity. Technology remains a cornerstone of modern portfolios, with artificial intelligence and cloud computing serving as key growth drivers. Gartner estimates that global spending on AI systems will explode over the next few years, growing at around 19.1% annually through 2027. Companies like Nvidia, which dominates the AI chip market, and Microsoft, a leader in cloud services, are at the forefront of this transformation. They remain solid investment options as this initial AI investment run plays out in the coming years. The semiconductor industry is another area to watch. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 has incentivized domestic semiconductor production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This move is expected to bolster companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, investors should remain cautious about valuations. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has rebounded significantly in 2024, leading to concerns about overvaluation. Don’t overcommit here. The energy sector presents a mixed outlook, with oil and gas facing headwinds and alternative energy gaining momentum. On the traditional side, the International Energy Agency predicts that global oil demand will plateau by 2030, but short-term disruptions could drive prices higher in 2025. Geopolitical tensions and production cuts by OPEC+ have already led to price spikes in 2024, creating opportunities for companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. Alternative energy, however, is where growth potential truly lies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated $369 billion toward clean energy projects, sparking a surge in investment. Solar power alone is expected to account for 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “The ‘electrification of everything’ is more than just the most important macro tailwind for renewables,” says Glenn Jacobson, Managing Partner at Greenbelt Capital, a private equity leader in the energy sector. “It’s reshaping the entire energy landscape, as well as the computer, transportation, and industrial sectors. This shift represents a massive structural transformation, driving unprecedented demand for clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions.” Jacobson narrows his prediction to a combination of production and growth, saying, “I’m most bullish on solar and solar-plus-storage, both at the grid-scale and distributed levels, due to their unmatched economics. However, we’re set to see broad-based capacity growth across multiple energy sources. This expansion will go hand-in-hand with massive grid infrastructure investments as the market adjusts to a generational surge in both energy supply and electricity demand.” Solar has been a long-term investment option for years. Don’t expect it to lose its luster in 2025. The retail sector is navigating a complex environment characterized by shifting consumer preferences and economic pressures. E-commerce continues to expand, with online sales projected to grow by 8.6% in 2025, according to Oberlo. Amazon (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP) remain dominant players. However, niche platforms catering to specific demographics are also gaining traction. Brick-and-mortar retail, on the other hand, is undergoing a transformation. Experiential retail, which focuses on creating unique in-store experiences, is gaining popularity. Companies like Lululemon (LULU) and RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) have embraced this trend and delivered strong financial performance. However, like real estate interest rates, inflation poses a significant challenge for the retail sector. Rising costs for goods and services could dampen consumer spending, particularly in discretionary categories. Retailers with robust pricing power and strong brand loyalty are better equipped to navigate this environment. The healthcare sector remains a front-line area of innovation. It continues to offer a compelling case for long-term investment driven by demographic trends and technological advancements. The aging global population is increasing the demand for healthcare services, while breakthroughs in biotechnology and medical devices are creating new opportunities. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) continue to invest in vaccine development and gene therapies. Meanwhile, medical device companies such as Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are innovating in areas like minimally invasive surgery and cardiovascular health. Healthcare REITs, which focus on properties like senior living facilities and medical offices, also present a stable investment option. With a projected annual growth rate of 5.6% per year for healthcare expenditures through 2032, according to data shared by Becker’s Hospital CFO Report, the sector is poised for sustained growth. Investing may be an old concept, but it’s never looked like it does right now. Technology, economics, culture, politics, globalization, and countless other elements are influencing the investment landscape like never before. It’s important to consider where your money should go in 2025, and the real estate, tech, energy, retail, and healthcare sectors remain leading options for the months ahead. One Community.

By Suzanne McGee and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. "We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period," wrote Ben Tecmire, head of U.S. regulatory affairs at BlackRock, in the letter to the FDIC. That is especially true, he added, since "all the banks that would be covered by your proposed agreement with BlackRock are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve." In the letter, Tecmire said BlackRock wants to avoid "inconsistent and uncertain requirements" that might result from the firm's bank holdings being overseen by multiple bank regulators. He said in the letter that BlackRock's understanding is that the agreement between the FDIC and Vanguard was reached only after several months of negotiation. An individual familiar with the matter said BlackRock's attempts in the final months of 2024 to meet with FDIC officials had been rebuffed. The FDIC did not respond to a request for comment on the letter or the negotiations. GETTING TOO BIG? BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) now collectively control some $26 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis of 2009 investors have poured money into their low-cost index funds, catapulting the three firms into the ranks of the largest owners of most large U.S. corporations. But their size and clout have raised worries the holdings could diminish competition among the companies they commonly own. Even Vanguard's late founder Jack Bogle voiced concern. Because of the firms' influence on corporate governance, they also have faced political attacks on issues like their treatment of greenhouse gas emissions or workforce diversity. On Thursday, BlackRock said it plans to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. So far academic studies paint a mixed picture. A 2023 U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta review for example, found "relatively little evidence" of such problems. Some of the issues the FDIC is grappling with now have also been hashed out in front of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Trade group Edison Electric Institute cautioned the FERC that its actions have the potential to hamper or delay much-needed capital investments. However, FERC has moved at a much slower pace to consider challenges to the big stakes that the passive funds own in major utilities. One objection is that new limits by regulators could divert investments away from portfolio companies, be they banks or utility firms. Jeff DeMaso, who writes a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said via e-mail that regulators should "tread lightly" before putting new limits on passive mutual funds or ETFs. "We are trying to sort through the unintended consequences of indexing and the concentration of ownership. Before (potentially) damaging that clear good, we should clearly know the problem we are solving," he said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:RELY) is a financial services company that allows people to send and receive money online from the United States. The company has a motive to help immigrants in the United States support their families back home, enhancing the sentimental value associated with the brand. In addition to that, the company also funds charities and programs to enhance the financial and social position of immigrants in the United States and their families. Over the years, the company has expanded to Europe, partnered with prominent names, and urged state organizations to enhance the financial and social inclusion of immigrants. Aligning with its goals, Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) is leveraging machine learning to prevent fraud and minimize interventions. The company uses ML models to assess and detect thousands of transactions every hour, allowing them to prevent identity theft and credit card fraud with precision. In 2023, the company has been able to reduce the rate of fraud by more than 25% compared to 2022. At the same time, the company saw a 30% decline in its rate of transaction loss. Similarly, on December 10, the company launched a Trust and Safety Center in partnership with Get Safe Online to educate users on fraud and scams online. Investors are bullish on the stock because of its fundamentals, expanding market share, and a solid growth trajectory. Night Watch Investment Management stated the following regarding Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “The US consumer has been in a 2-year affordability crisis. As a result, there are many quality consumer businesses available at very attractive prices. However, we don’t currently see a reason why US consumer spending should rebound from its current depressed level. We will therefore limit ourselves to companies with company-specific growth drivers. An example is Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) which we acquired around $13 after the stock sold off excessively on an earnings miss in Q1, despite the 30% growth on the back of market share gains. Valuation is very attractive when considering that marketing expenses are a discretionary reinvestment into the business.” Overall RELY ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of RELY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RELY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock drops out of progressive ‘Net Zero’ initiative as pressure grows to ditch ‘woke’ groups

BlackRock is officially out of the so-called “Net Zero” coalition of top corporations who pledge to reach zero-carbon emissions by 2050 – a significant blow to the corporate push to embrace progressive policies on energy conservation, On The Money has learned. The investment giant, led by billionaire CEO Larry Fink, announced in a letter to clients on Thursday that it is leaving the United Nations-sponsored “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative” as pressure grows on big corporations to reverse their woke business agendas. BlackRock said its “involvement in organizations where various companies pledge efforts to reduce carbon emissions subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials. Following our routine review of our continued participation in these groups, we are writing to notify of our formal withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative,” according to the letter, which was obtained by On The Money. On The Money reported earlier this week that Fink was poised to leave the Net Zero Initiative. The exit comes as others have announced plans to leave a sister UN coalition for mega banks. In recent days, the nation’s largest banks – JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – said they are dropping their membership from the UN climate coalition. BlackRock’s departure is more significant. The world’s largest investment fund, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management, was a leader in so-called ESG, or Environmental Social Governance investing. Fink and other top executives had evangelized on the need to use the company’s investing might to force corporations to reduce their carbon footprint, joining Net Zero in 2021. But soon thereafter, a swift political backlash developed; sustainable energy investing faced stiff opposition from GOP politicians who ran large state pension funds in red states such as Texas and Florida. Rising inflation came after the COVID lockdowns ended, and higher gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made sustainability efforts politically toxic.

Members of Congress even suggested that the NetZero Alliance violated antitrust laws since it forced corporations to operate in concert to achieve what they called dubious aims of climate sustainability while causing working class people to suffer.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks. On January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management's chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%. Discussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth. Lip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range. Lip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we're here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. To identify the best long-term tech stocks according to media, we sifted through financial media reports and watched Wall Street analysts' appearances on the news. We compiled a preliminary list of 25 stocks first and then selected 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watches, and AirPods. It has a loyal customer base, and its subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+, are experiencing significant growth. While China has historically been a significant market for the company, it experienced a 7.7% year-over-year sales decline in FY24. India, on the other hand, achieved record revenue in FQ4 2024. Despite headwinds, its strong brand loyalty and continuous innovation efforts position it well for long-term growth. Apple's Services revenue reached an all-time high of $25 billion in FQ4 2024, a 12% year-over-year increase, particularly attributed to the App Store. This diversification lessens its dependence on hardware sales. Still, the launch of the iPhone 16, with its AI-powered features, is anticipated to fuel significant demand. Analysts project 90 million units of the iPhone 16 to be sold in 2025. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed AAPL stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here's what is said regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company’s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple’s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.” Overall AAPL ranks 7th on our list of the best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Exits Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative

Time Published: 2025-01-09T21:11:29Z

BlackRock will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, an investor group committed to achieving net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management, a spokesperson for BlackRock confirmed to CIO. The initiative counts more than 325 signatories representing $57.5 trillion in AUM. BlackRock joined the NZAM initiative in March 2021. In the firm’s 2030 net-zero statement, BlackRock anticipates at least 75% of its client assets under management to be invested in “issuers with science-based targets or equivalent.” “We are disappointed to see any investor withdraw, but as a voluntary initiative, we respect any individual decisions signatories take,” a spokesperson for the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative said via email. “Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realize the benefits of the economic transition to net zero.” The exit comes as similar climate investing groups have seen scores of members leave. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance has seen nearly all major U.S. banks, including JPMorganChase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs leave the initiative.

Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The Climate Action 100+ investor network had also had dozens of high-profile departures, including State Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, PIMCO, Franklin Templeton, Nuveen and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, among others. A pushback against environmental, social and governance-based investing and principles is likely to blame for the exodus. Opponents of ESG investing, including many Republicans in Congress and state-elected officials, say the focus of investment managers should be to maximize returns on their investments and that such ESG targets are not aligned with fiduciary duty to their clients. This view has led to a number of states banning their public funds from making ESG investments. In December, the Ohio Legislature banned pension fund and university endowments in the state from making “investment decisions with the primary purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy or attempting to influence the governance of any corporation.” The legislation also bans funds from engaging in shareholder activism. BlackRock has been a frequent target by Republican politicians over what the politicians say is an overcommitment to ESG. A number of states have divested from BlackRock over these concerns, including Texas and the Texas Permanent School Fund, which divested $8.5 billion in assets from the firm. In December, 11 states filed a complaint against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, accusing the trio of conspiring to suppress the coal market through their significant ownership of coal stocks. That complaint also cited the three firms being signatories to the NZAM initiative and accused the trio of pursuing ESG strategies in non-ESG funds. Last month, BlackRock was terminated as a nearly $1 billion fixed-income manager by the $46 billion Indiana Public Retirement System; under Indiana law, state pension funds cannot invest in managers or service providers determined to have made an ESG commitment. BlackRock’s status as a signatory to the NZAM initiative was cited by Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott as such a commitment. “NZAM has successfully helped raise the level of ambition across investors globally and supported their progress as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths toward a decarbonizing economy in line with their long-term financial objectives and fiduciary duties,” the NZAM spokesperson said. “We look forward to continuing to play this constructive role.” Related Stories: Vanguard Withdraws from Net Zero Group After State Pressure Institutional Investors Reaffirm Support for Climate Action 100+ Following Departures Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock Tags: BlackRock, ESG, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAM « Northwestern Mutual to Take Stake in Sixth Street, Form Investment Partnership

Title: Is Visa Inc. (V) the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. Both conservative and risk-tolerant investors favor blue chip stocks due to their solid business models, impressive track records, and attractive risk-reward profiles. These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions. In recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The “Magnificent 7” stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains. READ ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds. The trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025. “The Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,” he said earlier this month. “These companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won’t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.” Valuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however. “The Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They’re generating “tremendous” revenue for investors”, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. “How much more gain can be made is the question,” he added. Therefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It’s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that’s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy. To make our list of the 10 best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025, we analyzed the market, focusing on large market cap companies (more than $100 billion) with well-established, financially sound businesses. We then examined their performance over the past year, focusing on the underlying fundamentals that make them stand out. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their 12-month return in 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a credit card being swiped on a payment terminal, reflecting the company's payments technology. Market Cap as of January 8: $605.34 Billion Past Year Gain (2024): 19% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a payment technology company that offers VisaNet, a transaction processing network that enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions. While the company operates in a highly cyclical sector susceptible to varying economic conditions, its stock has remained resilient. The competitive edge stems from the company’s focus on payment facilitation and operating the world’s biggest credit card network. It collaborates with 14,500 financial institution partners and powers 4.5 billion cards globally. The massive network allowed the company to process almost $16 trillion in payments last year. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) generates significant revenues in fees regardless of prevailing economic conditions. In contrast, its other peers that engage in lending suffer immensely during recessions on having to cover for loan losses and delinquencies. Additionally, Visa’s edge stems from expanding its footprint across the globe. It remains one of the best blue chip stocks to buy, as the company has enjoyed sustained double-digit growth in cross-border volume in emerging markets. Since going public in 2008, the company has distributed dividends. It currently distributes a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, translating to a 0.73% yield. Although the yield might not seem impressive, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has a solid dividend-raising history, 15 years and counting. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Montaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. Overall, V ranks 9th on our list of best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia's Jensen Huang is "dead wrong" about quantum computers, D-Wave CEO says

D-wave’s market cap went up 10X in six weeks of November and December It merely shows how willing “the market,” and all its investment funds and speculators, are still willing to throw money at any new “tech” concept. Which is not to say that there is not going to be research using powerful quantum computers being used to solve specialized problems in the near term. In fact, that is already happening. We are nowhere near that point yet. In fact, that is already happening. We are nowhere near that point yet.

It doesn’t sound like it is ready for general use any time soon! One decade at most. This isn’t fusion energy. Huang is wrong and I own NVDA but may be cutting back based on what looks like desperate talk. Quantum computing hardware, albeit primitive, exists and the concept has been proven by Google. Using Moore’s Law (doesn’t really apply here though) and AI helping with design will bring about practical quantum computing way before decades pass. One remark from the CEO of Nvidia and all the Quantum Computing stock prices came crashing! How about that? It is still ambiguously theoretical He’s dead wrong about “AI agents” too, and LLMs in general. He is in many ways a snake oil salesman. But most people know little about AI, so think he is a prophet. He is just a chip salesman. Two of my friends died before their blue LED stock was worth anything. Big financial firms have been throwing money at quantum computing for more than 5 years. There is certainly interest in the practical concept of its application to make money. This from being there and getting previews of practical applications that are publicly acknowledged. I could only speculate on what they haven’t disclosed.

Title: Private Lenders Set to Take Over Alacrity in Debt Restructuring

Time Published: 2025-01-09T20:51:15Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Direct lenders including Antares Capital, Blue Owl Capital Inc and KKR & Co are preparing to take over insurance claims manager Alacrity Solutions, the latest restructuring in the private credit market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. BlackRock Inc. is set to hand over control of the company to its lenders less than two years after it purchased a 70% majority stake in the firm from Kohlberg & Co., said the people who asked not to be identified as the details are private. BlackRock’s existing equity investment will be completely wiped out, the people said, adding the firm invested about $560 million in equity at the time through its Long Term Private Capital strategy. Alacrity’s debt load, which was already in place when BlackRock purchased the stake, includes a roughly $1 billion unitranche from direct lenders and a more than $500 million junior capital piece from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the people said. Alacrity, which handles insurance claims through a network of adjusters, struggled as weather-related claims dwindled, Bloomberg reported. More insurance companies have also brought adjusting services in-house, curtailing the company’s client base. Now, those same lenders are ready to become the owners. First-lien holders will end up owning around 90% of the company under the restructuring plan, while the junior-capital provider GSAM will get the remaining piece, the people said. Antares, Blue Owl, KKR and the other lenders will convert about half of their loan into equity, while also providing about $175 million of new debt in the form of a revolving credit facility and a delayed-draw term loan, they said. Alacrity’s capital structure will include an about $450 million term loan and $250 million of preferred equity. Alacrity said it’s in a new financing accord with existing financial partners in a press release. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, while operations will remain unaffected in the interim, according to the statement. An Alacrity spokesperson declined to provide further details on the financing. Representatives for Antares, BlackRock, Blue Owl and GSAM declined to comment. KKR didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the additional financing details, but had declined to comment on the deal previously. It’s the latest large restructuring to come to light in the private credit world in the past 12 months, as companies continue to grapple with higher rates and private credit managers struggle to stay ahead of potential losses. Pluralsight Inc., an educational-software company, restructured last year and lenders took the keys to the business. Some market participants have warned of increased stress, as interest-rate relief keeps being pushed back. Private lenders are often able to stay ahead of restructurings and defaults by quietly amending loans and finding other solutions. However, even those back-door strategies have been put to the test in recent months. BlackRock is working with Evercore Inc., while Centerview Partners and AlixPartners are advising Alacrity, Bloomberg previously reported. The unitranche direct lenders are being advised by Latham & Watkins and FTI Consulting Inc. (Updates starting in second paragraph with further financing details.)

Title: As Los Angeles Burns, Conspiracy Peddlers Lie About—and Celebrate—the Danger We’re Living Through
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/los-angeles-fires-conspiracies/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T20:39:10Z
Full Content:
Mother Jones illustration; Getty For the last two mornings, I’ve woken up from broken sleep in my house on Los Angeles’ east side in a blind panic, the smell of smoke permeating the air. The light slanting in is a horrible, eerie orange, illuminating the white kitchen cabinets like a nightmare projection screen. When I climb onto the roof, the air in every direction is full of dark, low, menacing clouds fed by smoke, blocking out the mountains and trees even just a few miles away. Every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire, but a planned attack to further sinister ends. Our car is packed. Our important documents are in a tote bag by the back door. Every ping from the Watch Duty app, which sends out real-time fire alerts, sends me scrambling for my phone. I’m anxiously scrutinizing the perimeter of the Eaton fire, which has destroyed the homes of friends and community landmarks I love, willing it not to jump the 134 highway, praying today will be the day that helitankers will be able to slow the spread. I watch helplessly as the other fires across town engulf homes, businesses, send pets and livestock fleeing alone, reduce lives and memories to ash. I pray the death toll doesn’t mount higher. I watch friends and acquaintances on Instagram reporting from where they’ve evacuated, haggard and blank-faced with shock in hotel rooms and packed cars. I don’t know what kind of city we’ll have waiting for us on the other side of this. Naturally, then, as a journalist who’s covered conspiracy theories and disinformation for many years, it’s been reassuring to learn that the disaster threatening my safety can be blamed on false flag attacks, Democrat plotting, the evils of diversity, and—say it with me—the Jews. A disaster is a ripe moment for conspiracy peddlers to ply their wares, and a historic series of fires threatening a major city—especially one filled with Democrats, non-white people and wealthy celebrities—has sent the machine into overdrive. The theories being spread about the Los Angeles fires, as Nitish Pahwa wrote yesterday, are a mix of climate change denialism and attempts to pin the disasters on their usual and preferred villains. Perhaps most disturbing of all, they also contain an ugly dose of celebration and schadenfreude. “The Hollywood Hills are on fire,” are burning, tweeted an account associated with the network of Stew Peters, a far-right and deeply antisemitic podcaster. “It’s almost poetic.” Some of the themes emerging are consistent: pretty much every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire at all, but a planned attack meant to further some sinister end. This serves two purposes: casting doubt on the established science of climate change, and finding a more politically useful target to pin a disaster on. Conspiracy peddlers blamed the devastating 2018 wildfires in Northern California on “directed energy weapons,” a tidy mix of climate change skepticism blended with endless paranoia about what the government is capable of perpetrating on its own citizens. Typically, proponents’ “evidence” for this will be claiming that the fire is displaying unusual or suspicious behavior, unlike a “normal” fire. Those ideas quickly surfaced this week: Stew Peters, for instance, claimed that in some firestruck areas “none of the bushes and trees were disturbed at all” and the “lawns are still green,” adding, “the government wants to kill you and then they want to steal your land.” (This is, needless to say, simple bullshit: landscaping, brush, hedges and lawns have all been very much “disturbed” in fire-damaged areas.) “[O]ur Government who is working hand in glove with the WEF and Blackrock, is PURPOSELY setting fires using Military grade DEWs in these areas to initiate a MASSIVE LAND GRAB,” read another post representative of the theory, made on X by someone calling himself The Patriot Voice. Their account is verified, meaning that the user pays for Twitter and thus has the visibility of their posts and replies boosted on the site. The post has so far been viewed 180,000 times. The other common target from far-right conspiracists has been “DEI initiatives,” as a way of pushing the idea that Los Angeles’ fire and emergency services are somehow too woke to effectively fight fires, with characters like Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok devoting endless tweets to the fact that the Los Angeles Fire Department chief Kristin M. Crowley is a lesbian. As with a lot of conspiracy theories, the particular line of attack has been repeated by other more mainstream sources, including the Daily Wire, ex-Fox host Megyn Kelly, and the Federalist, who proclaimed that the LAFD is “DEI-crazed” and thus “made the fires worse.” Blogger Beth Brelje objected to the fact that the LAFD’s strategic plan didn’t use the word “hydrant” but talked about diversity and sustainability. While the plan doesn’t use that particular word and does include such projects, it discusses a wide range of goals in the sprawling department, including wildfire fighting preparedness. Fire hydrants near the Pacific Palisades fire didn’t run dry because of diversity; they ran dry because of an enormous demand for water to fight fires. Infowars and a variety of other conspiracy sites also claimed that the LAFD was flat-footed because “most of their supplies were sent to Ukraine,” a claim repeated by Donald Trump Jr. In fact, the LAFD sent surplus equipment to Ukraine three years ago, part of a national effort by fire departments to send aid. The “hoses, nozzles, turnouts, helmets, body armor, and other associated personal protective equipment” scrounged up, per the release, was packed up into just five pallets of gear, per a news story at the time—an amount irrelevant to what’s been needed to battle the current, devastating blazes. Some longtime conspiracy peddlers opted to take a more blanket approach, throwing out a list of buzzwords rather than pin responsibility for the fires on any one source. “Communist China sabotage teams?,” tweeted far-right personality and Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich. “Druggies? Random criminals doing arson? In Soros County LA, you can never know who is lighting these fires.” Despite the ugliness that I see every time I look at my phone for too long, out in the real world, there have been moments of beauty and solidarity. I’m on a text chain with my closest neighbors, which has been full of advice, gentle check-ins, and moments of delirious celebration: when work crews got our power turned back on we joked about who’d be the first outside to meet them with a bottle of tequila. (They vanished before I could dig out the good stuff, sadly.) Astonishingly, we’ve gotten regular mail deliveries; our mask-wearing mail carrier cheerfully greeted me with some letters, and told me, “I’m just pretending like it’s snow,” gesturing at the ash falling on our heads. Friends and acquaintances and family and total strangers have checked in, some offering their addresses as places to go. My brother-in-law offered to get in the car and drive to me. In the midst of a disaster, there are always moments of genuine warmth and solidarity. But none of them come from the people who are in the business of peddling fear and panic.

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Title: Is PG&E Corporation (PCG) the Best Utility Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Utility Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against the other utility stocks. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is putting an unprecedented strain on the power grid. One of the primary concerns is the unpredictable nature of AI demand. Unlike traditional industries, AI companies are experiencing exponential growth, making it difficult for utilities to forecast and plan for energy demand. This uncertainty is further complicated as the regulatory framework governing utilities is also a significant obstacle to addressing the energy crisis. Utilities are required to petition regulators for approval to invest in new infrastructure, which can be a time-consuming and uncertain process. This has led to a situation where utilities are unable to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the growth of AI, exacerbating the energy crisis. Read Also: 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing and 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now. In an interview with CNBC on December 6, Nicholas Campanella, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Barclays, discussed the growing demand for power to support the increasing needs of data centers and the tech industry. Campanella forecasts that the US would face a shortage of resources to meet this demand, making nuclear power an attractive option. Campanella cited the fact that gas turbines are largely sold out between now and 2029, and limited ability to bring on new renewables between now and 2026-2027. Campanella emphasized that the growing demand for power from data centers and hyperscalers would drive up demand for nuclear energy. Given the recent surge in their price, Campanella highlighted that investors should still buy stocks in utility and independent power-producing companies involved in nuclear power, citing the growing mismatch between supply and demand for power in the late decade. According to Campanella, utility companies that have nuclear assets are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, particularly those with early site permits or Combined Operating Licenses. Campanella pointed out that the last nuclear renaissance had left several sites with existing permits, which could be leveraged to expedite the development of new nuclear facilities. He forecasts that additional large-scale and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) commitments will be made in 2025. The growing energy demands driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and data centers present opportunities for investors, particularly in utility companies. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest utility companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Brightly-lit nighttime view of an electricity power grid with distribution lines and transmission substations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), headquartered in San Francisco, is the parent company of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The company serves approximately 16 million customers in Northern and Central California. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) generates electricity through a mix of natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable resources. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is actively expanding its capital investment plan to meet the growing demand for energy infrastructure in California. The company recently added $1 billion to its five-year capital plan, bringing the total to $63 billion through 2028. This additional investment is a direct response to the increasing customer demand for electrification, from housing developments to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, data centers, and commercial projects. The capital is designed to enhance the reliability and resilience of the company’s infrastructure while ensuring that these investments are affordable for customers and accretive to the company's earnings. Additionally, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is exploring innovative solutions to leverage new load in ways that benefit the grid. One notable example is the partnership with the Open School District and Zoom to deploy the nation's largest bidirectional electric school bus fleet. This fleet is equipped with vehicle-to-grid technology, allowing the buses to return energy to the grid when not in use. Overall PCG ranks 5th on our list of the best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PCG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PCG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: CA Tax Loophole Benefits Oil and Gas Companies, Undermines Firefighting Revenue

California’s oil and gas companies avoided paying billions of dollars in taxes that could have been used to fight the inferno. Fossil fuel companies are profiting off an obscure state tax break depriving California of up to $146 million of annual tax revenue that could be used to combat climate change-fueled wildfires, according to a new report released amid an inferno tearing through Los Angeles. The tax break has persisted for decades in the Democrat-controlled state even as California has faced deficits and cuts to wildfire preparedness — including recent cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget. During the first night of the fires, firefighters struggled to obtain water from fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood that had been set ablaze in western Los Angeles. A city council member who represents the Palisades neighborhood blamed the lack of water on “chronic underinvestment.” Just sign up below for a free subscription to The Lever to get access to this story and much more.

Title: BlackRock quits climate group in Wall Street's latest environmental step-back

By Ross Kerber (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter reviewed by Reuters. Its departure, BlackRock said, "does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." The firm said its active portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." NZAMI members pledge to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, using influence such as how they vote their proxies at corporate meetings. The group currently counts more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion, according to its website. Major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in recent weeks ahead of the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and as his fellow Republicans take control of Congress. While the departures may not have a direct effect on lending or share purchases, the companies' participation was seen as a marker of investors' environmental priorities. In December the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee sought information from BlackRock and dozens of other asset managers involved with NZAMI. In November BlackRock and rivals were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed their activism cut coal production and boosted energy prices. BlackRock has denied wrongdoing and said the lawsuit "discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." BlackRock's exit so far has not prompted others to follow. Representatives for two of its rivals, the asset management arms of State Street (NYSE:STT) and JPMorgan, said on Thursday they remain NZAMI members. Another major passive fund manager, Vanguard, left the group in 2022. A NZAMI spokesperson via email called any investor withdrawal disappointing. "Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realise the benefits of the economic transition to net zero," the spokesperson said. Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds, oversaw her firm's departure from NZAMI in 2023 even though it avoids oil and coal stocks. On Thursday she called the departures by bigger firms "disheartening" since their memberships showed investors want lower-carbon portfolios. "This is short sighted given the stark realities of climate change and the need to push for environmentally responsible actions in corporate America," Samuelrich said. CLEANING THINGS UP Efforts such as NZAMI, which was created in 2020 and boosted by a 2021 United Nations climate conference, began without controversy as world leaders looked for ways to harness capital to transition the world to cleaner energy sources. But U.S. Republican officials, many from energy-producing states, have disparaged the efforts as "woke capital" claiming they violate antitrust laws. In a statement sent by a representative, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan called BlackRock's departure "a huge win for freedom and American prosperity. All U.S. financial institutions should follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies," using an acronym referring to investor consideration of environmental, social and governance factors. In its client letter, BlackRock said its sustainable-investment efforts are "driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets."

Title: Costco Sales Jump on a Shift in the Holiday Shopping Season
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/costco-sales-jump-on-a-shift-in-the-holiday-shopping-season-5789016
Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:37:55Z
Full Content:
Costco continued its winning streak in December thanks to a delayed holiday shopping season in 2024, with Cyber Monday falling in the last month of the year rather than in November. E-commerce led to comparable sales gains for the five weeks, up 34.4 percent, followed by a 9.3 percent gain in U.S. and 4.3 percent in Canadian sales. The company attributed the strong e-commerce sales in December to the positive impact of an estimated 15 percentage points due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday in 2024 occurring a week later than in 2023. However, the wholesale club has consistently reported solid online and in-store sales in recent months, meaning that the robust December numbers are part of an ongoing trend rather than an aberration. The sales results sent Costco’s shares nearly 2 percent higher in after-hours trading. The stock is up 41.37 percent over the past 12 months and 218.30 percent over five years, beating the S&P 500, up 25.99 percent and 82.82 percent over the corresponding periods. Costco is in the right place at the right time and has the right value proposition for its customers. The place is merging online and offline sales, where shoppers can order merchandise online and pick it up in local stores the same day. This strategy has helped traditional brick-and-mortar store chains such as Costco, Walmart, and Target fend off Amazon’s challenge, as the e-commerce giant doesn’t have an extensive brick-and-mortar presence. Then there’s Costco’s value proposition, the relentless pursuit for superior product quality and customer services provided by dedicated employees, which create an exceptional shopper experience worth a membership fee. “Costco’s strong December performance, with a 34.4 percent jump in e-commerce sales, reflects the strength of its business model and culture,” Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of economics and finance at Manhattan University, told The Epoch Times. “The company’s focus on delivering value, fair wages, and trust has built loyalty among employees and customers. Its ability to adapt to shifts, such as the later timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and quickly pass cost savings to shoppers underscores its resilience.” The company’s focus on superior product quality is also reflected in the pace at which it opens new stores. Unlike other traditional retailers, which open stores at a feverish pace, Costco opens stores slowly. It currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the UK, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, 7 in China, 5 in Spain, 2 in France, and 1 each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco also operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the UK, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. However, Koimisis sees a few challenges ahead for the wholesale club’s growth, such as tariffs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions that could create significant cost pressures, making it harder to sustain current pricing strategies. “Expanding the Kirkland Signature private-label brand could be a key strategy to address these challenges, offering affordable, high-quality alternatives to national brands while reducing reliance on external suppliers,” he said. “Simultaneously, diversifying supply chains and investing in technology to manage bottlenecks will be essential.”

Title: AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL) on Substack by Steve Wagner. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RCEL. AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL)'s share was trading at $8.94 as of Jan 8th. A doctor interacting with a patient, discussing the progress of their treatment. Avita Medical (NASDAQ:RCEL) has recently secured FDA approval for its new RECELL GO mini, a disposable cartridge designed specifically for treating smaller wounds up to 480 square centimeters. This innovative product fills a critical gap in the wound care market, particularly for high-volume, smaller wounds typically encountered in trauma and burn centers. Unlike the standard RECELL GO, which is capable of treating wounds up to 1,920 square centimeters, the mini version uses the same multi-use processing device but with an optimized cartridge for smaller skin samples. This adjustment leads to reduced resource consumption and waste, making the product more cost-effective, a key consideration for hospitals facing budget constraints. The RECELL GO mini approval is a strategic move for Avita, allowing the company to expand its reach into a segment of the market previously underserved by its standard offering. This smaller version targets trauma centers that previously could not justify the use of the standard RECELL GO due to the size of their patients' wounds. By providing a more versatile, smaller-scale solution, Avita aims to lower the barriers to adoption, encouraging trauma centers to integrate the RECELL GO platform into their treatments. This should drive increased product uptake, particularly in facilities that treat smaller wounds, which are common in trauma and burn cases. Avita plans to begin rolling out the RECELL GO mini in Q1 2025, aligning the product launch with hospital budgeting cycles. This timing could expedite adoption, as healthcare facilities often make purchasing decisions at the start of the fiscal year. With the U.S. burn care market alone valued at over $2 billion, Avita is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the market by offering a solution that covers a wider range of wound sizes. The mini cartridge’s efficiency, which reduces waste and optimizes resources, should help hospitals manage costs while improving patient care. For Avita Medical, the approval of RECELL GO mini is expected to drive significant revenue growth by attracting new customers and expanding sales within existing accounts. By offering a more practical, size-specific solution, the company stands to improve its margins through more efficient use of resources, while increasing adoption across trauma and burn centers. This strategic product expansion enhances Avita’s market positioning, and as the company continues to roll out the RECELL GO mini, it is likely to see positive financial results, making it an attractive investment opportunity. AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 3 hedge fund portfolios held RCEL at the end of the third quarter which was 5 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of RCEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Funding Rates Down: Is Bitcoin Heading For A $90K Correction?

Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:00:30Z

Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations have left investors in a state of uncertainty, as the cryptocurrency has seen a dramatic decline from its peak of nearly $107,000 to around $94,550. This volatility raises essential questions about the ability of Bitcoin to maintain its rally and whether it can regain its footing in the coming weeks. CryptoQuant analyst Shayan has had something important to say about current conditions in Bitcoins. According to him, the price is trying to stabilize right above the value of $92,000 level, which he further says is a key support. He notes that Bitcoin is stabilizing near the $92,000 mark, which he identifies as a crucial support zone. If Bitcoin breaks below this level, it could trigger a wave of long liquidations and push prices down toward the 100-day moving average of $81,000. Also, this line has been performing as a real dynamic support by attracting buying inflows and can also cushion prices during further descent. Shayan underlines the role of market sentiment and technical indicators. At present, Bitcoin is fluctuating at significant support levels which are created in the $90K level and Fibonacci retracement levels at $87K and $82K. If the above-mentioned levels do not hold, there could be further selling pressure with corrections. Amidst this uncertainty, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Rover has expressed a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. He recently compared today’s price action with historical patterns, suggesting that January could see positive trends for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here. pic.twitter.com/DCssLNMGh6 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 8, 2025 In a tweet, he stated, “Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here.” His analysis indicates that if Bitcoin can break through the critical resistance level of $100,000, it could potentially barrel past $107,000. Rover’s positivity is strengthened by the huge capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted more than $900 million of inflows from institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Increasing institutional interest also signals confidence in the long-term prospect of Bitcoin. However, he also cautions that failure to close above the $100,000 mark will lead to a pullback to $92,000 or even lower. The broader cryptocurrency market is feeling the strain too. This decline comes in tandem with Bitcoin’s failure to stay afloat, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have fallen by more than 7%. Even the traditional stocks of the crypto sector, such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase, have been down sharply. Funding rates falling within the derivatives market adds yet another layer of bearish sentiment around Bitcoin. According to Shayan, the decreasing funding rates had reflected dipping demand for derivatives, which also played a pivotal role in maintaining price trends.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

On Thursday, the Dutch government inked a hardware and technological expertise deal with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over a potential artificial intelligence (AI) facility. The Netherlands targets a facility for an AI ‘supercomputer’ that could potentially contribute to research and development. In 2024, the Dutch government earmarked 204.5 million euros ($210 million) for investments in AI.

Washington could impose three tiers of chip curbs, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) of the Netherlands emerged as a key AI beneficiary, backed by its lithography portfolio and scalable EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology, which helped contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) manufacture high-performance chips for Nvidia’s AI processors. The semiconductor equipment maker projected annual sales of $46.51 billion – $63.43 billion (44 billion euros – 60 billion euros) by 2030 and a gross margin target of 56%-60%. It expects global sales to surpass $1 trillion by 2030, backed by the integration of AI across industries. Price Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 0.02% at $140.11 Wednesday.

Sean Pyles: Well, here we are. It's a new year. Time to take stock of how things are going with our investments. Are you thinking maybe it's time to take a bit more risk or are you looking at your portfolio and wondering if it's time to pull back? We've got some ways for you to consider all the options for investing in your financial future. Sam Taube: I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sam Taube: And I'm Sam Taube. Sean Pyles: It's 2025. Do you know how your stocks are doing? Are you doing that classic new year exercise of checking the batteries in your fire detector and rebalancing your portfolio? Will you be investing some time in your investing strategy? It's a great time of year to do that, and Sam, today we've got a whole slew of tips for getting started. Sam Taube: Yes, we do, and let's say upfront what we always say at the end of the show, which is that we are not investment advisors, and this nerdy investment info is for general educational purposes only. It may not apply to your specific circumstances. That said, a lot of us touch the investing world in some way, whether it's through retirement accounts, college savings plans, or maybe a health savings account. Sean Pyles: The latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances showed that some 58% of US households had some sort of stock ownership as part of their finances. That was the highest number on record. The survey measured the year 2019 to 2022, so it included the COVID era and the meme stock era, for whatever that's worth. Sam Taube: For some people, that era was worth a lot. For others, not so much. That Fed survey is also borne out by another survey, this time the Economy and Personal Finance survey from Gallup. That one found that around 62% of American adults invest in stocks. That's everything from what we already mentioned—savings for retirement or college—to people holding individual stock portfolios. If you're interested in investing, well, you have a lot of company. Sean Pyles: Sam, how about you tell us exactly what's going to happen in the stock market this year so we can all make a lot of money? Sam Taube: I would be a very rich man if I could do that, but unfortunately, I can't. Sean Pyles: Bummer. Sam Taube: What we can do here is prepare for both the best and the worst, and make it so that the daily stock market gyrations don't factor that much into our overall well-being. Our goal today is to make that possible for you. Sean Pyles: Fair enough. We want to hear what you think too, listeners. What are you working on in your financial life as we start the new year? Leave us a voicemail or text the Nerd hotline at (901) 720-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D, or email a voice memo to [email protected]. Sam, last week we talked with fellow Nerd and chief economist, Elizabeth Renter, about financial regrets. Let me ask you to gaze back on last year and talk about what the investing year was like, and maybe some regrets or at least lessons we might be able to take away from it. Sam Taube: It was a rip-roaring year for a lot of different kinds of investments. The S&P 500 was up over 25% year-to-date by early December, which is when we're recording this. That's an exceptionally good return compared to the long-term average of 10% per year. It was also a really big year for crypto. Bitcoin more than doubled in price last year, and certain tech stocks did even better than that. Nvidia shareholders, for example, almost tripled their money last year. If you spend enough time on social media, you find stories of people who have gotten very rich very quickly from big bets on these things over the last year. If you weren't one of those people, it's easy to get retroactive FOMO about it. Sean Pyles: Yeah, I feel that. Sam Taube: In truth, if you diversify your investments enough, you're not really missing out. As a personal example, I did not own individual shares of Nvidia at any point last year, but I did indirectly profit from Nvidia's gains because I own S&P 500 index funds, which contain Nvidia. My returns for the year were probably lower than someone who went all in on that single stock. On the other hand, that person was probably a lot more stressed about their investment than I was. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about some of the standout sectors that did especially well or especially poorly. I know you were all over the Nvidia story and came on the show a couple of times to talk about it. What were some other winners? Sam Taube: Tech in general had a pretty good year. The NASDAQ composite is actually doing even better than the S&P 500 at the time of recording in late 2024. There's still a lot of hype for certain kinds of AI and semiconductor-related companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, and as we previously mentioned, Nvidia. They've kind of carried the tech sector this year. Another sector that outperformed the market in 2024 was communications. There's a blurred line between communications and tech. For example, Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook, had a really great year, as have certain kinds of big media conglomerates like Disney and Netflix. Another big outperformer last year was the financial services sector. A lot of the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also outperformed the market by quite a bit, and then, as we mentioned, crypto had a really great year. Sean Pyles: That's right. My Dogecoin shot up quite a bit after the election. As of this recording, it's at a whopping 38 cents, and it was often much, much lower, maybe closer to 1 cent at different points in the year. I'm really proud of the performance of my joke cryptocurrency. Sam Taube: Congrats. Sean Pyles: So, Sam, how about some loser industries in 2024? Sam Taube: The energy sector was kind of a laggard last year. It had a positive return, but less than the S&P 500. The performance of oil and gas stocks, generally speaking, is very dependent on the market price of oil, and that has actually decreased slightly over the course of 2024. You might think that poor performance in the fossil fuel industry would mean that clean energy has done well, but that has not been the case. Clean energy, particularly solar, has actually had a really rough year. The Invesco Solar ETF, which is sometimes used as a benchmark for the solar industry, was down almost 30% last year, despite the strong performance of so many other stocks. Sean Pyles: What, if anything, do these poor performers tell us about what might be coming for the markets in 2025? Sam Taube: A lot of these trends, both the winners and some of the losers, are likely related to the election. There's a theory that the stock market was anticipating that President-elect Donald Trump would win. Many of these trends may reflect expected changes in government policy or regulations that have been priced into the market over the last year. For example, the Biden administration has made some moves toward trying to break up some of the big monopolistic tech companies. Shareholders in that industry may be betting that those antitrust actions are just going to go away under Trump. Another thing that's really important for the tech industry is there's a perception that we may be getting a looser regulatory approach to AI under Trump than we might've gotten under Vice President Kamala Harris. Bank shareholders may also be anticipating looser regulations. In his first term, Trump loosened some of the banking regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and there's a chance he may do more of that in his second term. It's a similar deal with crypto. Markets may be just betting on less regulation in that space. Sean Pyles: Going back to the clean energy industry, do you think the dip there is also election-related? Sam Taube: There is a good case for it. The solar industry, in particular, has really benefited from tax credits under Biden, and shareholders may be predicting that those tax credits won't last. But there's an important caveat here, which is that there are a lot of assumptions in this thinking. We don't necessarily know what's going to come out of this new administration, and if these policy changes I've talked about don't happen — say the new government doesn't loosen banking regulations or it keeps the solar tax credit going — then these trends that we've been talking about might reverse somewhat. Sean Pyles: The main stock indices — S&P 500, Dow — hit new records last year over and over again. What does that mean historically? The saying is that what goes up must come down, but what do we know about how markets and investors behave in an environment of rising stock prices? Sam Taube: "What goes up must come down" is very true in physics, but in some ways, the inverse is true when we're talking about the stock market. When it comes to stock indexes like the S&P 500, it's kind of "what goes down must come up." Bear markets do happen, and they can feel really gnarly while they're happening, but they're generally followed by much longer bull markets that tend to surpass previous highs by quite a bit. Since 1932, the average S&P 500 bear market has lasted less than two years. The average bull market, on the other hand, has lasted more than four years, and we just had a bear market in 2022. History suggests that we've got a lot more upside ahead, even after a very strong 2024. Sean Pyles: At a high level, Sam, should we even pay attention when we hear news items about stocks hitting records? Sam Taube: For long-term investors, I can't really think of an immediate action anyone needs to take when we hit a new high, but it's something to keep in mind. A lot of people set up their portfolio to contain a particular mix of stocks and bonds, say 80% stocks, 20% bonds, and when we have a really strong year in the stock market, it can sometimes mess up those proportions. If stocks go up more than bonds, you might log into your retirement account or whatever after a while away and find that you now have a 90:10 stock and bond portfolio. This is why financial advisors recommend rebalancing your portfolio once or twice a year, which you mentioned at the beginning of this episode. That means selling off some of the investments that have done really well and then using the proceeds to purchase some more of the investments that have lagged so that you maintain your target mix over time. Sean Pyles: Okay. We're going to take a short break. We are back in a moment with more investing information for 2025. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: Sam, it's time to get personal. How are you approaching investing in 2025? Doing anything different, new, exciting, boring? What are you keeping your eye on? Sam Taube: I'm mostly very boring. Almost all my investments are in index funds, and I'm planning to hold them for years. For the most part, I'm just going to keep holding and adding money to them in 2025. I do also have a tiny amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's spare money, and I don't have a particularly strong investment thesis for it, but one Bitcoin was worth a few hundred dollars in the early 2010s, and recently, it passed a hundred thousand dollars. I want to see what it does in the years ahead. In our line of work, people can sometimes sound a little bit scoldy when we talk about high-risk speculative investments like crypto. I don't know if it's realistic to tell people that they should never, ever touch stuff like that. I know how risky crypto is, but I'm a human being, and I'm curious about it. But I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first, and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: I think that's good advice. You cover your fundamentals first, make sure that you are saving and investing for retirement, and then if you have some leftover cash, maybe dabble a bit in other areas. But I think if people are putting all of their money into crypto for retirement, that's a very risky, potentially dangerous idea. Sam Taube: Exactly. Very well said. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about how to get into investing if it's something that you're not already immersed in but maybe want to experiment with, especially outside of retirement and other savings funds. With the caveat once again that we are not investment advisors, what's a good way to dip a toe into the stock market waters—or maybe the bond waters if that's your thing? Sam Taube: The first step is going to be to open an investment account if you don't have one. NerdWallet has some really helpful roundups of the best brokerage accounts if you don't know where to look. Once you have an account, you need to put some money in, and then you also need to invest that money. I've mentioned index funds a couple of times already. For listeners who don't know, these are baskets of stocks that mirror the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. They're really good for beginners. The nice thing about S&P 500 index funds and most other index funds is that they give you exposure to dozens or hundreds of stocks in a single purchase. They're pretty low maintenance. You don't really have to research the individual stocks or worry about whether or not they're doing better or worse than the overall market because index funds just give you the overall market's return. Sean Pyles: And what are some red flags to keep an eye out for if you are new to the investing world? Sam Taube: There's a lot of bad faith and scammy information out there, and I think a big red flag is any kind of promised return. If you come across some crypto product or investment guru or something who promises that they can double your money in a year, that's probably a scam. A milder red flag is if someone or something is bragging about its past returns. If you go on TikTok, you can find these stock-picking gurus who advertise themselves by bragging about the big 500% score they made on Nvidia options last year or whatever the case may be. The thing is, even if that claim is legitimate, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. It's still good to be skeptical of any kind of influencer or financial product that advertises itself that way. There's a common thread here, which is to be aware of things that sound like get-rich-quick schemes. If it seems too good to be true, there's a good chance that it is. Sean Pyles: Sam, what are some ways to figure out which investing platform is best for you? There are so many apps and websites out there. What advice do you have for picking one over another? What factors should people be considering? Sam Taube: The best investing platform for a particular person is going to depend on their goals and also on their skill level. Again, I'm going to plug NerdWallet's roundups here because we have a whole bunch of them that cater to different kinds of needs. If you're looking for a retirement account, we have a roundup of the best IRAs. If you're really new to investing, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for beginners. If you're more experienced and you're looking to trade options, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for options, too. On each of these roundups, we have a really easy-to-read table that lists each broker's fees, account minimums, active promotions, and our NerdWallet rating, and also detailed pros and cons lists for each one. We want to make it easy for you to do all your comparison shopping in one place. Of course, we'll include a link to those in today's show notes. Sean Pyles: Sam, I wonder if you could talk a bit about the relative importance of stock markets in our financial lives. There's a common saying that the stock market is not the economy, right? Yes, it's a large part of the financial world, but would you agree that it's not the end-all, be-all? When we hear news headlines about the stock market, we need to understand that there are other aspects of the economy that are just as important. Sam Taube: Absolutely. For that matter, if you're really just starting out from square one financially, investing probably isn't even going to be your top priority, and ditto if you're trying to recover from some kind of setback or get out of debt. Many advisors would say that building up an emergency fund and paying down high-interest debts like credit card debt are good things to tackle before you even start thinking about long-term savings and investments. Sean Pyles: Very sound advice. Sam Taube, thank you so much for helping us out today. Sam Taube: Always great to be here. Sean Pyles: And be sure to join us next week as we continue to look at your money in 2025. We're going to hear all about budgeting and how to manage your credit life. Kim Palmer: The main caution to watch out for with credit cards is overspending. Credit cards can just be really tricky because it doesn't necessarily feel like real money, and other than the credit limit on the card, there's really nothing stopping us to keep swiping away to buy what we want.

Title: Trump’s play for Greenland could make Ozempic more expensive

Denmark is the latest in a series of countries that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened with tariffs — joining a list that includes the 26 other nations of the European Union, as well as Canada and Mexico. However, if he follows through with imposing tariffs on imports coming from Denmark, it could drive up the already expensive cost of one of America’s fastest-growing obsessions: weight-loss drugs. Earlier this week, during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump said he would impose “very high” tariffs on Denmark if it refused to let Greenland become part of the United States. Greenland, a North American island with a population of nearly 60,000, is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Although Denmark ranks just 41st on the list of top U.S. trading partners, the two countries exchanged over $16 billion worth of goods in 2023. Denmark’s top export into the U.S. is packaged medicine, which makes sense considering it is home to pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.47%). The company is the maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH in 2023. The Danish pharma giant even helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to have done so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, projects that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, driven primarily by Novo Nordisk. The popular drugs work by mimicking gut hormones that help regulate blood sugar and curb appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss benefits. According to Morgan Stanley (MS-3.14%) analysts, the global market for this class of medications could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, the bank projects that around 31.5 million people — or nearly 10% of the population — will be using these type of drugs by 2035. It’s unclear how tariffs on Denmark might affect the price of these medications, which can cost more than $1,000 without insurance, as Novo Nordisk manufactures them at facilities around the world. In June, the company announced it was investing over $4 billion to boost its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: This 14.3% Dividend Could Double In Trump 2.0

PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DECEMBER 22: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump smiles during Turning Point USA's ... [+] AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center on December 22, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. The annual four day conference geared toward energizing and connecting conservative youth hosts some of the country's leading conservative politicians and activists. (Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is an intriguing everything-proof stock for Trump 2.0. The company specializes in cutting-edge surgical devices and regardless of what the Fed or President-Elect Trump does in 2025, we know that Americans will continue to have surgeries. Human surgeons are expensive and prone to mistakes, so the big trend in the surgery room is towards robotics. Intuitive created the da Vinci system, the most widely used surgical robot in the world. Business is booming. The company anticipates 12% to 16% year-over-year demand growth for da Vinci. Its technology is less invasive and more precise than humans, which leads to faster recovery times for patients. The company just launched da Vinci 5, which has already been used in over 12,000 procedures. ISRG shareholders had a field day during Trump 1.0. The stock returned 179%. Why wouldn’t history repeat, or at least rhyme, and reward investors with another double or better? The bummer for us dividend investors is that Intuitive doesn’t pay one. Now, we could manufacture a payout by buying the stock and selling covered calls. But that is a pain. Today, call options with strike prices just above ISRG’s current price fetch a $10+/share premium. They expire later this month. So we could buy the stock, sell (“write”) those covered calls, and pocket the 2% premium. Then, we rinse and repeat in February. And March. And so on. We know this strategy. But it is a grind. Why not outsource it to, say, a fund manager? Rather than spending the rest of our lives writing covered calls, we are going to explore a “backdoor” payout play on ISRG. It nets us a 14.3% yearly dividend, paid monthly. Better yet, there are no monthly check-ins from our side. We buy the fund once and manager Dr. Erin Xie and her team do the rest of the work. All we do is buy the closed-end fund (CEF) BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BMEZ). ISRG is Dr. Xie’s top holding at 4.6% of the portfolio. What a pick! The doctor’s fund BMEZ must be rallying in anticipation of Trump 2.0, right? Wrong! On the contrary, the fund sits in the bargain bin, believe it or not. BMEZ trades at a 9% discount to the value of its assets. In other words, we are able to snag this high-yield bounty for just 91 cents on the dollar. We’re “up” 9% without breaking a sweat. Why the sweet dividend deal? On the campaign trail, Trump said he was going to let former candidate turned supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild on health.” A big “uh oh” for healthcare stocks? The Wall Street suits didn’t wait around to find out. They have dumped anything and everything healthcare since the election and especially since RFK was nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Big pharma has especially been a hot potato because Trump also said of RFK at a rally: “I’m going to let him go wild on medicines.” But Intuitive is not a medicine peddler. It is a surgical robotics innovator. Emotional investors will throw out an entire sector willy-nilly. So, the BMEZ selloff makes exactly zero sense. The same logic extends to BMEZ’s top five holdings. Check out how they performed as a group during Trump 1.0! BMEZ Top Holdings These are all companies that benefit from less regulation.

Title: What’s Happening With eBay Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/09/whats-happening-with-ebay-stock/

POLAND - 2024/12/17: In this photo illustration, the eBay company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The stock price of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw a 10% jump on Wednesday, January 8, after Meta announced that it would allow certain eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace. A collaboration with Meta might strengthen eBay’s competitive standing in the e-commerce landscape. eBay has been struggling with falling gross merchandise volume, which fell from$87.4 billion in 2021 to $73.2 billion in 2023, due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Higher inflation and weak consumer sentiment have weighed on the company’s top-line growth. However, the company has seen a slight recovery in 2024. The recent move from Meta will help eBay improve its GMV, given the solid traffic Facebook sees. For Meta, this move comes after the European Commission imposed a penalty over alleged anticompetitive practices in its online classifieds business. eBay stock has had a good past year – thanks to the recovery in GMV. It was up 45% in 2024, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, up 23%. Looking at a slightly longer period, eBay has seen its stock rise 75% from levels of $40 in early 2023 to $63 now. This can be attributed to: eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher GMV and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Separately, look at What’s Happening With RGTI Stock? Looking at the company’s profitability, its operating margin declined from 24% in 2022 to 21.3% now. Given the fall in revenue and operating margin, eBay’s adjusted net income declined from $2.7 billion in 2022 to $2.4 billion now. However, its share repurchases helped the bottom line expand from $4.02 to $4.69 over this period. Although EBAY has outperformed the broader markets lately, the increase in EBAY stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 45% in 2024. While EBAY stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and weak consumer sentiment, could EBAY face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think it’s fully valued. We estimate eBay valuation to be $60 per share, 13% below the current market price of $69. At its current levels, EBAY stock is already trading at over 13x its forward expected earnings of $5.21 per share in 2025. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 11x over the last five years. While EBAY stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how eBay’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Microsoft cuts more jobs, this time apparently based on performance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The technology industry is still grappling with ongoing financial challenges leading to widespread job losses, with Microsoft the latest to be affected. Having already got rid of 10,000 workers (or around 5% of its headcount) at the height of the layoffs in January 2023, Microsoft went on to lay off at least another 2,500 of its employees in June 2024. Now, just a week into 2025, the company has confirmed further reductions, affecting less than 1% of its workforce, which stood at 228,000 employees six months ago. “At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent… We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action,” the company confirmed in an email to CNBC, indicating the redundancies could be part of a regular restructuring effort rather than a reaction to financial performance. However, despite posting a revenue increase of 12% in its most recent quarter, around one percentage point ahead of key hyperscaler rivals Amazon and Google, Microsoft share prices didn’t quite please investors. Over the past 12 months, Microsoft shares have risen 12.98%, compared with 37.06% for Google and a staggering 46.75% for Amazon. Share prices don’t paint a full picture of the company’s performance though – it has the largest market cap of the three hyperscalers by far, at $3.156 trillion, compared with $2.382 for Google and $2.335 for Amazon.

Title: Refining fine-mapping: Effect sizes and regional heritability
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480
Time Published: 2025-01-09T14:00:00Z

Recent statistical approaches have shown that the set of all available genetic variants explains considerably more phenotypic variance of complex traits and diseases than the individual variants that are robustly associated with these phenotypes. However, rapidly increasing sample sizes constantly improve detection and prioritization of individual variants driving the associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. Therefore, it is useful to routinely estimate how much phenotypic variance the detected variants explain for each region by taking into account the correlation structure of variants and the uncertainty in their causal status. Here we extend the FINEMAP software to estimate the effect sizes and regional heritability under the probabilistic model that assumes a handful of causal variants per region. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) data to simulate genomic regions, we demonstrate that FINEMAP provides higher precision and enables more detailed decomposition of regional heritability into individual variants than the variance component model implemented in BOLT or the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS, particularly when there are only a few causal variants in the fine-mapped region. Using data from 2,940 plasma proteins from the UKB study, we observed that on average FINEMAP identified 2.5 causal variants at an association signal and captured 36% more regional heritability than the variant with the lowest P-value. We estimate that in genomic regions with notable contribution to the total heritability, FINEMAP captures on average 13% and 40% more heritability than BOLT and HESS respectively. Our analysis shows how FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where inference of a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture is possible. Advancements in statistical methodologies to analyze Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed that numerous genetic variants across the whole genome significantly contribute to the phenotypic variation in quantitative traits and disease risk. As sample sizes in GWAS grow, there is a continuous improvement in identifying and prioritizing individual variants that drive associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. To better understand both the individual and joint contribution of these variants to phenotypic variation, we extend the FINEMAP software to simultaneously estimate effect sizes of individual variants and heritability of genomic regions. Using simulations, we study how regional heritability estimates of FINEMAP and existing heritability approaches relate to each other and when a fine-mapping model is able to accurately narrow down the regional heritability into contributions from individual variants. In the analysis of plasma biomarkers, we demonstrate that FINEMAP offers more precise regional heritability estimates than existing heritability approaches in genomic regions that contribute notably to the total heritability. These new features in FINEMAP enable routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, and inform us about the genetic architecture of each genomic region.

Over the last decade, GWAS have accumulated a massive catalog of robust statistical associations between numerous genomic regions and complex traits or diseases [1]. Typically, genetic variants highlighted by GWAS explain only a small fraction of total phenotypic variation (the missing heritability problem [2]) and are clustered into clumps of even hundreds of highly correlated variants giving rise to the fine-mapping problem [3]. The missing heritability problem has spurred highly successful methodological research in variance components models to evaluate the heritability contribution from the whole genome, not just from the statistically significantly associated variants [4–6]. Software packages implementing variance component models include EMMAX [7], GCTA [8], GEMMA [9], MMM [10] and BOLT [5]. Common to these implementations is the requirement of individual-level genotype-phenotype data and the assumption that the phenotype has a polygenic architecture under which all variants are causal with tiny effects. Heritability estimation using a polygenic model has also been carried out with LD Score regression [6] and a polygenic score method AVENGEME [11] from GWAS summary statistics without access to the original genotype-phenotype data. Together these methods have considerably narrowed the gap between estimated SNP heritability and heritability estimates from twin studies for many phenotypes and, importantly, shed light on the genetic architecture and enrichment of functional genetic variation in complex traits and diseases [12–13]. With increasing statistical power of GWAS comes a possibility to narrow the heritability down into specific regions of the genome. Heritability estimation in genomic regions from GWAS summary statistics was introduced in the software package HESS [14] under the assumption of arbitrary genetic architecture and a fixed-effect model for causal effect sizes. HESS estimates heritability through a regularized quadratic form built on marginal effect size estimates of all variants and their pairwise correlations to account for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between them. HESS was shown to be more accurate than LD Score regression in regional heritability estimation on simulated data when both methods were run with pairwise correlations either from the original genotype data or a reference panel. Although polygenic and fixed-effect models have been very useful approaches for the estimation of genome-wide or regional heritability, the model assumptions of polygenicity or arbitrary genetic architecture likely leave room for improvement in accuracy if regional heritability can be attributed to only a few causal variants. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to pinpoint the individual variants contributing to heritability and obtain accurate effect size estimates for them. Because existing heritability estimation methods do not provide such information, we turn to the fine-mapping framework instead. The decisive solution to the fine-mapping problem is often hindered by the lack of information due to small effect sizes, high LD between variants and imperfect genotype information. Therefore, many recent fine-mapping methods [15–19] implement principled probabilistic quantification of causal variants that can then be used for downstream analyses. As GWAS sample sizes are soon counted in millions providing unprecedented accuracy for statistical fine-mapping, it would be useful to routinely evaluate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by the fine-mapped variants. In particular, we may expect that fine-mapping captures a large part of the regional heritability in 1) molecular endophenotypes with moderate to large effect sizes at causal variants, and 2) in large-scale biobank projects and ongoing GWAS meta-analyses with adequate statistical power to detect most individual causal variants even with smaller effect sizes. On the other hand, fine-mapping is likely not informative in regions with only tiny effect sizes or in GWAS with very small sample sizes. In cases where the fine-mapping seems to explain the total regional heritability, we have a much more informative picture of the regional architecture than is given by the existing heritability estimation methods that do not identify individual causal variants. Therefore, we have extended the FINEMAP software [18] to provide estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability. Our previously published FINEMAP algorithm (version 1.1) [18] worked only with small causal effect sizes and did not provide estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. Here we introduce FINEMAP version 1.4 that estimates causal effects of arbitrary magnitude and estimates regional heritability by accounting for the uncertainty of the causal configuration and the LD-adjusted joint effect sizes of causal variants. We compare regional heritability estimation using FINEMAP with both the variance component model implemented in BOLT and the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS. Ideally, with such comparisons, we can evaluate how much of the total regional heritability we capture with fine-mapped variants. Previously, Gusev et al. [20] have studied how the variance explained by the variant with the lowest P-value of a GWAS region compares to the results of a variance component model applied to the same region. They reported that on average the variance component model explained 1.29 times more heritability over nine diseases. We use plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins from the UKB, with a broad spectrum of genome-wide heritability levels. As an example where both FINEMAP and BOLT give a similar estimate of about 41% regional heritability, we study in detail the association between the PON1 gene and Paraoxonase 1 levels. To interpret the results from our protein data analysis more generally, we also perform a simulation study to evaluate FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. As our ultimate goal is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants, it is useful to know how the heritability estimates of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where such decomposition is indeed possible. More generally, an ability to do routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, including a fine-mapping model, further informs us about the genetic architecture of each region. We start with a motivating example of a region with a large contribution to the total heritability. Next, we study by simulation how a fine-mapping method FINEMAP, a variance component model BOLT and a fixed-effect heritability estimation model HESS perform more generally. Finally, we apply the methods to estimate the regional heritability of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTLs). Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein encoded by the PON1 gene on chromosome 7. Serum levels of PON1 have been reported to be reversely associated with systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk [21]. The strongest genetic associations with the serum level of PON1 were indeed located near the PON1 gene, which agrees with an earlier GWAS [21]. We applied FINEMAP on a 5.9Mb genomic region around the PON1 gene with 1,095 variants. FINEMAP estimated that with over 95% probability 16 variants are needed to explain the association signal and the fine-mapped variants together explain a heritability of h2 = 0.42 (CI0.95: 0.40–0.43) which is considerably more than the lead variant rs854560 alone (h2 = 0.21, CI0.95: 0.20–0.22). The top configuration from FINEMAP included 16 variants which were compared to the top 16 variants identified by the stepwise conditioning (S1 Table). The log-likelihood difference was 48.2 in favor of the configuration identified by FINEMAP demonstrating the efficiency of the search algorithm of FINEMAP compared to the stepwise conditional analysis. BOLT estimated regional h2 = 0.41 (CI0.95: 0.39–0.44) which was similar to the estimate from FINEMAP but with a wider confidence interval. HESS with the default regularization gave an unexpectedly small value h2 = 0.33 (CI0.95: 0.32–0.34), that was larger than the marginal heritability contribution of the lead variant alone but clearly smaller than FINEMAP and BOLT. HESS without regularization of the LD matrix yielded a value h2 = 0.53 (CI0.95: 0.52–0.54) that was much larger than the values from FINEMAP and BOLT. As a conclusion, the PON1 cis-pQTL is an example of a large effect region where FINEMAP provides fine-mapping that is statistically preferred over both the stepwise conditioning and single-variant analysis, and produces heritability estimates that are more detailed and more precise than the results from BOLT or HESS. However, paraoxonase 1 levels are an extreme case with a very large regional heritability contribution from the cis-pQTL and low polygenicity for the levels of PON1 outside of the PON1 locus (BOLT h2 = 0.06, CI0.95: 0.02–0.10). Therefore, we next performed simulation studies to assess more generally the performance of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. Using datasets on 100 GWAS regions, we evaluated heritability estimation implemented in FINEMAP, HESS and BOLT in simulations with three randomly chosen causal variants. This setting of a very sparse genetic architecture is particularly suitable for FINEMAP and we are interested in how BOLT and HESS perform relative to FINEMAP in order to later interpret results from our protein data analysis. The FINEMAP results verified our implementation as the estimates were nearly unbiased and the precision increased with the sample size (Fig 1 and S2A Table). When the sample size was small or the heritability was low, FINEMAP tended to underestimate the heritability but this effect disappeared with increasing sample size. This phenomenon shows how our prior distributions favor sparse models and smaller effect sizes in cases where the information in the data is weak, but how the effect of the priors diminishes with more informative data. However, when the heritability is tiny and the data are uninformative (n = 5,000, h2 = 0.025%), FINEMAP can also overestimate the heritability (Fig 1A and S2A Table). BOLT was downwardly biased for the larger heritabilities but upwardly biased for the smaller heritabilities (Fig 1 and S2A Table). The downward bias for the large heritabilities may result from a clear violation of the polygenic model whereas the upward bias for the small heritabilities may exist because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence can overestimate heritability values close to zero. Root mean square error (RMSE) of BOLT improved with increasing sample size except for a heritability value of 5%. Compared to FINEMAP, BOLT had larger RMSE (S2B Table). This suggests that the polygenic assumption of BOLT leads to less accurate estimates compared to FINEMAP in cases where heritability can be attributed to a few causal variants. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included three causal variants with joint effect sizes chosen so that the three variants together account for the regional heritability in proportions of 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4%. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability.

For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480.g001 HESS with regularization indicated a systematic downward bias without improvement at larger sample sizes (Fig 1 and S2A Table). This may indicate that the regularization method applied by HESS can cause considerable underestimation of heritability in regions with only a few causal variants. We observed that HESS without regularization was upwardly biased across the sample sizes. The RMSE values from HESS were always larger than those from FINEMAP and, in most cases, also larger than those from BOLT (S2B Table). To assess the calibration of uncertainty estimates of h2, we study the coverage of 95% credible and confidence intervals defined as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability (S2B Table). For FINEMAP, the coverage was always at least 86% while for some of the 95% intervals of BOLT the coverage dropped below 10%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. S2B Table also shows the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method. If the estimated standard error or posterior standard deviation was frequentistically well calibrated, we would expect this ratio to be close to one. We see that for FINEMAP and HESS without regularization, in most scenarios, the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.2 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. For BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio is systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. S1A Fig shows a comparison of marginal posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF across datasets with three causal variants. The strategies for handling large effect regions yield similar PIPs for both methods, but we note that CAVIARBF does not produce estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. S1B Fig shows a comparison of PIPs from FINEMAP using different strategies to model large effect regions. FINEMAP v1.4 performs well in all settings whereas we observe many false positives when large effects are not appropriately accounted for in the previously published FINEMAP v1.1. This is because when we incorrectly assume that all effects are small, the only way to explain large regional heritability is by stipulating that also many non-causal variants contribute to the heritability. We also evaluated FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS in simulations with fifty randomly chosen causal variants using the 100 GWAS regions. This setting is less suitable for FINEMAP than the previous setting with three causal variants because individual causal variants now explain much less heritability. However, as large biobank data can provide adequate statistical power to detect many individual causal variants even with small effect sizes, these results are useful when we interpret the results from our protein data analysis. FINEMAP was downwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% (Fig 2A–2C) for all sample sizes except for the smallest sample size n = 5,000 when h2 was 0.025% (Fig 2A). For larger h2 of 5% and 50%, FINEMAP underestimated the heritability when n = 5,000 but this effect diminished with increasing sample size. These results show how the fine-mapping priors, that favor sparse causal models, tend to underestimate the heritability when the heritability is scattered across numerous tiny effects but this underestimation decreases when both the effect sizes and the sample sizes increase. BOLT was weakly upwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% except when h2 was 0.15% and n = 300,000 (Fig 2A–2C). For larger heritabilities, BOLT provided downwardly biased heritability estimates (Fig 2D–2F). Heritability estimates from HESS in simulations with fifty causal variants were similar to results in simulations with three causal variants (S2A, S2B, S3A and S3B Tables). Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four regional heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included 50 causal variants with equal effect size. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation.

The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480.g002 For FINEMAP, the coverage (S3B Table) was below 30% for all sample sizes and heritabilities except for the smallest h2 of 0.025% when n = 5,000 and n = 50,000 as well as for h2 of 0.15% and n = 5,000 when coverage was above 84%. The coverage of BOLT was always above 72%, except at h2 of 0.025% when n = 5,000 and at h2 of 50% when n = 300,000 the coverage dropped below 60%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. For FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method was systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. For HESS without regularization the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.0 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. We observed that as heritability and sample size increase, the expected number of causal variants estimated by FINEMAP becomes a reliable statistic to inform us about whether the genetic architecture in the region is sparse or polygenic. In S2 Fig we see that this statistic makes a clear distinction between the sparse and polygenic architectures starting from the setting when h2 = 0.15% and n = 300,000. GWAS of 2,490 unique proteins identified 14,189 genome-wide significant pQTL regions. Using BOLT, we estimated an average polygenic component of heritability from outside the pQTL regions of 0.11 per protein ranging from 0.00 (Transgelin-3, UniProt: Q9UI15) to 0.37 (Cystatin-M, UniProt: Q15828), whereas in 23% of the proteins causal variants in pQTLs estimated by FINEMAP explained more protein level variation than the polygenic component (Fig 3) and on average 36% more regional heritability than the lead variant alone (Fig 4A). FINEMAP analyses further showed that the posterior expected number of causal variants is 2.5 on average, ranging from 1 (Uromodulin, UniProt: P07911) to 30 (Amnionless, UniProt: Q9BXJ7), and that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of causal variants is 0.24 on average, ranging from 0.02 (ADAMTS-like protein 4, UniProt: Q6UY14) to 0.47 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5, UniProt: P06731). The region-specific results are given in S4 Table. Each circle represents the point estimate of heritability (h2) for the pQTL component (sum of variance explained across all pQTLs) vs. the polygenic component (genome-wide heritability excluding regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb).

When FINEMAP estimated regional heritability above h2 = 0.01 (2,302 / 14,189 regions), we observed 6.28 (CI0.95: 1.24–18.70) causal variants on average and the heritability estimates from FINEMAP were on average 13% larger than BOLT and 40% larger than HESS with default regularization (Fig 4B and 4C). This suggests that the regional genetic architecture of these pQTLs is not highly polygenic. For the regions where FINEMAP estimated a heritability level below 0.0l, the estimates from FINEMAP were on average 14% lower than BOLT and HESS with default regularization (Fig 5B and 5C). Compared to FINEMAP, the heritability estimates from HESS without regularization (Figs 4D and 5D) were 57% larger on average.

When the heritability captured by FINEMAP was more than h2 = 0.01, BOLT and HESS with default regularization provided respectively 83% and 20% wider 95% confidence intervals on average compared to FINEMAP. HESS without regularization provided 95% confidence intervals that were 162% wider on average compared to 95% credible intervals from FINEMAP. Large biobanks with hundreds of thousands of samples are boosting our ability to fine-map genomic regions, that is, to probabilistically quantify which of the many correlated genetic variants have a putative causal effect on complex traits and diseases. As the power to identify causal variants and the precision of their effect size estimates increases, it is useful to be able to routinely evaluate how much of the phenotypic variance these causal variants explain together and how that compares to regional heritability estimates from models with different assumptions about the genetic architecture. To our knowledge, an estimate of the regional heritability of the fine-mapped variants is not given by the existing probabilistic fine-mapping methods. In this work, we extended the FINEMAP software to output estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability by taking into account the LD structure among the variants and the posterior probability of each putative causal configuration of variants. We performed simulations to verify our implementation and to assess how existing heritability estimation methods BOLT and HESS work in the case where a genomic region truly contains only a few causal variants. Previously, BOLT and HESS have been tested under highly polygenic architectures and here we assessed how they perform when there is considerable regional heritability but its source is not polygenic. We see this as an important piece of information since our goal is to interpret what the possible differences in the regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS reveal about the genetic architecture of the region. We also considered highly polygenic settings where genetic effects would be distributed among numerous variants with tiny effects. In such settings, we expect that reduced statistical power to detect individual causal variants makes fine-mapping difficult and consequently also keeps the regional heritability estimate of FINEMAP low, which was confirmed by our results. Based on previous analyses [14], we expected that some existing methods, such as BOLT and HESS, could still provide reasonable heritability in such highly polygenic regions. Our simulation results show that FINEMAP is nearly unbiased for larger sample sizes and provides accurate uncertainty quantification of the regional heritability estimates when there are only a few causal variants in the region. With BOLT, there was an upward bias for the smallest heritability values possibly because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to be positive. BOLT overestimated the standard error and had wider confidence intervals compared to FINEMAP, likely due to the simulation setup which differed from the polygenic modeling assumptions of BOLT and was similar to the FINEMAP model. In simulations with 50 causal variants per region, we observed that FINEMAP underestimated the heritability, especially when both the regional heritability and the sample size were small. This is expected since the fine-mapping model assumes sparse genetic architecture, and therefore is not expected to perform well when there are as many as 50 causal variants with small effects. In this setting, BOLT typically provided smaller mean square error and better calibration of 95% intervals than FINEMAP. We also observed that the default regularization method applied by HESS induces a systematic downward bias and low precision in the estimates. The default regularization corresponds to using only the first 50 principal components of the correlation structure of the variants to remove noise present in the trailing components, especially when the LD structure does not match the GWAS summary statistics. A possible explanation for the downward bias is that the weight of the variants contributing to heritability may be weak on the leading principal components and therefore using the default settings in HESS misses important information. In our simulations, we had a perfect match between the LD structure and GWAS summary statistics and we observed that by deactivating the regularization method we could remove the bias for the smallest heritability levels. However, this could not solve the problem for the largest heritability level and led to larger confidence intervals that increased with GWAS sample size. In the protein data analysis, we also observed that deactivating regularization of HESS does not always work even when we have access to the original LD structure. Based on our simulations, our expectation in the analysis of protein data was that the FINEMAP heritability estimates would be bounded from below by the contribution from the variant with the lowest P-value alone and from above by polygenic and fixed-effect models, such as BOLT and HESS, that conceptually consider all variants causal. We indeed observed such a pattern with FINEMAP explaining 36% more regional heritability on average than the variant with the lowest P-value alone. The regional heritability estimates from BOLT tended to be lower than the values from FINEMAP in 58% of pQTLs (977 / 2,302 regions) in which FINEMAP estimated a heritability greater than 0.01 (2,302 / 14,182 regions). A possible explanation is that these pQTLs may contain a heritability contribution that is not highly polygenic and fine-mapping accurately captures it with our sample size of 28,008 individuals. In 78% of pQTLs (9,313 / 11,880 regions) in which regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP were less than 0.01 (11,880 / 14,182 regions), BOLT regional heritability estimates were larger compared to FINEMAP. Similar to our simulations, a part of the higher point estimates of BOLT may result from BOLT constraining the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence overestimating heritability values close to zero and/or FINEMAP not capturing the lower heritability levels in these pQTLs. The estimates from HESS with default regularization were on average 5% larger compared to FINEMAP. Deactivation of the regularization method of HESS increased the HESS estimates so that they became 57% larger than the values from FINEMAP. A possible explanation is the presence of (nearly) perfectly correlated variants in the pQTL regions making the correlation matrices not invertible or unstable in genomic regions with (nearly) perfectly correlated variants. An ultimate goal in genetics research is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants contributing to heritability and to obtain accurate effect sizes for them. The extensions for effect size and heritability estimation that we have introduced in the FINEMAP software provide a computationally efficient framework to deduce a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture. We expect that these new features prove useful as the accuracy of fine-mapping constantly increases with rapidly growing sample size of biobank-scale studies. We used data from the UKB [22] using the Application number 44257. Ethics approval for the UKB study was obtained from the North West Centre for Research Ethics Committee (11/ NW/0382). Proteomic profiling of the UKB was approved by the Access Subcommittee of UKB, under Access Management System Application No. 65851. All participants of the UKB provided written informed consent. The goal of statistical fine-mapping is to refine a large set of genetic variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of variants with direct effect on the phenotype by accounting for the complex correlations between the variants. Although we call the variants with such direct effects “causal”, we bear in mind that further laboratory experiments would be required to establish the exact biological mechanisms of those variants. The statistical framework in FINEMAP (see Web Resources) to infer causal variants is built on Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models [23] using Bayes factors. Previously [18], we derived the Bayes factor to assess the support for each combination of k variants denoted by γ, and hereafter called causal configuration, over the null configuration. Our previous derivation18 implemented in FINEMAP v.1.1, started with a likelihood approximation for the joint linear regression model for all variants in the region and assumed small enough effect sizes that we could ignore the differences in residual variance between causal configurations. In the following, we derive a corresponding Bayes factor by using a likelihood approximation of only the causal variants, which makes the effect size estimation feasible, and by allowing different residual variances for different configurations. For this, we assume the following Bayesian linear regression model for the causal configuration γ, (1) where y is a standardized vector with phenotypic values for n individuals (with is a matrix of dimension n×k with standardized genotypes at the variants, λγ are the additive effect sizes of the standardized variants, is the user-given prior variance for the effect sizes and is the point estimate of the residual variance in the multiple linear regression that we learn from the data (details below). Integrating out effect sizes λγ analytically yields the marginal likelihood of the causal configuration where we reduced computational complexity by applying the Matrix determinant lemma and Woodbury matrix identity on line 2. The computational complexity of evaluating the marginal likelihood can be further reduced substantially by replacing the phenotype-genotype data with GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations between variants [15–19]. That is, we replace individual-level data (y,X) with GWAS summary data in which case where is a vector of ratios of effect size estimates and their standard errors from individual univariate linear regressions of each variant in the causal configuration, is a matrix of pairwise sample correlations among the variants and is a diagonal matrix of estimates for residual variances in the univariate linear regressions. Thus, we can compute the Bayes factor to assess the support for a causal configuration γ over the null configuration γ0, that contains no variants, by using only GWAS summary data on variants included in the causal configuration γ Numerically, this Bayes factor agrees with our earlier derivation [18] when causal variants have small effect sizes and hence . With the current derivation of the Bayes factor, we can also account for causal variants with larger effect sizes by allowing for different residual variances for different configurations and we provide a simple way to extract the posterior distribution of the effect sizes as explained next. The posterior distribution of the effect sizes of variants included in a causal configuration is where and . An estimate of the heritability of a causal configuration γ is given by the ratio between the variance explained by the causal variants and the total variance of the phenotype, which we here compute conditional on the effect sizes λγ as (2) where the empirical estimate from the data equals zero because of centered genotypes. Hence our point estimate is and we compute the posterior distribution of by evaluating Eq (2) for each draw from the posterior for λγ. This approach allows us to obtain the mean, standard deviation and 95% credible interval (equal tail area interval) of the posterior. We expect high quality posterior inference if is a good approximation to the pairwise sample correlations computed from the original GWAS genotype data [24]. For quantitative traits, setting the estimates for residual variances in equal to one is a good approximation in genomic regions with small causal effects and FINEMAP v1.1 uses this approximation. However, this approach can lead to problems when causal variants have larger effect sizes [25]. Since FINEMAP v1.2, we account for different magnitudes of effect sizes by calculating, for each variant ℓ, the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance in univariate linear regression. If all variants individually account for less than heritability of 1%, we keep in Eq (1) fixed at a value of 1.0 and set the prior variance for the effect size equal to 0.052; this means that a causal variant contributes less than heritability of 1% with probability 0.95 [18]. Otherwise, we expect to see larger effect sizes. In this case, we set in Eq (1) equal to the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance from multiple linear regression of variants in the causal configuration γ. For each causal configuration, we further use an equidistant grid of four values for the prior variance with a lower bound at 0.052 and an upper bound where, with probability 0.95, a causal variant contributes less than the point estimate of heritability of a causal configuration γ of the variants with pairwise absolute correlations less than 0.95 that are marginally the most significant and that each contribute more than heritability of 1%. For each grid value, we compute the Bayes factor for assessing the evidence against the null configuration. We obtain the final Bayes factor by computing the average value of the individual Bayes factors. This model averaging corresponds to a uniform prior distribution on over the grid points. Our strategy for adapting to large effect sizes requires no actions from the user and therefore differs from the approach [25] of CAVIARBF v0.2.1 (see Web Resources) which requires user-given values for the prior standard deviation sλ. We compare FINEMAP v1.4 with CAVIARBF and FINEMAP v1.1 on simulated datasets with three causal variants among 150 variants in a genomic region (see “Simulations with GWAS regions”). Each dataset was analyzed with FINEMAP and CAVIARBF using default values and allowing for a maximum of four causal variants in the region. For CAVIARBF, we excluded the null configuration from the output and used multiple values 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 to specify the prior standard deviation sλ as recommended [25]. The Bayesian variable selection approach to fine-mapping causal variants is a hard combinatorial problem which precludes exhaustive enumeration of all possible causal configurations. In previous work [18], we tackled the combinatorial problem with Shotgun Stochastic Search [26] algorithm to identify a list of causal configurations which captures a large majority of the total posterior probability [18]. According to the Bayesian paradigm, we account for model uncertainty through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) [27]. BMA combines inference about a quantity common to all models by averaging the posterior distribution of that quantity under each model using posterior model probabilities as weights. Using BMA, we compute the PIP for the ℓth variant by summing up the posterior probability of all causal configurations in which this variant is included. We model-average estimates of heritability to quantify the contribution of causal variants. Examples of other useful model-averaged estimates are the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation of the ℓth variant. We output marginalized shrinkage estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation by averaging over all causal configurations assuming that the effect size of the ℓth variant is zero if the variant is absent from a causal configuration. We also output the conditional estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation conditional on inclusion by averaging over only those causal configurations in which the ℓth variant is included. The magnitude of the conditional model-averaged estimate of the ℓth variant is much larger than the shrinkage model-averaged estimate if the PIP for the ℓth variant is small. Variance component models are extensively used for heritability estimation under a polygenic model assumption. We performed regional heritability estimation from individual-level genotype-phenotype data with BOLT v2.3 (see Web Resources) using default settings. In genome-wide analyses, we used an LD pruned set of variants (—indep-pairwise 1000 100 0.8, see Web Resources) while in regional analyses we used an unpruned set of variants to maintain comparability to other methods that estimate regional heritability. Since the model assumption of polygenicity may not hold in any particular genomic region [14], we also estimated regional heritability with HESS v0.5.2 (see Web Resources) to avoid assumptions about causal effect sizes. HESS requires GWAS summary statistics and genotype data to compute pairwise correlations between the variants to account for LD. To keep the allele coding between GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations consistent and maintain comparability with FINEMAP, we modified HESS to read in the same pre-computed pairwise correlations obtained from the original GWAS genotype data as we use in FINEMAP. We further used marginal effect size estimates on the standardized scale as input to HESS (personal communication with the authors of HESS). We ran HESS on approximately independent LD blocks [28] using all variants in the genomic region and default settings. We also ran HESS without default adjustment for noise in the LD matrix by setting the command-line flags—max-num-eig m and—min-eigval 10−8, as recommended by the authors of HESS, where m is the number of variants in the genomic region. We used genotype data on 426,844 individuals of EUR ancestry (see Web Resources) provided by UKB. For documentation about imputation of the UKB genotype data see Web Resources. We retained genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1% and excluded related individuals with KING’s [29] kinship coefficient greater than 0.0442 using a greedy algorithm that maximizes the final sample size. This left us with 374,073 samples in UKB. We used plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins measured with the antibody-based Olink Explore 3072 Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) across a randomly chosen set of 32,867 unrelated individuals of European ancestry included in UKB. Details about the proteomics data are given in Sun et al. [30]. Protein level concentrations were adjusted by age, age2, sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, batch, UKB assessment center, UKB genetic array, time between blood sampling and measurement and the first 20 genetic principal components using a linear regression model. Regression residuals were normalized using a rank-based transformation to the standard Normal distribution. The UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Projects (UKB-PPP) used REGENIE (see Web Resources) to test genome-wide associations with 2,940 proteins. We defined the level of statistical significance as P < 1.7×10−11 corresponding to the standard genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10−8) corrected for the number of proteins analyzed (5 × 10−8 / 2940 = 1.7×10−11). The pQTLs were defined through clumping ±1Mb around statistically significant variants, excluding the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which is treated as one locus due to complex and extensive LD patterns. Physically overlapping regions were merged into one, deeming the variant with the lowest P-value as the lead variant. We estimated regional heritability with BOLT, HESS and FINEMAP across 14,189 pQTLs from the UKB-PPP in 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. Our motivation to use unrelated individuals is to prevent the possibility of bias across the three methods. For FINEMAP and HESS we generated summary statistics with a linear model implemented in PLINK2 (see Web Resources). With FINEMAP we either allowed for thirty causal variants or only one causal variant to estimate the heritability captured by the lead variant. The polygenic component of heritability was estimated with BOLT using genome-wide variants outside of regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb. In the Paraoxonase 1 cis-pQTL, we performed a stepwise conditional analysis implemented in PLINK2 by first conditioning on the variant with the lowest P-value, hereafter called the lead variant, and then iteratively adding to the model the variant with the lowest conditional P-value until no further variant reached the standard genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10−8) or until we had conducted a pre-specified number of iterations. To assess how different methods estimate regional heritability we performed comprehensive simulations over genomic regions chosen from GWAS meta-analyses for coronary artery disease (CAD) [31], Crohn’s disease (CD) [32], lipid traits (LIPs) [33], schizophrenia (SCZ) [34], and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [35]. For each study, we retained the lead variants outside the HLA region with a marginal P-value less than 5 × 10−8 and selected 100 lead variants (18 from CAD, 20 from CD, 21 from LIPs, 21 from SCZ, and 20 from T2D) for further analyses. Around each lead variant, we defined genomic regions of 3 Mb. We considered the following fine-mapping setting: Increasing regional heritability (h2 = 0.00025, 0.0015, 0.05, 0.5) Increasing number of causal variants (m = 3, 50) Increasing GWAS sample size (n = 5,000, 50,000, 300,000) A total of 1,000 datasets (10 replicates per each region) were generated under each of the 24 combinations of scenarios H, M and N using the following linear model where C is the set of causal variants, gc the vector of standardized genotypes from 374,073 UKB individuals at the cth causal variant, βc the standardized effect size of the cth variant and ϵ is Normal noise with mean 0 and variance . Causal variants were randomly chosen. In datasets with three causal variants, the joint causal effect sizes were specified such that in the true causal configuration, the three variants accounted for 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4% of the regional heritability, respectively (That is, the effect size of a standardized genotype variable of a causal variant was (h2×p)1/2, where h2 is the regional heritability and p is the proportion of heritability accounted for by the variant). These per-variant proportions were chosen from a meta-analysis of the association between MC4R locus and body mass index [36]. In simulations with fifty causal variants, joint causal effect sizes were specified such that each causal variant accounted for the same proportion of regional heritability. For each set of 1,000 simulations, we report the average heritability estimates and the average standard error (BOLT, HESS) or posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP). We also assess the uncertainty of heritability estimates across 100 simulated datasets of the same region with causal variants kept fixed. For 95% credible and confidence intervals (normal approximations), we calculate their coverage as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability. We also compute the RMSE defined as the square root of the average squared deviation of the estimated heritability from the true level of heritability. RMSE summarizes both bias and precision of the estimation procedures with smaller RMSE values indicating better performance.

Title: Washington Post ‘rudderless’ as Bezos’ paper engulfed by layoffs, talent exodus ahead of Trump’s second term
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/us-news/washington-post-rudderless-as-bezos-paper-engulfed-by-layoffs-talent-exodus-ahead-of-trumps-second-term/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T12:06:46Z
Full Content:
The new year has already become a rough one for The Washington Post as its years-long identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency. While newsroom tensions and money woes have been persistent, they were taken to new heights following Bezos’ appointment of Will Lewis as The Post’s publisher and CEO. Tasked to revitalize the paper’s cratering business model, Lewis had some choice words for his staff in a June 2024 meeting following the ousting of its executive editor Sally Buzbee. “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff … I can’t sugarcoat it anymore,” Lewis said at the time. Fast-forward to 2025, and Lewis has alienated himself from his newsroom. “The company feels rudderless right now,” one staffer told Fox News Digital. “Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous ‘no one’s reading your stuff’ meeting from last year, he hasn’t named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn’t communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed.” The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck’s Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital “that’s apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff.” “In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once — in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate,” the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis’ blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos’ decision to halt The Post’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn’t even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos’ decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos’ move the “single most disastrous” management decision in the paper’s history. “The morale is very low, of course,” Farhi told Fox News Digital. “Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But it strikes me that they’ve made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse.” Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks “with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding,” current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post’s health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a “vote of no confidence” in publisher Will Lewis. “These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper,” he said. “You know, politics isn’t the only thing the Washington Post does, but it’s a big part of the franchise. And when you’re losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you’ve developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it’s really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they’ll hire back. They’ll find people. Will they be as good? That’s a big question.” What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor’s Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were “sold” on the idea that The Post’s mission was to be a “#Resistance newspaper.” However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. “Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose,” the Amazon founder wrote in October. “Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility.” Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an “unprecedented behind-the-scenes look” at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. The Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump’s feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post’s in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn’t cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes’ resignation. “I couldn’t possibly dissent more strongly from that policy,” Wemple reacted on Monday. “The Post’s willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it’s something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated.” In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren’t looking to leave. “I’d like to try to ride it through,” one said. “I love the company, love the people I work with and for.” The staffer urged Lewis to “treat his employees like adults.” “Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent,” they said. One former staffer slammed the “self-inflicted” damage being done by their once-beloved employer. “It’s very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled,” the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting “neither is willing to take a stand” against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray’s new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. “It’s truly tragic,” they said. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. Fox News’ David Rutz contributed to this report. Advertisement

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Turmoil Across The Pond as Bitcoin Defends $93K After $300B Wipeout

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The total cryptocurrency industry is now under $3.2 trillion in market capitalization, as over $300 billion has been wiped out since Jan. 6, taking away all early gains for the year, according to the TradingView metric TOTAL. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) is now hovering above $93,000 but has been making a succession of higher lows starting from Dec. 30. Adding to the bearish sentiment, market is digesting the unconfirmed reports from DB News which suggest that the U.S. government has been given the green light to liquidate as much as 69,370 BTC ($6.5B) from the Silk Road seizure. This makes the political theatre between the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations even more intriguing, as president-elect Donald Trump, who is just few days away from being sworn in on Jan. 20, vowed not to sell any of the bitcoin held by U.S. authorities, which, according to Glassnode data, amounts to 187,236 BTC. The onslaught in the crypto industry stems from an extremely high DXY index, above 109, which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to a weighted basket of major foreign currencies. In addition, for a brief moment, the U.S. treasury yields were rising before retreating slightly yesterday. The benchmark for 10-year yield was as high as 4.73%. The inflation concerns that paddled the selloff in the broader market is picking up alongside growth expectations, LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk. "The combination of rising growth and inflation expectations alongside rising term premia as the market struggles to digest huge treasury supply to fund these deficits is pushing U.S. yields higher, which is dragging global yields higher, excluding China." However, turmoil is occurring across the pond in the U.K., with gilt yields continuing to march higher this morning. Records were set today, as the 30-year U.K. jumped to almost 5.45%, the highest level since 1998. While the benchmark U.K. 10-year challenged 4.95%, the highest since 2008, the treasury was forced to intervene in the market to calm investors, according to reports from The Telegraph. LondonCryptoClub mentioned the key reasons for the turmoil, "the U.K. is under pressure after a disastrous budget which has increased borrowing needs with little to no positive growth impact, exacerbating the negative debt/GDP dynamics and driving a larger fiscal deficit." As a result, the not-so-Great British pound, falling yet again, is now 1.22 against the dollar, the lowest level since November 2023, and has fallen almost 4% in the past month. Today, Jan. 9, is declared a mourning day in the U.S. to remember the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Therefore, the stock market will be closed. So, all eyes will be turning to the jobs report on Friday. The market is in a good news is bad news scenario as rate cuts for 2025 get pushed back with only one rate cut expected for 2025. A strong jobs report could remove this rate cut, with unemployment expected to come in at 4.2%, while nonfarm payroll is estimated at 154,000. A hot jobs print could send the dollar to 110, putting further pressure on risk-assets. Stay alert! By Shaurya MalwaA parody token just got its own parody. AI Agents upstart ai16z, a platform mimicking venture fund a16z that uses AI to manage user funds, saw a mockery of its token raffle among smallcap speculators in the past day, running to a peak of $130 million market capitalization as of European morning hours. Where ai16z tried to blend AI with investment, LLM — short for “Large Language Model” laughs at the very concept, suggesting that if AI can be anything, it can certainly be a meme with no real utility. X users were quick to dub LLM as the "McDonald's version of $ai16z," mixing fast food with AI, creating a narrative where the only intelligence was in the marketing. Some thoughts about $LLM: it's the perfect token to mock $ai16z.1. It uses an AI-related term but is actually a funny meme without any utility, much like $fartcoin.2. It emerged organically and has a perfect distribution—everyone had a chance to buy it even before pf bonding.… It has no inherent utility or technological backing; its value is purely speculative and community-driven, based on the meme's popularity and the humor it brings to the crypto conversation. I bought it because it was funny — But now, it’s turned into a community + the ticker is ideal for the meta we’re in + the word play on the ticker can’t be funnier. AI Agent projects virtuals (VIRTUALS), ai16z (AI16Z) and the broader category are down more than 20% since peak on average in the past weeks amid criticism of their claimed AI models, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.

Title: Stocks are priced for 'perfection' and more vulnerable to a correction, Goldman warns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now. Read more: TD Ameritrade's former CEO makes his 2025 market prediction For starters, Oppenheimer pointed out that the speed of the recent rises in stock prices likely reflects much of the good news that Wall Street is expecting on growth in 2025. Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now.

Title: Amazon and Meta: Wolfe Chooses the Best Internet Stocks to Buy

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year. For Wolfe’s Khajuria, the key here is that Meta’s combination of social apps, its strength in video apps, and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a ‘top pick.’ As she puts it, “We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside. Our thesis: i) We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis, we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests. by MSD $B; ii) We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD $Bs with monetization starting in ’25; iii) TikTok divestiture remains uncertain, but should that happen, we see 8 to 10% upside to EPS; iv) Cleaner AI narrative as multi-year investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential.” Bottom line, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Meta, and backs that with a $730 price target, showing her confidence in a 16% upside potential over the next 12 months. Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file, and these break down to 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $617.89 and the average target price of $683.72 implies a one-year potential gain of 10.5%.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year.

Title: Washington Post 'rudderless' as Bezos' paper engulfed by layoffs, talent exodus ahead of Trump's second term
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-rudderless-bezos-paper-engulfed-layoffs-talent-exodus-ahead-trumps-second-term
Time Published: 2025-01-09T10:00:16Z
Full Content:
Fox News' Howard Kurtz joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on Jeff Bezos' decision to not have The Washington Post endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. 2025 has already become a rough year for The Washington Post as its yearslong identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency. While newsroom tensions and money woes have been persistent, they were taken to new heights following Bezos' appointment of Will Lewis as The Post's publisher and CEO. Tasked to revitalize the paper's cratering business model, Lewis had some choice words for his staff in a June 2024 meeting following the ousting of its executive editor Sally Buzbee. "We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff ... I can’t sugarcoat it anymore," Lewis said at the time. WASHINGTON POST BEGINS LAYOFFS, CUTTING 4 PERCENT OF WORKFORCE Fast-forward to 2025, and Lewis has alienated himself from his newsroom. A Washington Post staffer slammed the paper's publisher and CEO Will Lewis for his absence from the newsroom as the news organization continues to face turmoil. (Elliott O'Donovan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) "The company feels rudderless right now," one staffer told Fox News Digital. "Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous 'no one's reading your stuff' meeting from last year, he hasn't named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn't communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed." The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck's Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital "that's apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff." "In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once -- in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate," the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis' blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos' decision to halt The Post's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn't even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. WAPO STAFFER UNSURE PAPER CAN RECOVER AS BEZOS-OWNED OUTLET SHEDS 250,000 SUBSCRIBERS OVER ENDORSEMENT FIASCO Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos' decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos' move the "single most disastrous" management decision in the paper's history. "The morale is very low, of course," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. But it strikes me that they've made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse." The decision by billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos to quash the endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was called the "single most disastrous move" by management in the paper's history. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks "with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding," current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post's health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a "vote of no confidence" in publisher Will Lewis. "These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper," he said. "You know, politics isn't the only thing the Washington Post does, but it's a big part of the franchise. And when you're losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you've developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it's really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they'll hire back. They'll find people. Will they be as good? That's a big question." WASHINGTON POST IN ‘DISARRAY’ AFTER CARTOONIST QUITS, STAFF EXODUS What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor's Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were "sold" on the idea that The Post's mission was to be a "#Resistance newspaper." However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose," the Amazon founder wrote in October. "Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an "unprecedented behind-the-scenes look" at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. Washington Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after the paper refused to publish an illustration mocking its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. (Screenshot/CNN/AnnTelnaes) The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump's feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post's in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn't cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes' resignation. "I couldn't possibly dissent more strongly from that policy," Wemple reacted on Monday. "The Post's willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it's something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated." In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren't looking to leave. "I'd like to try to ride it through," one said. "I love the company, love the people I work with and for." WAPO WRITER REBUKES NEW POLICY ON PAPER NOT COVERING ITSELF: ‘I COULDN’T POSSIBLY DISSENT MORE STRONGLY' Washington Post acting executive editor Matt Murray said he implemented a new "policy" that the paper should not cover itself. (Robert Miller/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The staffer urged Lewis to "treat his employees like adults." "Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent," they said. One former staffer slammed the "self-inflicted" damage being done by their once-beloved employer. "It's very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled," the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting "neither is willing to take a stand" against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray's new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. "It's truly tragic," they said. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' David Rutz contributed to this report. Joseph A.

While the crypto world is eager for another monumental bull run, the spotlight is shifting to a promising newer platform: DTX Exchange. With a presale price of just $0.14, this platform is turning heads and gaining traction daily. Analysts are hailing DTX as a hidden gem with the potential to disrupt the decentralized finance (DeFi) market and deliver significant gains. This article discusses how DTX Exchange is poised to be the best ICO of 2025 and the largest altcoin movement yet. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Game-Changer in DeFi Space The crypto market is full of numerous investment promises. DTX Exchange aims to redefine the trading landscape focused on versatility and user-friendliness. This best ICO bridges the gap between the financial markets and cryptos, empowering users with access to over 120,000 instruments (stocks, forex, bonds, and commodities). DTX Exchange could also bring true real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, where users can invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other tangible assets. This integration will potentially attract institutional investors and boost its value to the upside. Another innovative feature that sets DTX apart is its 1000x leverage feature. Here, it offers traders unmatched profit potential while maintaining privacy through KYC-free trading. Unlike many platforms that compromise between centralization and decentralization, DTX blends the advantages of both, making it a pioneer in hybrid trading. DTX’s Staggering $11.3 Million Presale Makes It The Best ICO The trading platform is built on its proprietary blockchain, VulcanX, which helps foster innovation within the DTX ecosystem. Interestingly, its blockchain testnet has demonstrated remarkable performance, reaching over 100,000 transactions per second. Regarding its presale, DTX Exchange has amassed over $11.3 million in funding. With DTX tokens available at $0.14, this project represents an incredible value proposition. Analysts predict that the token could easily surpass $1 shortly after listing, with long-term targets projecting a potential 10x to 50x increase after presale. A major milestone for DTX Exchange is its CoinMarketCap listing, a move that has increased visibility and trading volume. Following this listing, experts suggest DTX’s market capitalization could skyrocket to $1 billion, aligning it with top-tier altcoins. Moreover, whispers of partnerships with industry giants like BlackRock hint at significant institutional backing. Such collaborations could amplify DTX’s credibility and pave the way for listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. What Sets DTX Apart In A Crowded Market? While the crypto space is teeming with altcoins, DTX Exchange distinguishes itself through innovation, practicality, and strategic execution and becomes the best ICO. Its focus on bridging traditional and crypto markets and features like high leverage and tokenized RWAs could make it uniquely positioned to thrive in 2025’s bullish landscape. Additionally, the platform’s commitment to decentralization resonates with the ethos of the crypto community. Its secure infrastructure may appeal to institutions seeking reliable blockchain solutions. Key Takeaways The crypto market thrives on early opportunities, and DTX Exchange might be a compelling prospect this year. Its presale price of $0.14 offers a chance to get it early before it skyrockets into a multi-billion-dollar venture. Interestingly, DTX Exchange has all the ingredients for long-term success, from its innovative hybrid trading model to its ambitious global expansion plans- making it the best ICO of the year. As this best ICO gears up for its top-tier exchange listing, investors may need to act now and get in at what experts call a steal.

Title: Private equity wants a piece of your 401(k) — and hopes Trump can make it happen

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Private equity firms are hoping that the new Trump administration makes it easier for them access to something they have long wanted: your 401(k). Wall Street investment giants view Main Street retirement savings as a way to boost demand for non-listed illiquid bets that aren’t traded on any public exchange. Such investments include real estate funds, private credit, and leveraged buyouts of companies. Typically, private equity firms such as Apollo (APO), Blackstone (BX), and KKR (KKR) pool money from high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as endowments and public pensions to make these bets. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) What they have long wanted to tap is more than $12 trillion currently housed in defined-contribution plans that workers rely on for their retirement nest eggs, such as 401(k)s. The Biden administration has not warmed to that idea, but industry watchers expect that to change under Donald Trump's second term. He is expected to broadly loosen regulations that affect the world of financial services. "We’ll make the case for a pro-growth regulatory regime that supports small businesses and provides more opportunity to everyday investors," said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of private equity lobbying group American Investment Council. The argument for such a change is that private equity funds could give everyday investors more diversification away from public markets and a shot at bigger returns — in exchange for some illiquidity. Read more: How much should I contribute to my 401(k)? The reasoning aligns with broader concerns many investors have over the historically high valuation of the current stock market and the concentration of Big Tech stocks. Of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 index (^GSPC), all but Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) are tech giants. Together those 10 account for 37% of the index. Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo, has argued that too many investors are relying on the performance of too few public companies. "Should we get access to 401(k) through broad-based reform or regulatory change or regulatory encouragement, I believe that would be upside not just for us but for the entire industry," Rowan told analysts in November. Today, both private and public assets carry risks and rewards, Rowan told Yahoo Finance later that same month, with more companies opting to go private than public. "The biggest trend in our industry is investors, individual investors, and institutional investors looking at their fixed income bucket and saying to themselves, why is this 100% public?" Others in his industry have made similar points. "I totally agree with our brethren at Apollo," BlackRock (BLK) CFO Martin Small said in December at a Goldman Sachs conference, when discussing the topic of putting private loans into retirement portfolios. Getting private equity into 401(k)s "is a big opportunity" and "just makes sense," KKR co-CEO Scott Nuttall said at the same Goldman conference in New York. The argument against opening retirement savings to private equity is that the funds can be riskier than plain-vanilla index funds and are less liquid, making it difficult to get money out if things go sideways. Private equity also isn’t cheap, as fees can eat into investment gains. Many private equity firms charge investors fees that amount to 2% of assets and 20% of any profits. There is no law stating that private equity can’t be a part of 401(k) offerings that millions of Americans rely on for their retirement savings, but what the industry will likely want is specific guidance from the Labor Department stating that such investments can be acceptable alternatives for these accounts. The first Trump administration said as much in 2020. But the Biden administration’s Labor Department reversed that guidance by saying it didn’t recommend it. Any new guidance on this front from Washington may also need to come with legal liability protection for retirement plan sponsors and administrators, Nuttall said in December. They are "clearly going to need some comfort for themselves from a litigation risk," he added.

Title: Garry Ringrose confident Leinster can balance the yin and yang of attack and defence

Garry Ringrose is hoping that any rugby chat in 2025 relates to on-pitch exploits. A couple of shoulder injuries, in a Champions Cup game against the Leicester Tigers in January last year and then on his return in a cameo appearance as a replacement on the wing for Ireland in their final Six Nations game against Scotland, scuppered the season from a playing perspective. He did come back in time to start Leinster’s URC semi-final defeat to the Bulls in June. Since then he has appeared in all five Test matches for Ireland, starting three of the five games from the second Test victory over the Springboks in Durban and the Autumn Nations Series internationals at the Aviva Stadium against New Zealand and Argentina. Seven appearances for Leinster this season, including two in Europe, underline his rude health. If there was any lingering doubt his thumping tackle on another Blackrock alumnus AJ MacGinty, the Bristol outhalf, expunged that notion. On Sunday he returns to Stade Marcel Deflandre where he helped the Irish province to the first of two wins last season over a club, La Rochelle, that had previously proved a nemesis. Leinster’s defence coach Jacques Nienaber had started work a couple of weeks before that pool fixture in December 2023, but his influence was already palpable in a rain-drenched arm wrestle. While there was no silverware Leinster continued to evolve, searching for a sweet spot where defence and attack are equally formidable. The trick was in trying not to rob Peter to pay Paul when it came to focusing on one aspect of the game more so than the other. Ringrose was asked about maintaining that equilibrium this week. “It’s always a little bit elusive, any given week, any given day you’re trying to get the balance right, when you have the ball, when you don’t, what will help you to win the game.” There are weeks when one side of the ball gets a little more play in training. He offered an example. “It can happen. The Bristol week, we would have shone the light defensively a lot on how many tries they score, their attack, how dangerous they are; that would have maybe been a week you shine the light defensively more. “Any given week you’re only ever doing the best you can to win so it’s always an interesting challenge. It makes it exciting though when you’re testing yourself against the best, (the likes of) La Rochelle, you have to get them both (attack and defence) spot on if you want a chance of winning, you can’t go all-in on one or the other.” Drilling down a little further into the constituent parts, Ringrose explained that the evolution process never stands still. “Essentially, defensively working with Jacques (Nienaber) we’re still learning and there is still things we’re maybe not getting right, trying to be quicker and become more instinctive. We are repping that in training as much as possible. And then in games you get exposed to it with a bit more consequence obviously. We like to think we’ve improved and got better defensively. In attack guess the score line probably flattered us (in the win over Munster). Whether we can get things to click a little bit better is the challenge for us. “The last time I played (against La Rochelle) was a wet day over there, there wasn’t much attacking, there was a lot of kicking, a lot of set piece and scrums and mauls and picking and going close to the line. We’ll have to be ready from that perspective, but if it is a bit drier (we must) get our set piece starters right and then because kicking is a big part of the game for us and them, be ready to go off the back of that.” It was put to him that maybe the attack might have suffered with more emphasis on the defence. Ringrose said: “I wouldn’t...I don’t think I’d use the word suffered. It’s like a tug-of-war between the two (attack and defence) in any given week. “Tyler (Bleyendaal) wants his minutes for us and same with Jacques; they are working unbelievably closely and they’re almost running meetings symbiotically. So I guess it’s always something they’re trying to get better at.” Sunday’s match between two unbeaten teams in Europe offers another benchmarking opportunity to see how that evolution in style is progressing.

Title: Credit Firm SC Lowy Boots Private Debt Focus With New Fund

(Bloomberg) -- Credit investor SC Lowy Financial HK Ltd. will pivot more toward private credit and close a fund focused on public securities, in a bid to seize more opportunities in the burgeoning asset class. Hong Kong-based SC Lowy said in a statement Thursday that it will begin a gradual wind down of the Primary Investment Fund, which focuses on market-making activities in public securities across Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Europe. In its place, the firm will in mid-2025 launch a new interval fund, which focuses on direct lending among other securities. The timing of SC Lowy’s shift into private credit, notably in Asia and the Middle East, comes as secondary loan market and high-yield bond opportunities dwindle, the firm said in the statement. SC Lowy’s bet on private markets follows the footsteps of other global players, including BlackRock Inc., Tikehau Capital and Navis Capital Partners. These institutions have set up private funds in hopes of capturing higher returns in Asia Pacific, a region that represents just a fraction of the $1.6 trillion global private credit market. SC Lowy, which currently has $1.6 billion assets under management, has invested in private credit since 2011, according to their website. The firm’s Strategic Investments II and Strategic Investments IV funds, which focus on the asset class, had delivered net internal rates of return of 12.45% as of June 30, 2024 and 15.7%, as of Sept. 30, 2024, respectively, since the funds’ inceptions in 2021 and late 2023, according to a December document seen by Bloomberg.

(Bloomberg) -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off big US banks from municipal-bond deals after a slew of Wall Street firms exited a controversial climate-finance alliance. In 2023, his office announced that it was reviewing the policies of finance companies that were members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which he has repeatedly criticized. That stemmed from Texas legislation that sought to punish financial firms for engaging in what it viewed as a “boycott” of the oil and gas industries. In recent weeks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they’re quitting the alliance. Paxton’s office said late Tuesday that its reviews of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan will be closed. Those firms are major underwriters of state and local debt in Texas, one of the biggest markets for muni deals. The Texas attorney general’s office approves most public bond offerings before they’re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. Still, the attorney general’s office said in a different notice that Bank of America and JPMorgan are still under review over their firearm policies. A separate GOP law restricts government work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities. Lauren Bianchi, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said in a statement that the firm is proud of its role supporting the state’s energy sector and economy. “We look forward to continuing to help drive growth and prosperity in the state,” the statement said. Representatives for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. In a statement, Paxton’s office said the alliance pushes members to advance “destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors.” “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton said. Separately, a group of state attorneys general, led by Paxton, sued BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. in November for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investment policies. After the suit was filed, BlackRock said the notion that it would invest “money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” (Updates with details on firearm review in the fourth paragraph and comment from JPMorgan in the fifth paragraph) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative at a Marketing Association of Thailand seminar, emphasizing the program would operate within existing legal frameworks and wouldn't require new legislation. "We won't do anything that is illegal," Chunhavajira was quoted as saying, according to a report from The Nation Thailand. The development signals how the country's approach to digital assets is changing as it seeks to maintain its competitive edge in global finance and tourism. Chunhavajira reportedly highlighted how recent geopolitical conflicts have disrupted global economies, noting that for individuals fleeing political tensions and seeking to purchase property in Thailand, "paying with Bitcoin could be a much simpler process." In any case, the pilot program will allow foreign tourists to register their crypto through Thai exchanges and use it for purchases after identity verification. A clearing house would handle the conversion of digital assets to Thai baht. A separate report from Bangkok Post says that Chunhavajira understands how Bitcoin's limited supply has driven "strong demand" globally. "This indicates more than half of the codes have likely been forgotten, leaving about $1 trillion in liquidity available for exchange," the report quotes Chunhavajira as saying. Decrypt reached out to the report's authors for further information. The move comes as Thailand aims to capitalize on its tourism recovery, with visitor numbers expected to reach 39.8 million in 2025, up from 35-36 million in 2024, Chunhavajira said. Meanwhile, major economies have already accumulated significant Bitcoin reserves, and public companies such as BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and Metaplanet have been piling up. Industry experts, however, warn that Thailand risks falling behind in the broader crypto "arms race." Bitkub Capital founder and CEO Jirayut Srupsrisopa said in an interview with Thai PBS World that the country needs to take action on a strategic Bitcoin reserve. "The cost of inaction is going to be expensive," Srupsrisopa said. "The longer it takes us to decide, the more expensive it will cost the country." Srupsrisopa also claimed that Thailand has “one of the highest crypto adoption per capita” levels globally, with at least one of every seven people having downloaded their app. Meanwhile, grassroots crypto adoption is already taking place in some parts of Thailand. In the Huay Phueng district of Kalasin province, a local community has embraced Bitcoin payments, with over 80 businesses accepting it for everyday transactions.

Title: What to know about Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing platform and computing, networking, and storage services
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-azure
Time Published: 2025-01-09T03:14:02Z
Full Content:
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that offers a range of cloud-based computing, networking, and data storage services. Microsoft Azure boasts "solutions that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers." Crystal clear, right? Don't worry, we'll break it down for you, but first just to clarify, Azure is indeed a computing platform, not just a storage platform. In short, Azure lets you do things that require much more processing power than your computer has because the computing is done far from your desk, couch, or that coffee shop table. Now for the longer view. The same company that brought you PowerPoint, Word, and more, launched Azure as Windows Azure back in 2010, rebranding it to Microsoft Azure in 2014. With the launch of the company's AI interface Copilot in 2023, using Azure became easier than ever, as the smart chat interface can help less tech-savvy users take advantage of Azure's many uses. Azure is now used by a plethora of small and large businesses and organizations. Indeed, Azure has become such a valuable platform and suite of services that Microsoft offers certifications in dozens of different Azure features and softwares to help IT professionals, developers, and engineers learn the intricacies. Azure has become a critical component of Microsoft's business model since its 2010 launch, with executives often boasting of Azure's revenues in earnings calls. However, Azure has not been immune from the turbulence within the tech industry in the post-pandemic era. Large rounds of Microsoft layoffs tend to be a "when" and not an "if" sort of thing, so it was hardly a great shock when hundreds of Azure employees were laid off in early summer 2024. The large round of job cuts specifically targeted workers in the Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering departments, and were part of a pattern of layoffs begun in 2023 and expanded in 2024. Azure allows you to use an already immense and ever-growing catalog of services; it would be way too heavy of a lift to cover them all here, so we will showcase a few of the things you can do via this cloud computing platform. Azure AI Search: This service allows you to conduct advanced, tailored smart searches and build up a vectored database of relevant retrieved information. Azure Open Datasets: Host and share curated datasets that are honed and refined through machine learning, growing more accurate over time. Speaker Recognition: This service allows for the ever-improving recognition of speech and integrates spoken words into programming, documents, and more. It is multilingual, of course. Azure AI Content Safety: Azure can automatically watch out for images, text, and video content that might be inappropriate — or simply irrelevant — and filter them out of your content. Most Azure products use a pay-as-you-go model rather than fixed rates for different products or a flat monthly fee. Your costs could be as low as pennies each month for basic cloud storage or the managed hosting of a simple website or well into the thousands of dollars for enterprise-level use of myriad AI-enabled products. Many Azure products can also be used for free. New users can enjoy 25 services free for 12 months, while others remain free at all times to all people. These include API management, the Azure AI Bot Service, and the Azure AI Metrics Advisor, to name just a few. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the heavy hitter in cloud computing and storage, arguably leading the way in networking, cloud storage, mobile development, and cybersecurity. Google Cloud Platform GCP is big on data analysis and arguably allows the easiest user experience and more seamless interaction with products created by other brands. Microsoft Azure, for its part, provides vastly scalable and efficient software products, and it's usually cheaper than Google Cloud or AWS. Jump to

Nvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the rampant spending on AI infrastructure. The company’s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the most talked about technology in tech circles and that has catapulted the stock close to its all-time highs. For many, the stock continues to be an expensive bet and at current levels, it is hard to pull the trigger and invest in the company's stock. If you’re in the same boat and find it hard to buy a stock at its all-time highs, you may want to consider investing in companies that work with Nvidia. Nvidia’s accelerated computing technologies are powering many companies' products, especially those related to AI and autonomy. Workers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress. Toyota has a strong history of partnerships with Nvidia. Continuing that tradition, the car maker announced a new collaboration with the semiconductor giant. The firm’s upcoming vehicles will feature automated driving powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin Supercomputer and DriveOS operating system. The Drive AGX supercomputer can process sensor data in real-time, which the DriveOS can then also process in real-time. This AI processing is expected to offer automated driving features that will take Toyota closer to achieving autonomy on roads. The plan to put Nvidia’s supercomputer in Toyota vehicles was thought of nearly 7 years ago. Since then, Nvidia has helped Toyota by offering automation through the cloud. The collaboration now moves to offering the same through an in-car system, which should massively improve the efficiency of the system. Toyota has been struggling to deal with potential tariffs, eroding margins due to labor costs, and a price war in China. Investors would hope the Nvidia partnership will help the company tackle these challenges. Overall TM ranks 4th on our list of the companies that partnered with NVIDIA this month. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Garry Ringrose looking for elusive balance between attack and defence for Leinster

Garry Ringrose has added defensive steel to his silky skills. Photo; Sportsfile Perhaps no player embodies Leinster’s journey from fluid attacking force to gnarled defensive machine like Garry Ringrose. When he emerged from Blackrock College and the Leinster Academy, Ringrose was the kind of kid you wouldn’t mind your daughter bringing home. Now, he’s the type of fella you wouldn’t like to meet in a dark alley. Physically, he still looks the same but at 28 he appears to relish the contact more than the gliding runs outside defences. The 2025 edition of Leinster is a meaner, leaner version of its former self and the players seem to be relishing the defensive side of the game. Nobody sets the tone like the outside centre, whose wince-inducing tackling in the Bristol Bears and Munster games left a mark. The fear is that the team has lost something in attack, but Ringrose believes they’re getting the balance right. “It’s like a tug of war between the two, and any given week Tyler [Bleyendaal] wants his minutes for us and same with Jacques [Nienaber]. They’re actually working unbelievably close and they’re almost meeting symbiotically but it’s always something we’re trying to get better at,” he said. “Defensively, working with Jacques, we’re still learning and there’s still stuff we’re maybe not getting right and working at and trying to be quicker and and be more instinctive so we’re just repping that in training as much as possible. “In games, you get exposed to that with a bit more consequence, obviously. So we like to think we’ve improved and got better defensively and then attack, I guess, the scoreline probably flatters. “Whether we can get things to click a little bit better is the challenge for us. “It was obviously a wet day the last time we played over there [in La Rochelle] and that’s the last time I was playing [against them]. There wasn’t a lot of attacking; there was a lot of kicking, a lot of set-pieces and scrums and mauls and going close to the line, so we’ll have to be ready from that perspective. “If it is a bit dryer, get our starters, our set-piece starters right and then because kicking is a big part of the game for us to be ready to go off the back of that.” Ringrose is relishing his defensive role. “It’s interesting from the perspective of preparing to play against South Africa in the past and trying to understand what Jesse Kriel or [Lukhanyo] Am were doing and why and obviously talking to him and learning off him it makes sense,” he explained. “A lot of it, I know No 13 position is said to be difficult to defend but a lot of it depends on what the guys around me are doing. “It allows me to make reads or even the ones that maybe I’ve missed, or any of us have missed, the wingers and the full-back kind of cover for that. “Maybe it’s not as glaring... when they cover it you kind of just gloss over it. It’s a constant work-on, but the system would facilitate me being able to make reads if other stuff goes well. “I wouldn’t say mindset-wise but system-wise it’s different, so maybe the opportunities are presented. But I think the mindset is when you don’t have the ball you’ve got to be all-in. “It’s reflective of everything when we’re defending with Leinster and Ireland – and not overthink it. It’s just a place you’ve to get yourself to and stay there.”

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Companies That Partnered With Nvidia (NVDA) This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other stocks that partnered with NVIDIA this month. Nvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the rampant spending on AI infrastructure. The company’s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the most talked about technology in tech circles and that has catapulted the stock close to its all-time highs. For many, the stock continues to be an expensive bet and at current levels, it is hard to pull the trigger and invest in the company's stock. If you’re in the same boat and find it hard to buy a stock at its all-time highs, you may want to consider investing in companies that work with Nvidia. Nvidia’s accelerated computing technologies are powering many companies' products, especially those related to AI and autonomy. A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Uber, with the vast network of cars that already operate through its app, is one of the best stocks to benefit from autonomous vehicle technology. Uber sits on large amounts of data, gathered from the billions of trips completed on its network annually in over 70 countries. If Uber can feed this data to Large Language Models to train the future fleet of robotaxis, it won’t need to pay the drivers that operate on its network. It will also massively improve the efficiency of its operations. This is where Nvidia comes in. With Nvidia’s expertise in accelerated computing, the mobility company can reduce the time it will take to achieve autonomy. This is the exact sentiment that was echoed by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: By working with NVIDIA, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry Uber already collaborates with Waymo and Avride, but this partnership will boost the speed at which the company can achieve its autonomy objectives. Overall UBER ranks 7th on our list of the companies that partnered with NVIDIA this month. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Explore Coercion and Countermoves: The US-China Economic Rivalry Elizabeth Economy sits down with Melanie Hart to talk about Chinese economic coercion and US responses. In a wide-ranging conversation, Dr. Elizabeth Economy and Dr. Melanie Hart discuss China’s economic coercion, its impact globally, and how the United States can most effectively respond. Hart draws on cases from her time at the State Department to illustrate how her team successfully combatted Chinese efforts to use the power of their market to force political alignment by other countries. She also stresses, however, that this is an ongoing battle. Hart also describes the Biden administration's framework for reducing dependence on Chinese critical minerals and semiconductors. She underscores the importance of investing in domestic manufacturing, partnering with other countries to build alternatives to Chinese suppliers, and working with allies to coordinate effective policy and early warning systems to address supply chain issues before they occur. WATCH THE VIDEO >> Elizabeth Economy: Welcome to China Considered, a podcast that brings fresh insights and informed discussion to one of the most consequential issues of our time, how China is changing and changing the world. I'm Liz Economy, Hargrove Senior Fellow and Co-director of the U.S China and the World Program at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Today I have with me, Dr. Melanie Hart, who who just stepped down from her position as the Senior Advisor for China and the Indo Pacific in the Office of the Undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the environment at the U.S. department of State. And she's now the Senior Director for the Global China Hub at the Atlantic Council, Melanie, thank you so much for joining me today. >> Melanie Hart: Thanks for having me, Liz. >> Elizabeth Economy: So you were instrumental at the State Department in designing and driving forward a number of the agency's most consequential China initiatives, particularly around combating Chinese economic coercion. Can you start by just telling us a little bit about what is economic coercion? Why did you decide to focus on this particular issue at this particular time? As you know, it's been around for a long time, but I've never seen a U.S strategy to combat economic coercion, what made you take on this issue? >> Melanie Hart: Sure, so I joined the State Department in January 2021, when the Biden administration was coming in. It was the thick of when China was targeting Australia, Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID crisis, and Beijing hit them with a wide array of ridiculous trade measures, economic coercion. And as I was going around the department talking to the really great career diplomats saying, what should the Biden team focus on? Because the Biden team came in with our own priorities but a really important part of the process is going to the people who've been in the trenches and hearing from them where they think we should focus. Economic coercion just kept coming up again and again, there was a real desire across the department and across the interagency to find a way to do more than just be there diplomatically, to be there economically. And by happenstance, my boss, Under Secretary Jose Fernandez, was confirmed finally by the Senate in August of 2021 and that was the exact time that Beijing decided to go after Lithuania. And what Jose told us was, look, here we go let's use Lithuania as our test case. Their GDP is only 2% dependent on China, if we can't win this one, we all know we have a problem. Let's throw the toolkit, let's figure out what our toolkit is by digging around the interagency and finding every possible mechanism that we can use to directly support Lithuania. And I think that case was really the game changer on the one hand for other nations who had been targeted by China or were targeted by China afterwards. When they looked at Lithuania, they saw a model for how you can stand up for yourself. Not back down in the face of bullying and not just stand up, but actually turn it into a win for your own economy. Lithuania replaced all of the China trade that they lost with new partnerships in Asia. They started new embassies in Australia, South Korea and Singapore. They're laser exports to South Korea doubled so a lot of countries looked at that and said, hey, that's not a bad deal actually. And we were really shocked actually after the Lithuania case that other countries started knocking on the door and saying we want the Lithuania package, is that an option if Beijing gets mad at us too? So that was just really the game changer and that was I credit Lithuania for inspiring a lot of us for how we can really step in and succeed. >> Elizabeth Economy: So let me take you one step back and just ask. I mean when you look across the universe of Chinese economic coercion, is there a certain issue or set of issues that China tends to get particularly upset about and then tries to use the leverage of its market to change countries policies. What prompted for example, the Lithuania case? >> Melanie Hart: In Lithuania's case they were allowing Taiwan to open a local representative office and to use the name Taiwan in the title, that doesn't violate Europe's one China policy. But Beijing didn't like it but some people assume that this is a Taiwan thing, it's not. You see cases on commercial issues look at Australia that was because Australia called for an independent investigation of the COVID crisis with Canada. It was over Meng Wanzhou and that that detention issue, it really varies by case. We've seen them target Philippine bananas in the past over South China Sea. When you look at the empirical record, there is almost no issue that Beijing won't use as a trigger for economic coercion, so unfortunately there's really no safe space. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, I remember back when Daryl Morey, who was the general manager of the Houston Rockets for the NBA when he tweeted fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong. And then the Chinese began to target the NBA and have the all their gear removed from the shelves and particularly went off after the Houston Rockets, but also stopped televising the games in China. And I remember seeing on CCTV that it wasn't just you're exactly right it wasn't just about Taiwan or the South China Sea or what China called its core interests. What they said was any issue related right to sovereignty or social stability does not fall within the purview of free speech. And I think at that moment, just as you said, it's kind of like there's, there's no issue really around which China doesn't feel that it has the, the right to try to pressure other countries using their market to get them to align with Chinese interests. All right, so Lithuania became the case and what did you do in particular, what did the US do to support Lithuania? But beyond that, then how did you develop a kind of bigger strategy around countries that were being targeted for economic coercion? >> Melanie Hart: Sure, so the US rolled out a really innovative package to support Lithuania, which was all in direct response to what the Lithuanians were telling us China was targeting and where they need assistance. So for example, lasers are really critical for the Lithuanian economy their laser industry is a big source of pride and China had been buying them. As I just mentioned, their laser exports to South Korea have now doubled. But also the U.S. defense Department signed a bilateral procurement agreement with Lithuania that would allow them to sell lasers and other products to the US Military on equal footing with US companies. The US Military sees some value in a PRC free supply chain, also Lithuania had been in the pipeline to export eggs and other agricultural products to the United States. And the State Department helped them move through that process to get some those regulatory process moving and their ag exports to the US went up 19%, which is pretty significant. The US ex IM bank gave them a $600 million MOU to buy products from the United States they had previously been buying from China but China was blocking both exports and imports with Lithuania. And the great thing about that is Lithuania was telling us Beijing has canceled around 300 million in export credits that our companies were depending on. And US ex IM bank said we'll not just match that, but we'll double it and the important thing about that is the. Those are numbers. Those are real, concrete economic numbers. And the US can't replace China and anybody's supply chain, nor should that be our objective. That's not how markets work. But the US and other countries can help bridge the gap as companies are looking for and finding new opportunities. And to Lithuania's credit, their foreign minister and other members of their cabinet were all over the Asia Pacific making new friends, opening new embassies. And where they went diplomatically, commerce followed. And I think there was a great capstone on this Lithuania crisis turned into opportunity. In May of this year, the Lithuanian government held an economic coercion forum in Vilnius. Representatives from 30 different governments were there. The US was there at the vice ministerial level. Japan was there at the vice ministerial level. Costa Rica was there, the Koreans were there. 30 different countries sent representatives to Vilnius, which is a bit of a trek from the ROK or Costa Rica, to hear from Lithuania what their lessons learned were. And I think they are now seen as kind of a shining example that other countries are interested to follow and learn from. >> Elizabeth Economy: So do you think now that there's a kind of playbook that the United States, and its allies and partners have developed that can be deployed? Is this something that the EU and the US have come to some kind of here are the rules of the road. Is there a formalized mechanism in any way to address these kinds of cases? >> Melanie Hart: So in terms of formalized mechanism, I'll leave that to the current State Department colleagues to comment on what they have going on. But I will say, when you look at economic coercion cases, they are always different because every country's relationship with China is different. So for Australia, it was wine and barley and lobsters. For Lithuania, it was lasers and these other agricultural products and components. So every economic coercion case will involve different goods, with Canada, it was canola oil. So what we will really need to respond effectively is a broad coalition. And if shrimp is being targeted, the most important partners will be countries who have space to buy and eat more shrimp. >> Elizabeth Economy: I think this isn't necessarily something that you worked on when you were at the State Department, but I'm curious, was there discussion, consideration given to the targeting of just US companies? Because, again, there's been a long tradition in terms of China targeting our industries, whether it's the travel industry, the airline industry. I mentioned the case of the NBA. China frequently says, if you don't align with our government policy for example on Taiwan or the South China Sea, we are going to punish you, right? So are there lessons learned that you think are applicable for the United States in terms of supporting our companies that end up being targeted by the Chinese government, or they're sort of two separate things. >> Melanie Hart: This is a really tough one and timely given that Invidia was targeted this week, right? And I believe possibly intel as well. I mean, I'm of two minds about it. On the one hand, we always have to be honest with US Companies that China's a tough market, it's not a normal market economy. The risks are astronomical. And we don't want to see US Companies be dependent on the China market in such a way that when they are targeted. Because it's not, if it's a win when they are targeted, that that would have an outsized impact on their bottom line. But of course, at the same time, when China goes after US Companies, there should be a response. And I think the response to that should be based on what the companies are asking for, because it's the US Government's job to be a representative on behalf of the citizens that elect it. And that includes the companies that the US Government represents as well. Some companies might say, you know what, just let us work this one. Don't bring more heat to it, all you will do would bring heat. And I think that the US Government should listen to that. Other companies are going to say, that's it. We want the full package and they should get the full package. We should really defer to the companies who are deferring to their own workers, their employees, their shareholders. We should represent their interests, and that might vary case by case. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, fair point. And so the issue that you just raised, which is an issue of over dependence on China, particularly by companies. I think is another one that you worked on very directly at the State Department in terms of trying to educate. I think, US Companies and provide a framework for them globally to think about how to diversify their supply chains, how to develop more resilient supply chains. And for the US government, right for our basic needs, around things like critical minerals like semiconductors. Talk about that work, and was that something that was of special interest to you, or is that something that was kind of mandated from on high? What sort of effort did you personally undertake around this supply chain diversification issue, which has been, I think, a very central issue for the Biden administration. >> Melanie Hart: Yeah, so I'll focus on critical minerals and chips because they're different in terms of the mandate for critical minerals. I really credit my boss from the State Department, Undersecretary Jose Fernandez. When he came in, he looked at the critical mineral issue and recognized that our best advantage in competing with China when we go out and bid for mines and processing facilities to bring new supply to market is not cash. The US government doesn't have boatloads of cash to bankroll mines, unfortunately. But we do have allies and partners who all share the same interest in having access to supply that's not controlled by Beijing. Since Beijing has demonstrated they will all cut all of us off from that supply whenever they choose to make a point about something. So to his credit, Under Secretary Fernandez pulled a lot of experts together, and came up with a very innovative idea that he then got allied buy in for, which was the Mineral Security Partnership. The Mineral Security partnership brings together 14 US-allies, including the European Union, to jointly identify projects of interest and pull together companies from allied governments. Might be US, might not be US financing from allied governments and just get projects moving. Because from a US perspective, we don't necessarily have companies that are working in all of these mining sectors or in all of the processing sectors or that want to. But if Australia does and they bring new capacity online that supports US national security, and if the US brings something online, that's good for Australia as well, and that's been wildly successful. They announced two deals so far this year, one on germanium. A Belgian-based company teamed up with the DRC-based company to develop germanium in the DRC. And the other one's graphite, a graphite mine in Tanzania that's a joint project between a South Korean company or South Korea's Posco and Australia's blackrock Mining. Those are real deals that are coming to market with allies coming together. I think it's a tremendous success and something I I really hope to see the Trump administration continue because it's a winner, and I hope to see Congress put some money behind it. >> Elizabeth Economy: So you mentioned gallium or germanium and- Germanium and graphite. Germanium and graphite, which just happened to be two metals that the Chinese have put export controls on. Is that why in fact we pursued those projects? Or does this happen to be luck of the draw? >> Melanie Hart: So the US and China both look at the same trade data. So before China even started with the export controls, we were looking at the same trade data and seeing these are our vulnerabilities. So let's get moving now. China was looking at the same vulnerabilities and that's where they decided to hit us. But before they even went down that road, the US Was already working on alternative supply. >> Elizabeth Economy: So is the process then basically to look at those minerals and metals where we have the greatest dependence on China, or is it a function of our national security that we're most concerned about? How do we make the determination about where to go? >> Melanie Hart: It's both, so when the MSP started up, it focused specifically on the critical minerals for the energy transition. And it's expanded over time. On the other side, you mentioned semiconductors. In the chip sector, there are specific critical minerals that we need to make a semiconductor chip. So when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, which gave the State Department a $500 million fund to do both 5G security and semiconductor supply chain and semiconductor security, which is a lot for that amount of money. State immediately looked at that and said one of our priorities has to be going out and finding the critical minerals that are needed to make a chip and invest in capacity that's free from PRC control. Because we cannot allow there to be a situation where your colleagues at Commerce, Liz, are doing such a great job bringing new fabs online here in the United States. We cannot have a situation where those fabs have to go get on their knees and beg Beijing for the gallium and their germanium that they need to make a semiconductor chip. So recognizing that there is a need for specific chip for specific minerals where China had a stranglehold on global supply, State had a specific effort under the CHIPS Act focused on semiconductors. >> Elizabeth Economy: And the semiconductor effort was broader, too, right? There was more, there was educational component. I mean, I think State Department really created, along with European and Asian allies, a pretty full bore program for investment and training in some emerging and middle income economies. Can you talk a little bit about that work? >> Melanie Hart: Yeah, absolutely, so the semiconductor side of the State Department CHIPS Act program focuses on three big priorities. The first is the one that I mentioned. Well, and all of these priorities nest under one big objective, which is provide the domestic US fabs with the international environment they need to succeed. So the international effort is in service of the domestic effort and domestic US jobs. It has three parts, one, get the critical minerals needed to make a chip, make sure we have access to supply that the PRC can't cut off. Two, work with allies and partners to get to a degree of coordination on policy, particularly subsidy policy. You don't wanna see a situation where Commerce Department here in the US, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Koreans are all trying to subsidize the same companies to come and build fabs. And we're pricing each other out of the market by having to bid and compete with one another. So we wanted to do what we could to align subsidy policy among nations. And that required having some kind of early warning system so that Europe could be dependent on chips from the United States and have early warning if a shortage is is likely or a supply gut and the same supply glut. And the same thing from the United States with Europe and Japan, and Korea. We can be more confident with some friends shoring if we have good transparency and information on those supply chains. So that was the policy pillar with allies. And then the third and final piece was when chips come off the factory line in Arizona and Texas, the fabs being built in the United States. The model is you do a lot of the processing, the downstream processing, the test testing, packaging, assembly, getting it ready to plug into your iPhone or to your laptop. A lot of that happens in middle income countries. That keeps cost lower for the fabs here and keeps the higher income jobs in the United States. And that capacity was concentrated in a few places, Malaysia, particularly during COVID when Malaysia had COVID, outbreaks, you couldn't make a car in the United States because the chip supply line ground to a halt. So that third piece of the chip strategy was identifying some clusters of nations that were ripe to either expand their downstream processing capacity or become a downstream processor. And state selected a group in the Americas and a group in Asia. And the group in the Americas was Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama. And in Asia it was the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India. And it was shocking to see how powerful it was to give those nations a ticket to enter into a US-centric supply chain as sparkly and exciting as one rooted in the CHIPS Act as an alternative to the lower value-added China supply chain. And the way the program works is it's not suitcases full of cash. It's not the Beijing model. State deployed the OECD to go into these countries and do a deep assessment of why isn't TSMC building a plant right now. Why isn't Intel building a plant right now and get a punch list of the things that needed to be done to move them up and make that market more attractive? As you said, a big need was workforce development. So State funded Arizona State University to go in and train workers to work in some of these facilities. And the reception has been tremendous. The most exciting thing at State was about a year after rolling out this program, we started being deluged by other countries that would say, I want to be the next Costa Rica, or I want what the Philippines has. And so we created something that had been missing, which is this pull factor, kind of a the pull of an opportunity that countries wanted to opt into. So we weren't just going around saying, China, bad move away from China. We had something to offer. >> Elizabeth Economy: No, that's exciting. Of course, at a certain point, I guess that $400 million that State Department got to do this kind of work also runs out. Is there still money left to be deployed or are we kind of at the end of the sort of the gravy train, or is it being picked up in different ways by private institutions, universities and companies that can keep moving it forward? What's the sort of sustainability of this program? >> Melanie Hart: So State and Commerce had different rules from Congress. You guys had it easy, I think Commerce, they just gave you 52 billion and you could run from there. >> Elizabeth Economy: 39 billion, because the science part never got funded, but yes, okay. >> Melanie Hart: 39 billion is a lot at state was 100 million year for five years. And every year, Congress would approve the next year's budget, and they would one by one approve each of the countries and activities that we would want to partner with. The great thing about that is that Congress was deeply supportive and wonderful to work with. The Republicans were as supportive as the Dems on SFRC when we would do our briefings. So they got it because they had written the CHIPS Act. So they got what we were trying to do, they were deeply supportive. They have been with the State Department every step of the way, so I have pretty high confidence that that would not change going into the new administration. I think what Congress should do is give State more money, because if you actually care about 5G security and rewiring the entire global semiconductor supply chain, $100 million a year to do both is a bit sad. I think we can do better, I think given that this is something the US has never done before, it makes sense to start out where they started out and not overload the finances in the beginning. But at this point, the success speaks for itself and there is clearly room and need to ramp up. And I think in particular, that critical mineral piece would be a great way, a great place to build in more funding, because now that the program has moved from identifying where the minerals are and where we should invest. To doing some, being ready to do some of those investments, there's a lot of space and they can, for example, maybe a lot of that money can flow through DFC, who can go in and finance some deals in some of these places. But, you know, I mean, the question I always ask Congress is, do you want the US Fabs to have to get on their knees and beg Beijing for some for critical minerals or not, it's really their decision? >> Elizabeth Economy: Right, I mean, and I think because it so directly serves our national interest and because the Chinese have developed a retaliatory toolkit now that directly targets these kinds of critical minerals and metals. I think maybe Congress will be more receptive to more funding for the DFC and for these kinds of investments moving forward. So, I think the major theme and not surprisingly, since you were at the State Department of your work and of your comments today, has been on the partnership with our allies. You've talked a lot about what I think have been amazing successes that you've had in the work that you've done. Have there been any, if not failures, let's say, any efforts that maybe didn't come fully to fruition things that the U.S tried to pursue with our allies and partners, but just somehow didn't get the kind of pickup that you would have liked to have seen? >> Melanie Hart: Well, let me say this, it is no accident that I have come to the Atlantic Council to do China work here. I think we have a lot of work to do in the transatlantic partnership and approaching the China challenge together. It was pretty frustrating to watch the dynamic play out when Europe was assessing making the decisions about tariffs on PRC EVs. The US tariffed PRC EVs at 100%, Canada did the same thing, Brazil has tariffs on PRC EVs, Turkey has tariffs on PRC EVs and the German Chancellor, German autos, more than any other stand to lose by China's predatory market tactics in the EV sector. And Germany voted against any kind of tariffs on Chinese EVs that really, to me tells us that we have more work to do there. And we have great as you know, there are really amazing China experts across Europe and America and elsewhere. So what I'm most excited about leaving the US Government is coming to the Atlantic Council, which has a transatlantic focus and doing China work here. We're looking at standing up some really interesting things on the de-risking front, at digging in on what US de-risking should look like going forward and trying to find the Venn diagram of where that overlaps with Europe, where that overlaps with Latin America and other partners. And I understand that Europe has a different system it's not one country, it's a group of countries that have to work together and the Commission has trade policy and the capitals have foreign policy and that's complicated, but we have to get it right. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, no, I think that's a really good point and I know we both met with the same European delegation recently. And I think one of the things that I spoke with them about is, is how, you know, the U.S government, and certainly at the Commerce Department, but I think also at the State Department, how we worked to educate US business about the risks inherent in being too dependent on a China market. And that this really did have, I think, a pretty profound impact, I think business really did move up pretty aggressively. A lot of business on a learning curve when it comes to this, the idea of de-risking and so I think your work to educate more, I think will be very welcomed and as you say, I think probably pretty necessary. So let me ask you one last touch to touch on one last area, which is Taiwan, because you also worked on the sort of US Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership dialogue. Everything you did had a big, like, mouthful of words, I have to say but Taiwan obviously is a really was a very important part of US Strategy over the past four years and talk a little bit about what this was and what came out of it. >> Melanie Hart: So a lot of the State Department programs do have really long names and so they all have acronyms. So we call the Taiwan dialogue the EPPD, look Taiwan is our seventh largest trading partner, our tenth largest export market and our, the sixth largest market for U.S. food and agricultural products, that's huge. So it's natural that the US should have economic mechanisms for talking to Taiwan, commerce has a semiconductor supply chain dialogue with them. USTR has a trade more than dialogue now, 21st century trade process with them and State I think about the State Department's EPPD as the US Taiwan Dialogue, where economics meets foreign policy. It's kind of the economic security, economic statecraft dialogue with Taiwan and State. Under Secretary Fernandez and the team just had the fifth EPPD with Taiwan in October and they shared the list of things that they covered. It's economic coercion, working together to do infrastructure investments jointly in third countries it is addressing bilateral taxation. I know Secretary Raimondo was really focused on that, we were encouraging TSMC to come here into the United States and invest and that the taxation burden is real there. So supply chains, all kinds of things, I mean it's a, it's a great, it's a great dialogue for figuring out how to align on the economic security side of the coin. >> Elizabeth Economy: Okay, great, if only we could have productive dialogues these days with the PRC as well but I guess that's gonna have to wait for some point in, in the future. Okay, so lightning round, let me just ask you a couple of quick final questions. What's your must read booker article on China? >> Melanie Hart: So this is a little bit out of the box, but the book that I've read over the past year that has stuck with me the most and really helped me put some of what I see with China in a broader context. Is a book by a historian, Calder Walton's book called Spies, Epic Intelligence War between East and West. And it is a fabulous detailed history of how Russia approached the West before, during, and after the Cold War. And it has great source material, but really shows how the Soviets and then the Russians always perceive themselves as being weaker than the West economically weaker, weaker military. They didn't have the tech edge, and so they felt that espionage, coercion, subversion, everything was on the table to catch up and to even the playing field. And in their eyes, that was just the legitimate way to do business. I see some really big parallels with China, both in the way so many Chinese counterparts over the years, when you are talking to friends and counterparts in Beijing, you can kinda tell what's total talking points and what. When they keep saying it for ten years, even after drinks and late at night, you figure this one might be real. And one thing that always stuck out to me is a lot of people I deeply respect and admire and like talking to in China, they just can't conceive of what our problem is. Given that we're always stronger than them, of course they're going to use these other tactics. And I felt that this put that in context in a way that nothing else has. And in terms of articles, there was one article that I kept on my desk at the State Department and my colleague Jonathan Fritz did as well, and that's Xi Jinping's November 2020 article in Qiushi where he just says blatantly, our aim is to make international supply chains dependent on China. We kept that there as a reminder of what our job was. >> Elizabeth Economy: That is a particularly, I think, telling quotation. It's good that he's always basically signaling exactly what he plans to do and what he sees his mission as being. I think it helps us a lot. Okay, what do you miss most and least about your time in government? >> Melanie Hart: I had a unique opportunity because the things I was working on, there was no playbook. After 911, the US built up a whole counterterror apparatus and reoriented the government for counterterror operations. I see the Biden administration as a time when we were reorienting the government for economic statecraft and figuring out how to operate in this post COVID economic security space. And working for Under Secretary Fernandez, he would just say, achieve the objective don't let bureaucracy stop you. And Secretary Blinken would just say, lean in. And so our message was lean in. Don't ask permission, just get things done. And working with the amazing career diplomats at state in those trenches, and my diplomatic partners from allies and partner countries as well, where nobody has a rule book, we all have kind of a green light from our leadership to work together and figure things out. That was a, I think, tremendous opportunity and space for innovation. And I'm just deeply humbled by the brilliance that I saw in my career colleagues and what they can do when you give them the space to do that. And in terms of what I miss least, man, it's great being back on the think tank side and just saying, just speaking for myself and being really direct. When you're speaking for a government, it's different, as you know. So being China experts who say what we think without the weight or the carefulness of a broader entity behind us is a lot of fun. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, I'm not sure I ever mastered the ability to just say what the government was telling me to say, but I tried. Okay, quickly, what one thing do you wish that the administration had done differently with regard to China? >> Melanie Hart: This won't be a shock to you, but trade deals with other countries. That's the missing piece of our toolkit. We've done a lot, but that's the missing piece. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yes, US no trade representative. Yep, anyway. Okay, quickly, what China issue do we not know enough about? >> Melanie Hart: That's a great question. I don't know if you had the same experience, but for me, this was my first government job. And being on the inside and getting that deep understanding of how the US policy process works really drove home to me how much I don't know about the inner workings of China's policy process. Is there an interagency policy committee? If there is one, to what degree is it real? Does Xi Jinping see different ideas or are they filtered before he gets to them? To what degree is there still bottom up versus top down? I think a great thing about the US system is there is a lot of space for bottom up innovation. I mean, how great was it to have Secretary Blinken say, lean in? And the Under Secretary say, just don't let bureaucracy stop you. I don't think that's what they're getting in Beijing for sure. But we don't know enough about what's really going on inside that policy process. And I really wish we did. >> Elizabeth Economy: Okay, last one. On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely, and I think I already know the answer to this one. How likely do you think we are to see a breakthrough in US China relations over the next decade? >> Melanie Hart: Unfortunately, I'd say around zero. There could be something short term. President Trump has mentioned that he's had communication with Xi Jinping. A lot of the folks going into the Trump administration are talking about trying to do a deal that Trump's tariff threats are to gain leverage so that they can do some kind of deal with China. Unfortunately, there's nothing that Xi Jinping is willing to give the United States in any deal that's in US national interests. That's unfortunate. So there could be short term blips, but I think it'll be a while before there's anything real. >> Elizabeth Economy: Okay, well, on that note, let me thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. As always, Melanie, you are both incredibly articulate and thoughtful and very much to the point. So thanks again. >> Melanie Hart: Great, thanks for having me, Liz. >> Elizabeth Economy: If you enjoyed this podcast and want to hear more reasoned discourse and debate on China, I encourage you to subscribe to China Considered via the Hoover Institution YouTube channel or podcast platform of your choice.

Title: The Protocol: Hyperliquid Responds to Decentralization Criticism

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Features and Opinion Editor. In this issue: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. HYPERLIQUID CRITICISM: HyperLiquid, a major up-and-comer in the world of decentralized finance, came under fire this week over claims that the network is overly centralized and difficult to work with. HyperLiquid is best known for its flagship decentralized exchange and it recently launched a layer-1 blockchain — all bids by the startup to, according to its flashy web copy, eventually "house all finance." Despite earning plaudits for its fast and easy-to-use exchange interface, HyperLiquid has been criticized for, among other things, operating a closed-source codebase. According to a widely-shared X thread from Kam Benbrik, an employee at the validator firm Chorus One, the validators powering HyperLiquid are mostly blind to how the chain works under the hood, making it difficult for them to operate the hardware that's supposed to run the chain. Benbrik also raised concerns that HyperLiquid's highly concentrated token supply — and its process for admitting validators to its L1 chain — make the chain centralized and vulnerable to failures. "Hyperliquid must improve transparency, decentralize staking, implement a fair validator selection process, and engage more with external validators," Benbrik wrote. The complaints come on the heels of a flurry of positive media attention for HyperLiquid following November's massively successful HYPE airdrop. It hasn't all been smooth sailing for the startup, however, with scrutiny arising in December following reports of potential North Korean activity on the network — interpreted by some as a sign that the regime well-known for its crypto-hacking efforts might have HyperLiquid in its crosshairs. HyperLiquid has batted away the North Korean security concerns, and it recently addressed the centralization and closed-source critiques in an X thread, stating that the criticisms largely stemmed from "misconceptions" about its tech.

"Firedancer's proponents believe the software – developed by the crypto arm of trading giant Jump – will give Solana an unbeatable edge in crypto's race to woo global financial markets onto blockchains," writes CoinDesk's Danny Nelson. "They point to its theoretical speed: one million transactions per second, orders of magnitude faster than any blockchain-based system today." --Sam Kessler STARKWARE APPCHAINS: Starknet, the layer-2 blockchain on Ethereum known for its embrace of zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, is adding appchains. StarkWare, the primary developer of Starknet, told CoinDesk that its "SN Stack" will let developers easily build blockchains tailored to specific crypto use cases. Read more ARBITRUM-a-LOTTE: Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 network on Ethereum, plans to deepen ties with Lotte Group, the multibillion-dollar South Korean conglomerate known for its vast portfolio of shopping malls, media companies and entertainment properties. Offchain Labs, the developer behind Arbitrum, and the Arbitrum Foundation, the non-profit that stewards the project's development, said a financial deal is in the works that would cement Arbitrum as the main blockchain infrastructure provider for "Caliverse," Lotte's metaverse gaming platform. Read more AVALANCHE UPGRADE: Avalanche, now the tenth-largest L1 by total value locked (TVL), activated its highly anticipated Avalanche9000 upgrade, marking its biggest technical changes since launch in 2020. The network has been prepping these changes for months, with new features that will cut the costs for sending transactions, operating validators and building applications on the network. Leaders at Avalanche said the upgrade is meant to attract developers, encouraging them to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets, or “L1s." Read more. DO KWON TRIAL: Terraform Labs co-founder and former CEO Do Kwon’s criminal fraud trial in the U.S. has been tentatively scheduled for January 2026, allowing prosecutors and Kwon’s defense attorneys time to review the “massive” six-terabyte trove of data expected to be produced during the discovery process. During an initial hearing in Manhattan this week, lead prosecutor Jared Lenow told the court that the government expected to face additional delays due to challenges accessing encrypted information and unlocking four cell phones provided by Montenegrin authorities when they extradited Kwon to the U.S. on Dec. 31st. Lenow added that the government must also translate extracted material from Kwon’s native Korean. Read more. PYTH PARTNERS: Blockchain oracle firm Pyth Network has partnered with neobank Revolut to port digital banking data into decentralized finance. Revolut will provide data for more than 500 markets including foreign exchange, equities and commodities. Revolut also runs a crypto exchange although volume data is not published. Pyth competes with ChainLink and aims to provide accurate price feeds for DeFi protocols. It airdropped its native token (PYTH) in 2023 and has $7.5 billion in value secured on its oracle, according to DefiLlama. Pyth also receives data from crypto exchanges Bitstamp, Bybit and Binance as well as several trading firms such as Jane Street and Cumberland DRW. Read more. AI COINS: AI-crypto tokens are failing to live up to their lofty 2024 goals despite Nvidia's (NVDA) recent conference sparking bullish sentiment among AI stocks in the traditional markets. Last March, the NEAR token doubled in the lead-up to Nvidia's annual conference, gains that were mirrored across the wider crypto AI market. Fetch.AI (FET), the graph (GRT) and singularityNET (AGIX) all posted significant rallies to the upside in unison with the conference. Why are AI tokens losing momentum? One reason: the emergence of AI agent tokens. Read more.

Title: AST SpaceMobile's Large Satellites to Roll and Tilt to Prevent Astronomy Interference

AST SpaceMobile is highlighting how it will ensure that its large satellites do not become a nuisance to astronomers through several changes, including rolling and tilting in space. Last week, the cellular satellite provider sent a letter to the FCC about its efforts to prevent the company's BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. These satellites each boast an exceptionally large 700-square-foot panel, which can reflect sunlight, turning the satellites into some of the most luminous objects in the sky, akin to a bright star. In the letter to the FCC, AST says it’s close to reaching a “comprehensive coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation for both optical astronomy and radio astronomy. “The parties are in the final stages of approving the agreement,” Texas-based AST SpaceMobile writes. The document adds that AST has committed to taking several measures, which include “using commercially reasonable efforts to operationally roll or tilt spacecraft to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes.” Another measure involves the satellites incorporating “deployable antenna elements that reduce brightness.” The company has also pledged to share its satellite location data with astronomers, giving them a way to plan their observations ahead of time. “AST SpaceMobile will also continue to evaluate ways to mitigate impacts on optical astronomy interests, including physical design changes, attitude maneuvering, maintaining authorized orbital elevations, and providing orbital information to astronomers,” the letter adds. AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, NSF said it's "in the process of coordinating with AST SpaceMobile [and will] share more information when coordination is complete." So it’s unclear how AST plans to roll and tilt its satellites, and what other design changes may be in store. But the FCC made the NSF coordination a condition to granting partial approval to AST operating its satellite constellation. The startup envisions one day operating dozens of BlueBird satellites in orbit, capable of beaming internet data to phones on the ground. But astronomers have been worrying about the brightness of the company’s satellites, especially since they could proliferate and disrupt telescopic observations. In the meantime, AST’s first batch of BlueBird satellites were sent into Earth’s orbit in September. Over a month later, all five satellites unfolded their antenna arrays.

Title: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): Jim Cramer Bets on a Breakout 2024 for This “Cult Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other NASDAQ 100 stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his perspective on the stock market, especially reflecting on the events of 2024. He emphasized that years like 2024 don’t come around often, where everything feels so clear and the winners are so apparent. According to Cramer, if investors tried to get too creative or overcomplicate their strategies, they likely missed out on the obvious winners. “If you tried to get creative, you tried to get clever, you missed out on some truly idiot-proof winners. The losers on the other hand, well, they were not as easy to spot because in many cases they were the market’s former winners, even if they long ago lost their way.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 10 SaaS Stocks As part of his annual analysis on Mad Money, Cramer examined the top and bottom performers of the Nasdaq 100 in 2024, offering insights into what worked and what didn’t. He reviewed how, in many instances, investors tend to become frustrated with stocks that are overhyped, knowing deep down that eventually, something better will come along. He likened these overly loved stocks to a “mouse trap,” where the price could only go down from such lofty heights, warning that many investors would regret not jumping off the metaphorical spaceship before the crash. Cramer shared his thoughts on the five best performers in the NASDAQ 100 for 2024, calling it a “real good collection of winners” and expressing a genuine fondness for these stocks. He also noted that, while the Nasdaq 100 losers may have appeared to have suffered dramatic declines, the reality was more nuanced. “The Nasdaq 100 losers, though they aren’t so horrible as the declines would make you think, but they got clobbered because they were emblematic of golden calves, worshipped for a long time before being revealed as not so special after all.” For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 While Cramer has previously called Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) a “cult stock”, more recently, he has been highlighting the rapid growth of the company and its numerous government projects. In the recent episode of Mad Money, calling the stock a winner in 2024, he commented: “Most obvious winner for 2024, Palantir, the defense software company trying to revolutionize the way the Pentagon works. Its CEO Alex Karp is a brilliant bad boy Smash Mouth Philly guy who’s like a meaner version of Elon Musk and probably threw snowballs if not batteries at Santa Claus from the lower level of the link. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a software company that focuses on developing advanced data platforms, primarily serving government agencies with tools designed for data analysis and decision-making. The company has become well known for its ability to assist in large-scale data operations, often providing solutions to complex government challenges. In a recent interview, Palantir CEO, Alex Karp stressed the need for tech-government collaboration, especially regarding the AI arms race, and expressed optimism about the incoming administration’s potential to tackle government challenges. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has highlighted an opportunity for Palantir to address inefficiencies within the U.S. government, particularly within the Washington, D.C. area. Ives believes that the company could capitalize on these inefficiencies to make significant progress in its operations. In addition, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been involved in the formation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aims to streamline government operations.

Title: The full list of major US companies slashing staff in the new year, including Microsoft, Blackrock, and Ally

Layoffs and other workforce reductions are continuing in 2025, following two years of significant job cuts across tech, media, finance, manufacturing, and retail. While companies' reasons for slimming their staff vary, the cost-cutting measures are coming amid a backdrop of technological change. In a recent World Economic Forum survey, some 41% of companies worldwide said they were expecting to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Companies such as Dropbox, Google, and IBM have previously announced job cuts related to AI. Tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are meanwhile expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. Here are the companies with job cuts planned or already underway in 2025 so far. BlackRock told employees it was planning to cut about 200 people of its 21,000-strong workforce, according to Bloomberg. The reductions are more than offset by some 3,750 workers who were added last year and another 2,000 expected to be added in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said the cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg reported. Bridgewater Associates cut 7% of its staff on Monday in an effort to stay lean, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. The layoffs at the world's largest hedge fund bring its head count back to where it was in 2023, the person said. The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said in a 2019 interview that about 30% of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. The Washington Post is eliminating less than 100 employees in an effort to cut costs, Reuters reported Tuesday. A spokesperson told the wire service that the changes would occur across multiple areas of the business and indicated that the cuts wouldn't affect the newsroom. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are," the spokesperson said, according to Reuters. Microsoft is planning job cuts soon, and the company is taking a harder look at underperforming employees as part of the reductions, according to two people familiar with the plans. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed cuts but declined to share details on the number of employees being let go. "At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent," the spokesperson said. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action." The digital-financial-services company Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. The impacted employees were notified on Tuesday. "As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas, while continuing to hire in our other areas of our business," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the company was offering severance, out-placement support, and the opportunity to apply for openings at Ally. Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, the Charlotte Observer reported. If you're an employee with a tip about coming job cuts, please contact Dominick via email or text/call/Signal at 646.768.4750. Responses will be kept confidential, and Business Insider strongly recommends using a personal email and a non-work device when reaching out. Jump to

Title: After Nvidia CEO's quantum computing forecast, strategist says 'good luck' to investors
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ceo-quantum-computing-forecast-good-luck-investo-1851735570
Time Published: 2025-01-08T21:07:00Z
Full Content:
Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (IBKR), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said today that quantum computing might be a couple of decades away, or at least its usefulness. How do you see that affecting AI stocks and Nvidia (NVDA) stock? STEVE SOSNICK (SS): The one thing about quantum computing is really people hadn’t been thinking about it until, call it a month ago, six weeks ago, when Alphabet announced that they were closer to some sort of quantum computing breakthrough, but even at the time, they didn’t say it was immediate breakthrough. They implied that it was years away, seven years, a decade, et cetera. Yet, the quantum computing stocks went crazy. Number three stock on the Interactive Brokers platform for the last couple of weeks has been Rigetti Computing (RGTI), RGTI. I doubt many viewers heard of this stock two months ago. But here it is. But people love a good story. People love small stocks that move and this thing went up multiple times in a fairly short period of time. They’re all down about 40 or 50% today, RGTI, IONQ (IONQ), QUBT (QUBT), et cetera, all these are small companies. And interestingly Alphabet (GOOGL) was not one of the most actively traded stocks in our platform for a while, which tells you something. It tells you that people wanted the sexy new thing rather than the company that actually might have been closest to commercializing it anyway. When Jensen Huang speaks, the market listens. And we learned that Monday night, we learned that with the stock, with Nvidia running up 10% into Jensen’s CES address. And I did write at the time that it seemed like an inevitable buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news event. It was because Nvidia rallied 10%, as did Tesla (TSLA), by the way, 10% in two days. On a company that size, that’s $370 billion in market cap, what could he say that was worth more than the $370 billion that was priced in? So going back to the comments today about quantum computing, I think AI remains a thing with or without quantum computing. That would obviously be helpful somewhere down the road because AI requires immense computing power. If quantum computing can do it more efficiently and effectively, that would be good for the AI theme. But I don’t think that was really priced in recently. It certainly hadn’t been until six weeks ago. So I think AI remains what it is. Quantum computing remains, let’s say, this big, bright, shiny object way off in the future, and we were reminded of it. That’s what Google told us when the craze got started and Jensen Huang just reminded us of that today, and it’s an unpleasant reminder for those who’d been speculating in those stocks. AM: I was wondering if it would be a buying opportunity right now to get into these smaller AI stocks that are getting beaten today. But Jensen was pretty clear about the timeline of quantum computing. What would you do if you were an investor? SS: That’s reasonably fair. I think these [quantum computing] stocks got well ahead of themselves. Again, we’re talking about the way to think of these stocks is a lot like biotechs. Nvidia and Alphabet, all these other companies, they’re the Merck (MRK), the Lilly (LLY), the Pfizer (PFE), except for the fact that they are growing a lot faster. Well, maybe with the exception of Lilly because of the diet drugs. But these are the companies that are the established companies with the established growth. And you could think of some of these other companies like biotechs where there’s largely a crapshoot. They’re either going to discover this breakthrough and commercialize it, or they’re gonna get close to it, and they’re gonna get bought by one of these bigger companies. But what we’re talking about here is years away. I’m far from being an expert to tell you which of these companies might be closest to commercializing them. I will take the Alphabets and Nvidias of the world telling me that we’re not close on some of them. I think from a trading point of view, sure, it’s logical to look at them down 40, 50% and say, maybe it’s time to buy the dip. From an investing point of view, I don’t know what they’re really worth. So, thinking from a fundamental point of view, good luck. I don’t know. AM: Nvidia stock saw that huge run-up going into CES, and then there was the pullback on Tuesday. What do you see next for Nvidia stock? SS: Nvidia’s tricky because it’s hard to say that it can be an overlooked value play. It’s literally the most talked about, most watched, most important company in the marketplace right now. It may not be number one in terms of market cap, but it’s in spitting distance. So there’s not a lot of hidden information when it comes to Nvidia. It’s gonna be about their ability to deliver. Jensen Huang showed some interesting gadgetry at CES, but again, it had been more than priced in by the stock’s move and investors or traders, I should say, are very big on chasing rallies, on buying momentum. You know, it’s always been about “buy low, sell high”, but I think right now you’ve also got a fair degree of “it’s moving so let’s buy high and hope to sell higher. Let’s buy into these rallies.” We’re seeing them get stretched. Those are the things I would avoid or at least if you are going to participate in them, realize that you are doing this as a trade, not as an investment. I’m never going to dissuade someone from trading (That’s what I’ve spent most of my career doing), but it’s very important to distinguish between the two. So I think with Nvidia, listen to the analysts, listen to the market, and take opportunities, but don’t necessarily chase stock. This is one where I think it’s become much more of a fundamental play despite the fact that it has these occasional trading movements.

Shares in MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) dropped by 7.20 percent or $1.48 on Tuesday to close at $19.07 apiece as investors resorted to profit-taking following Monday’s gains and news that it loaned 7,377 of its Bitcoin holdings. Investors took the news as a potential risk to the company’s portfolio, especially as it represents as much as 16.4 percent of its reserves. According to the company, the move to loan to third parties was to help generate additional income. “There has been significant interest in MARA’s bitcoin lending program,” said MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) vice president for investor relations Robert Samuels on X. “It focuses on short-term arrangements with well-established third parties. It generates a modest single-digit yield. It has been active throughout 2024. The long-term objective is to generate sufficient yield to offset operating expenses.” Overall, MARA ranks 10th on our list of firms mirroring Wall Street decline. While we acknowledge the potential of MARA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Congressional Democrats appeared to greatly enhance their wealth in 2024, despite only earning a yearly salary of $174,000. Democrat stock portfolios in 2024 far outpaced the S&P 500, a study by Unusual Whales found Tuesday, spiking on average 31 percent, seven points higher than the S&P 500 (24 percent) and five points higher than Republican colleagues (26 percent). Unusual Whales estimated each member’s stock portfolio performance by calculating the value of each stock from the beginning of 2024 to the end of 2024. The biggest Democrat offender was Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), whose portfolio spiked 142 percent, the report found: Wasserman Schultz was not the only Democrat deploying an aggressive investment strategy.

However most of Congress tracked SPY (20-27% returns), with less active trading than previous years. What’s more, those who outperformed SPY really outperformed the S&P, including in the options world (Nancy Pelosi specifically) Why? Well, because Congress often held big tech, the winners of this cycle. Holding Amazon, NVDA, META, and more boosted Congress’ returns this year. Let’s not forget that many of these big tech companies also lobby the very same people that hold company shares. Our politicians may have direct oversight over policy decisions that could financially help or hurt these companies. Congressional stock trading is an issue that unites most Americans. Eighty-six percent of Americans, including 87 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats, and 81 percent of independents, support barring members of Congress and their families from trading stocks, a poll found in 2023.

Deutsche Bank cut its rating on PANW to Hold from Buy. Additionally, Deutsche reduced its price target on the shares to $190 from $207. 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors Warning that IT security companies will have a difficult time in 2025, Deutsche believes that Palo Alto will have trouble continuing to grow at a 15% clip going forward. Additionally, the company's 2025 performance is likely already baked into the shares, Deutsche contended. Meanwhile, Flutter, the owner of the popular sports betting app FanDuel, lowered its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance yesterday after the market closed. According to Schwab, the company reduced its full-year sales outlook because its customers "were winning too much." "The 2024-2025 NFL season to date has been the most customer-friendly since the launch of online sports betting, with the highest rate of favorites winning in nearly 20 years," Schwab quoted Flutter as saying. Flutter reduced the midpoint of its full-year revenue guidance range by about $370 million to roughly $5.78 billion. Additionally, it lowered the midpoint of its 2024 U.S. adjusted EBITDA guidance range by about $205 million to roughly $505 million. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Nvidia's CEO says 'useful' quantum computers are decades away — and the stocks tank

Nvidia (NVDA-3.12%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t think useful quantum computers will be here anytime soon — and stocks are not reacting well to it. Quantum computing stocks such as IonQ (IONQ+5.02%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-11.45%) fell by more than 40% Wednesday morning after Huang’s comments during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). IonQ’s shares were down by about 45%, while Rigetti’s shares fell by more than 48% mid-morning. Quantum Computing (QUBT-10.95%), which announced a stock offering earlier this week to raise $100 million, saw its shares fall by about 49%. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-4.51%), meanwhile, saw shares fall by around 47%. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” The Nvidia chief said he thinks the AI chipmaker will play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” In December, Google (GOOGL-0.80%) stock climbed more than 4% after it unveiled its latest quantum chip, Willow. Google Quantum AI announced that its state-of-the-art quantum chip demonstrated “two major achievements” in quantum computing, including “exponentially” reducing the rate of errors when adding more qubits — a challenge that has existed for almost 30 years. “Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing,” said Hartmut Neven, founder and lead of Google Quantum AI, because they “have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult to protect the information needed to complete a computation.” Huang announced a suite of artificial intelligence tools for AI agents and updates to the chipmaker’s robotics efforts at the annual CES Las Vegas trade show on Monday night.

Title: 2025 China Outlook: A Recipe For Re-Rating

Re-Rating Executive Summary The unprecedented stimulus announced by China’s government was a significant catalyst for China’s equity market broadly in the second half of 2024. Stimulus measures in 2024 included: In 2024, the KraneShares MSCI All China Index ETF (Ticker: KALL) returned 16.33%, the KraneShares MSCI China A 50 Connect Index ETF (Ticker: KBA) returned 16.06%, and the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (Ticker: KWEB) returned 13.25%.1 2024 Performance For KALL, KWEB, and KBA standard performance, risks, and top 10 holdings, please visit kraneshares.com/kall, kraneshares.com/kweb, or kraneshares.com/kba. Introduction Ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky famously stated, “I skate to where the puck is going and not to where it has been.” After fifteen years of outperformance, it is understandable that global investors have become solely focused on a single asset class: US equities. But, are they lingering too long on where the puck has been? If China equity allocations or non-US equity allocations more broadly, represent where the puck is going, current positioning does not reflect that. Allocations range from underweight to non-existent, to the extreme “un-investable” bucket. This is despite China’s significant role in the global economy and its importance to the bottom lines of both US and global multinationals. Extreme declarations such as “uninvestable,” against the backdrop of light positioning and low valuations, have historically been the hallmark indicators of an asset class' bottom. However, as the saying goes, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” The reality is that the most widely held US stocks have significant China revenue, but little to no beta to the negative media narrative that continues to weigh on China equities and general investor sentiment toward China. Several changes in the tone and tenor of government officials caught our attention in the first half of the year. However, it was not until after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, finally fired the proverbial fiscal policy “bazooka” on Tuesday, September 24th, that global investors recognized the change in trajectory. Notably, the release from the CPC Central Committee in December used the phrase “moderately loose” to describe monetary policy, refraining from using the word “stable” for the first time since 2011. Reasonably, scar tissue from internet regulation, the zero COVID policy, and geopolitical flare-ups kept many investors skeptical and on the sidelines of the resulting massive rally in China’s equity market. In this outlook, we will explore the potential trajectory of China’s economic policy and equity market in 2025, why we think measures from 2024 will not be felt until later in 2025, important structural reforms that could begin this year, and global investors’ potential path to reallocation. 2024 Stimulus: More Than a Short-Term Bounce China’s government has ample dry powder after providing minimal stimulus during the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, when economic challenges persisted, China continued this fiscal conservatism. As such, China’s overall government debt remains low at 62% of gross domestic product (GDP), with most of the debt coming from local governments. 2024’s stimulus is just a drop in the bucket in terms of China’s borrowing capacity before reaching 100% of GDP. To put this in perspective, the United States and Japan have government debt-to-GDP ratios of 122% and 255%, respectively. Government Leverage As such, the PBOC is likely to continue its easing cycle by cutting the policy rates used to set bank deposit rates, home mortgage rates, and interbank lending. They are also likely to continue lowering the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve, rather than lend out. In theory, this increases borrowing. However, as we have long observed, more supply of capital does not necessarily create more demand for it. China’s credit growth has remained sluggish throughout the recent rate cut cycle. China’s economic headwinds have been driven by lower housing prices and the resulting negative wealth effect, which has weighed on domestic consumption due to real estate accounting for an outsized portion of the average household’s wealth. Policymakers, therefore, need to do far more to revive consumer and business confidence. The 2024 stimulus measures were just the beginning, in our view. China Equities Remain Attractive Over Bonds, US Equities Going into 2025, China’s monetary policy stance is currently the most accommodative among the major economies. The yield on the 10-year government bond dropped to an all-time low of 1.82% on December 11th, 2024. 10-Year Yield China’s current 10-year yield is the fourth lowest among the five largest economies globally. Only Japan’s is lower, but the Bank of Japan has begun what is likely a long-term rate hike cycle. ECONOMIES The combination of a low risk-free rate and high dividend yields make for an exceedingly attractive equity risk premium compared to the United States. Spikes in the equity risk premium, measured by the ratio between the average dividend yield within the MSCI China All Shares Index and the yield on the 10-Year China government bond, tend to precede equity bull runs in China. This is exactly what happened in September after the equity risk premium reached decade highs in August. As you can see in the chart below, the equity risk premium has a strong inverse correlation with stock market returns in China. Index Meanwhile, the opposite is true in the United States, where the equity risk premium is hitting decade lows, and equity markets are reaching all-time highs. ERP Investors in China are taking note and are already allocating to the stock market, as evidenced by a jump in margin collateral, which is used to make leveraged investments or simply trade in margin accounts. Margin 2025 Could See The Expansion of Highly Successful Trade-In Subsidies On the fiscal side, foreign investors have called for indiscriminate “helicopter money” to jumpstart domestic consumption in China. However, China’s policymakers are wary of the “sugar high” that comes from fiscal spending and its aftermath: massive amounts of debt and sticky inflation. Nonetheless, China is spending a considerable amount in a targeted manner and is likely to continue to do so in 2025. Global investors were disappointed by the follow-up announcement from the National People's Congress (NPC) after September’s stimulus round, saying that the additional measures were too focused on real estate and local government finances, rather than direct consumer transfers. However, this view misunderstands the great influence these factors have on domestic consumption. By shoring up local government finances, China’s leaders are ensuring that municipalities can focus on improving business conditions in their districts, raising public sector hiring, and giving contracts to local companies. Shortly after the NPC, many local governments even offered vouchers for certain consumption activities. This was not happening when these municipalities were concerned about land sale revenue. By raising housing prices, the government is reversing the negative wealth effect from the real estate deleveraging campaign. The collapse in housing prices also weighed on the real economy as the housing construction employment ecosystem contracted. Policy Although total retail sales have not yet recovered, we have seen the beginning of a recovery in real estate transaction volume and housing prices, which we believe is likely to continue in 2025. Housing In July, the tax authorities rolled out a significant package of trade-in subsidies for autos and home appliances. Moreover, the policy has already produced results as the year-over-year growth in purchases of both home appliances and autos far exceeded overall retail sales growth in November. Retail Sales What categories could be next? We believe it will likely be the product categories that provide the most downstream employment. Auto and appliance manufacturers are major employers in China. BYD alone employs over half a million people. Autos Using employment impact as a yardstick, trade-in subsidies may soon target technology and even the restaurant and food service industries, which have already been the targets of some local voucher programs. Local Services Internet: A Key Beneficiary of Stimulus Internet companies have become the transmission engines of China’s economy. This means they are likely to benefit from stimulus policies first, especially policies around consumption. As a result, internet firms have some of the highest earnings expectations among companies in China. MSCI China Index We believe that 2025 could see China’s markets become more driven by fundamentals as it has now been confirmed that the government is determined to support the economy. In China’s internet sector, free cash flow yield, buybacks, and dividends have stepped up significantly. We believe this is likely to continue into 2025, making China’s internet large caps potentially more attractive than their US counterparts. China Internet This is compounded by the fact that China’s internet firms, despite the run-up in performance in 2024, remain undervalued compared to their US counterparts, trading at nearly one-half of the earnings multiple. P/E Could China Begin to Address Structural Challenges in 2025? China has an exceedingly high savings rate, which means a lower propensity to consume. The high savings rate is a consequence of an individual’s responsibility for their own retirement and health care costs. Another structural factor that weighs on China’s economy and consumption level is the hukou system, which restricts migrant workers from utilizing public services in the cities where they live. 2025 could represent a turning point when China’s government is finished de-risking and deleveraging (Internet Regulation in 20-21 and Real Estate in 23– 24) and embarks on a journey to carry out long-awaited structural reforms to address the issues mentioned above. We believe the government did not have the confidence to do so when these areas, among others, were perceived to be overstretched. This could lead to some near-term sentiment improvements but represents a long-term development. Through reforms, we believe China can effectively tackle issues such as lower consumer confidence and demographic decline. Health Care Reform Having successfully completed an antigraft campaign in the healthcare industry in 2024, based on official statements, the government may now be finally confident enough to improve the services offered by the public healthcare system. This would also boost consumer confidence, as middle-income and lower households would no longer find it necessary to pay for private health care. Hukou System Reform Under the current system, China’s migrant workers are prohibited from accessing public services such as education and health care in the tier-1 and tier-2 cities in which they are employed until they can establish at least five years of residency in those cities. As a result, many leave families behind in their villages so that their children can attend school. Meanwhile, those in need of medical care must bear the expense of returning to their hometowns, often to receive a lower standard of care than they would have in their cities of employment. Making it faster and easier for these workers to establish residency and avail themselves of public services where they work would generate a significant boost to consumer confidence, as these workers would no longer have to maintain a high “rainy day fund”, a key driver of China’s high household savings rate. Meanwhile, they would be able to bring their children with them, who can then take advantage of better educational opportunities in tier-1 and tier-2 cities and eventually replace China’s rapidly aging skilled workforce. Are China Stocks The Ultimate Trump Trade? We believe there are solid reasons to believe that a second Trump Administration will end up being positive for the US-China relationship and China's equity market. Trump invited Xi Jinping himself to attend his inauguration. Although the leader is unlikely to be physically present at the event, we believe the invitation is symbolic of Trump's desire to bring Xi to the bargaining table. The Biden Administration, by contrast, kept all of Trump's tariffs intact, instituted more trade restrictions, and engaged in precious few strategic talks with China to relieve stress on the relationship. There have been other signs of Trump's conciliatory, "Art of The Deal" approach to China. These include the removal, at the behest of Trump, Elon Musk, and their loyalists, of outbound China investment restrictions in the Continuing Resolution (CR), passed in December, to keep the government funded into the new year as well as Trump's stated resolve to reverse the ban on TikTok, the popular social media platform owned by the China-based technology company Bytedance. In our opinion, Trump's election was the best possible outcome for the US-China relationship at the current juncture. President-Elect Trump’s tariff threats have prevented many investors from allocating to China equities despite the compelling valuations and improving policy environment. However, the tariff lens should not be applied to China in a vacuum, as even Mexico and Canada were hit with similar tariff threats. Moreover, exports to the United States now represent only 14% of China’s total exports, down from 21% in 2006. As such, even assuming that some more tariffs are put on, the potential impact on China's economy overall is likely to be limited. China Exports China’s trade with broader Asia has increased significantly as China-based companies have been de-risking away from the US, just as US companies claim they are doing vis-à-vis China. We believe Trump is uniquely positioned to have a “Nixon goes to China” moment, striking a grand bargain that piggybacks off his Phase One trade deal from 2020 through an unconventional approach to diplomacy. Xi’s invitation to the inauguration is further evidence in support of our view. The US needs China as much as China needs the US and tariffs have a history of being ineffective and even economically detrimental. Under the Hoover Administration following the stock market crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was passed, which raised tariffs on over 20,000 goods entering the US by 20% or more. Many economic historians credit the Act with prolonging the Great Depression by keeping consumer prices high. As a businessperson, Trump knows that tariffs should not be a long-standing policy, rather, they should be a negotiating tool. This view is evidenced by the first Trump Administration's decision to cut instituted tariffs in half upon reaching the "Phase One" trade deal in 2020. Will leverage be applied to get a great deal for the American people? 100%, but President Trump is very aware of the US stock market and the US economy’s strong position. Conclusion China’s equity markets are likely to continue the upward trend that began in 2024 on further stimulus, the delayed release of policies already implemented, and the potential kickstarting of badly-needed structural reforms. We believe internet companies may continue to outperform. While policy error is always a risk, we remain confident that China’s government will continue down the path of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy in 2025 and that the Trump Administration will seek a “grand bargain” with China, albeit through some tough negotiation.

Title: What’s up with… Ligado Networks, AWS, Samsung
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ligado-networks-aws-samsung-52070/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:25:02Z

Jan 8, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ligado Networks files for bankruptcy protection, strikes a commercial deal with AST SpaceMobile and takes former partner Inmarsat to court; Amazon Web Services is set to pump $11bn into new infrastructure in the state of Georgia to support AI and cloud services; Samsung’s Q4 sales and profits improve year on year but are still disappointing; and much more! Ligado Networks is having an interesting week. The Reston, Virginia-based company, which has aspirations to be a provider of satellite communications and private 5G networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following an agreement with the majority of its investors to convert $7.8bn of their debt into preferred shares and provide $115m in funds to keep the company up and running. When it emerges from the Chapter 11 process, Ligado expects to have a debt pile of $1.2bn, compared with the $8.6bn it has currently. As part of its restructuring process, Ligado has also struck a complex commercial agreement with direct-to-cell (D2C) low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite specialist AST SpaceMobile that will see Ligado get a $550m payment form its new partner as well as warrants that can be converted into AST SpaceMobile stock (currently valued at about $120m) in 12 months’ time. In return, AST Spacemobile gets the rights to use Ligado’s valuable L-band spectrum in the 1.6 GHz band, which the company believes will significantly help its planned D2C services – AST SpaceMobile already has service agreements with AT&T and Verizon in the US (as well as more than 40 others around the world). “Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering,” stated Abel Avellan, chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. “Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbit/s, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones.” As if that wasn’t enough, Ligado has also filed a lawsuit against satellite operator Inmarsat Global, citing an “intentional and wilful breach” of an agreement to help support Ligado’s plans in the US. Ligado said it agreed to make significant payments so that Inmarsat could upgrade its satellite terminals to avoid interference with Ligado’s services. “In exchange for Inmarsat’s efforts and the rights to use portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum bands, Ligado paid Inmarsat over $1.7bn, including a one-time lump-sum $250m ‘transition payment’... [but] Inmarsat has failed to honour its obligations under the agreement by neglecting to upgrade its own satellite terminals, deliver to Ligado portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum, and assist Ligado in its efforts to gain permission from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] to pursue its goal of providing nationwide terrestrial wireless services to expand America’s 5G capabilities,” claimed Ligado, which is asking for a court order that would require Inmarsat to “perform its contractual duties” as well as pay compensation damages and “repay the billions Ligado paid and lost due to Inmarsat’s intentional inaction.” That’s known as a ‘big ask’. Inmarsat, which is now part of Viasat following a 2023 acquisition, told Reuters that the complaint had no legal merit and was replete with “unfounded allegations”. Another day, another massive datacentre infrastructure investment announcement. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the clear leader in the global cloud services sector, plans to invest at least $11bn to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in the US state of Georgia, a move that is expected to “create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs” in technical roles, such as datacentre engineers, network specialists, engineering operations managers and security specialists, the company has announced. The catalyst for the investment is, not surprisingly, the ongoing demand for AI workloads. “Generative AI is driving increased demand for advanced cloud infrastructure and compute power, and AWS’s investments will support the future of AI from datacentres in Georgia,” noted the company. “AWS datacentres are flexible enough to efficiently run GPUs (graphics processing units) for traditional workloads or AI and machine-learning models. This deployment of cutting-edge AI infrastructure will strengthen Georgia’s position as an innovation hub,” it added. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” stated Roger Wehner, VP of economic development at AWS. “We are delighted to expand our infrastructure into Georgia with this planned multibillion-dollar investment, which we expect to create more than 550 well-paying jobs and drive significant economic growth for the state. State and local leaders have cultivated an environment that enables companies like AWS to make bold, forward-looking investments. We are excited to deepen our partnership with the state of Georgia and contribute to the continued advancement of its thriving technology landscape,” he added. The news comes just a few weeks after AWS announced a $10bn investment in Ohio and days after Microsoft, the second-largest global hyperscaler, announced that it is on track to invest $80bn in AI datacentres around the world during its current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025, and that more than half of that total will be invested in the US. The US investment news comes just as AWS also announced that its latest Asia Pacific “Infrastructure Region”, in Thailand, is now up and running, comprising three “Availability Zones” in the country. It becomes AWS’s 14th Infrastructure Region in Asia Pacific, joining Hong Kong, Hyderabad (India), Jakarta (Indonesia), Malaysia, Melbourne (Australia), Mumbai (India), Osaka (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), and Tokyo (Japan), as well as the Beijing and Ningxia Regions in China. AWS noted that the “adoption of cloud computing has gained significant momentum in Thailand, driven by evolving business needs and government initiatives, such as Thailand 4.0. These initiatives aim to transform Thailand into an innovation-driven economy by using emerging technologies to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. Samsung estimates that its fourth-quarter revenues will come in at 75tn Korean won ($51.bn), up by just over 10% year on year, while its operating profit for the quarter is expected to be about 6.5tn Korean won ($4.45bn), up by 130% year on year, the giant tech vendor noted in this press release. While the numbers are better than a year ago, they are below what had been forecast by financial analysts, even Samsung is disappointed. “Our operating profit for Q4 2024 is projected to come in significantly below market expectations,” it admitted in this note for investors, stating that its numbers were hampered by “increased R&D expenses aimed at securing future technology leadership and the initial ramp-up costs tied to expanding production capacity for advanced technologies”. According to this Reuters report, Samsung has been “hit hard by extra costs as it works towards providing high-end chips to Nvidia”. Currently, the main supplier of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) processors used in Nvidia’s in-demand graphics processing units (GPUs) is one of Samsung’s main rivals, South Korea’s SK Hynix: Nvidia would like to source HBM products from Samsung but its products are not currently meeting Nvidia’s requirements. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, told reporters at the CES 2025 event in Las Vegas, where Huang delivered the opening keynote on Monday evening, that Samsung needs to “engineer a new design” to supply HBM chips to Nvidia, adding that “they can do it and they are working very fast.” Another company that supplies HBM chips to Nvidia is Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology, which is bolstering its presence in Asia Pacific with an investment of $7bn over the next five years or so in a new HBM advanced packaging facility located next to the company’s current facilities in Singapore. Operations for the new facility are scheduled to begin in 2026, with meaningful expansion of Micron’s total advanced packaging capacity beginning in 2027 “to meet the demands of AI growth,” the company noted in this announcement. “As AI adoption proliferates across industries, the demand for advanced memory and storage solutions will continue to increase robustly,” stated Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron. “With the continued support of the Singapore government, our investment in this HBM advanced packaging facility strengthens our position to address the expanding AI opportunities ahead.” Micron’s share price jumped this week after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang namechecked Micron as a key component supplier for Nvidia’s new Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs (graphics processing units) that Huang unveiled during his keynote speech at CES 2025: Micron’s share price currently stands at $101.91, up by more than 13% since the start of this week. Generative AI (GenAI) system developer Anthropic, in which Amazon is a major investor, is in the process of raising $2bn in a new funding round that would value the company at $60bn, Bloomberg has reported. Anthropic, best known for its Claude large language models (LLMs), also counts SK Telecom as one of its investors – the two companies are working together on the development of a multilingual telecom sector-specific LLM called TelClaude. Which leads us on to yet more US datacentre investment news… Middle East datacentre operator Edgenex, a unit of Dubai-based property giant Damac Group (which is also an investor in Anthropic!), plans to invest $20bn in new facilities across the US in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, Gulf Business has reported. Damac chairman Hussain Sajwani, who has positioned himself as an ally of Donald Trump, announced the move with the US president-elect during a press conference held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “The investment will support massive new datacentres across the Midwest, the Sun Belt area, and also to keep America on the cutting-edge of technology and artificial intelligence,” stated Trump. “This is an extremely exciting moment for us. Our foray into the US market in datacentres represents a significant milestone in our journey to build a global digital infrastructure platform that will empower businesses today and in the future,” Sajwani said in a statement. Sajwani isn’t the only international tech tycoon pledging to invest in the US during Trump’s second term as president: In December, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son pledged to invest $100bn in the US during Trump’s upcoming tenure, with the investments set to focus (not surprisingly) on AI and its supporting infrastructure, CNBC reported. Only days after announcing a new chief global affairs officer in the form of former Republican White House deputy chief of staff, Joel Kaplan, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has further cosied up to US president elect Donald Trump by announcing, in a blog titled More Speech and Fewer Mistakes, that it will end its “current third-party fact-checking programme in the United States and instead begin moving to a Community Notes programme” in a move the company is positioning as one that defends free speech. As you can imagine, that’s not quite how everyone sees it… – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 9, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: WooCommerce Extensions: 8 Must-Haves To Turn Your Store From Blah to Brilliant
URL: https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/woocommerce-extensions/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
“I’ve got my e-commerce store up, but sales are stagnant. I feel like I’m missing something.” We frequently hear this from small business owners. And you know what? They’re right. Having a basic WooCommerce shop isn’t enough anymore. Your customers expect seamless checkouts, personalized recommendations, and flexible payment options. WooCommerce extensions can help fix this — They’re tiny power-ups for your online store that come together to make things simpler. With over six million active WooCommerce stores worldwide and a 35% global e-commerce market share, you can be sure that successful WooCommerce stores aren’t using the basic platform alone. They’re using extensions to create exceptional shopping experiences that keep customers coming back. In this guide, we’ll explain: Read on to take your WooCommerce store from bland to brilliant. Think of WooCommerce as your store’s foundation. It gives you the basics: product pages, a shopping cart, and checkout. However, running your e-commerce store requires more. That’s where WooCommerce extensions come in. Extensions are add-ons that enhance your store’s capabilities. They’re like apps for your smartphone — each one offers a new feature to make your store run better. If you don’t already have it, here’s how to install WooCommerce on WordPress. You’ll find two types of WooCommerce extensions on the market: Pro tip: Start with free extensions to understand what your store needs. Then, invest in premium options for the features that matter most to your business. If you’re considering which e-commerce platform will work for you, this article comparing WooCommerce and Shopify is a great starting point. Extensions improve your store’s functionality for you and your customers. We’ve watched hundreds of store owners transform their businesses with these tools, and we’ll share exactly how each one could help you. Here are eight extensions from the WooCommerce marketplace that can help you transform your store. Subscribe now to receive all the latest updates, delivered directly to your inbox. First things first, let’s talk about payments. To maintain a top-notch customer experience, you need to make checkout seamless on your websites. Remember the last time you had to accept multiple payment systems and reports? WooPayments brings everything into one place, right in your WooCommerce dashboard. Key features: Why it works: You’ll spend less time managing payments and more time growing your business. Plus, having everything in one place makes tax season much less stressful. Stripe is a decade-old payments company with a simple goal: making payments as easy as possible. Some of the largest companies today use Stripe, including Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Marriott, and the list goes on and on. Key features: Why it works: The easier you make it to pay, the more sales you’ll complete. If your customers can checkout with one click, they’re more likely to purchase from you. Sometimes, having a familiar logo is all you need to push a customer into making a purchase. PayPal has been a trusted payment provider for over two decades, and it’s impossible to deny its popularity among customers. Accepting PayPal payments on your store can be a great way to add a sense of familiarity. Key features: Why it works: Many customers feel more confident buying from a new store when they see PayPal as an option. It’s especially useful if you’re just starting out or if you’re targeting first-time customers. Plus, the Buy Now, Pay Later option often encourages larger purchases — helpful when you sell higher-priced items. After streamlining the payments, you must strategize how to attract customers. This is where extensions let you focus on marketing while they handle the technicalities. Getting your products in front of the right customers can be challenging. Google for WooCommerce connects your store directly to where most shopping journeys begin — Google Search. Key features: Why it works: Your products appear in Google Shopping results, Google Search, and even Google Images — places where customers are actively looking to buy. This also improves SEO for your store, giving you an additional channel to bring in customers. Ever wonder how major retailers seem to know exactly what to suggest next? Amazon does this well. It suggests highly relevant products on the product and cart pages to encourage buyers to add more products to their order. This extension brings that same smart recommendation engine to your store. Key features: Why it works: When customers see products that match their interests, they’re likely to buy more products and stick around longer— helping improve your website conversion rate. A website conversion is any action a user takes on a site that moves them further into the sales funnel. Examples include filling out a web form, clicking a call to action, or purchasing a product. Discounts can be powerful, but basic percentage-off coupons aren’t always the answer. Advanced Coupons lets you create promotions that make the most sense for your business. Key features: Why it works: You can create promotions that encourage larger purchases while protecting your margins. This tool is particularly useful during seasonal sales or when you need to move specific inventory. Window shopping has gone digital. A wishlist lets customers save items for later, creating a bridge between browsing and buying. Key features: Why it works: Customers often need time to decide on purchases. Wishlists keep them connected to your store and make it easy to return and complete their purchase when they’re ready. Every customer is unique, and sometimes they want products that reflect that. Product Add-Ons lets you offer customization options. Key features: Why it works: When customers can personalize their purchases, they’re not just buying a product — they’re creating something unique. This often leads to higher satisfaction and repeat purchases. While Jetpack isn’t a WooCommerce-specific extension, but it is a powerful WordPress toolkit created by Automattic (the team behind WordPress) that can bolster your store’s security and performance. Instead of juggling multiple plugins for backups, spam filtering, analytics, and speed enhancements, Jetpack provides an all-in-one solution: Jetpack handles essential tasks like security checks and performance optimizations so can you focus on running your store. With its all-in-one support, you’ll have a stable, secure foundation for long-term growth. Not everyone needs the extensive customization that comes with WooCommerce. Sometimes you need something that just works out of the box, with minimal setup and maintenance. Instead of managing multiple extensions, Ecwid gives you everything in one dashboard: The best part? You get essential e-commerce features without managing multiple extensions or handling the technicalities. And as your business grows, you can unlock more features and product listings to further enhance your store. Both WooCommerce and Ecwid can get you where you need to go. You just need to choose the amount of customizability and features you want to manage independently. Too much of anything can be harmful. This also applies to WooCommerce extensions. You want to keep your site as light as possible while still gaining the features you need. Let’s look at how you can go about it. Instead of thinking, “I need more extensions,” ask yourself these questions: Begin with extensions that solve your most pressing problems. This could include issues such as a slow website, a large number of uncompressed images, or a lack of cart abandonment recovery. You can always add more later as different opportunities appear. Here’s something many store owners learn the hard way: every extension can impact your store’s speed. Think of it like filling your car up with luggage. At some point, it will be way too heavy and affect performance. So, what should you watch for? Installing extensions doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s your straightforward process: Always back up your store. You can also use a plugin like Updraft Plus to auto-backup before installing or updating any WooCommerce themes or plugins. Then, download the extension from the WooCommerce marketplace. Alternatively, you can click on Plugins > Add New Plugin from the left sidebar on your WordPress dashboard. Here, you can search for the required plugins. If you’ve downloaded a zip file from the WooCommerce marketplace, simply click the Upload Plugin button at the top of the Add New Plugin page. After the upload completes, you’ll have the option to activate the plugin. Note: Always test new extensions on a staging site first. It’s like trying on clothes before buying — it’s better to know if something fits before committing. Every added extension needs maintenance. That’s yet another reason to keep things light. The good news is that WooCommerce and WordPress provide automatic updates, minimizing the need for manual maintenance. Here are some key things to remember with website maintenance: Remember: your store’s security is only as strong as its weakest link. Choose extensions from trusted sources and keep everything updated. The WooCommerce Marketplace is your safest bet. WooCommerce may seem overwhelming compared to newer, more streamlined platforms. However, this flexibility is exactly what makes it powerful. You can build precisely the store you need, piece by piece, without being locked into a one-size-fits-all solution. WooCommerce extensions are the building blocks that help make that happen. Start small, keep testing, and retain flexibility while building your store. The most successful stores aren’t the ones with the most WooCommerce extensions or features — they’re the ones that have figured out exactly what works for their store and what doesn’t. If you find setting up your store too complex, let the professional e-commerce store developers handle it. At DreamHost, we’ve helped thousands of store owners build and grow their online presence. Ready to get started? Let our experts set up your WooCommerce store with all the right extensions, optimized for performance and ready to start selling.

Title: AMD downgraded, Carvana upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded Carvana (CVNA) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $277, up from $195. The firm cites improving new vehicle supply unlocking used demand and says Carvana inventory is expanding to meet demand. Piper Sandler upgraded Autodesk (ADSK) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $357, up from $311. While the "efficiency narrative" has been building since mid-last year, the post-Q3 pullback in the shares has created an attractive entry point for a stock "that felt a little crowded on the long side" for much of the last six months, the firm tells investors in a research note. Mizuho upgraded Twilio (TWLO) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $85, ahead of the company's January 23 investor day. The firm expects "meaningful" sales stabilization and improved revenue visibility for Twilio, and sees opportunity for acceleration to double-digit growth in 2025 and beyond. TD Cowen upgraded Coca-Cola (KO) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $75. Coke continues to execute "at the top of its game" through successful refranchising internationally and outstanding execution domestically, argues the firm, which views the stock's recent pullback as an "overreaction to transitory volume deceleration" and "nebulous concerns" about the impact of new U.S. trade policies on forex and Coke's emerging markets. Wolfe Research upgraded UPS (UPS) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $147 price target. The stock has materially lagged FedEx (FDX), the broader Transport Index and the S&P 500 over the past two and a half years as U.S. package margins have declined materially, but the firm expects U.S. margins to inflect positive year-over-year in calendar 2025, which "historically leads to much better performance for the stock." Top 5 Downgrades: HSBC downgraded AMD (AMD) to Reduce from Buy with a price target of $110, down from $200. AMD shares price have corrected by 24% in the past three months but there remains further downside as the firm now believes the company's artificial intelligence graphics processing unit roadmap is less competitive than previously thought. TD Cowen downgraded Leidos (LDOS) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $165, down from $200. The company faces a transition in 2025 following 2024's "explosive growth," which limits the stock's upward re-rating prospects, the firm tells investors in a research note. BTIG downgraded Palo Alto Networks (PANW) to Neutral from Buy without a price target. After reviewing Palo Alto's share in its core network security target market and the drivers within its higher growth next-generation security platform business, the firm no longer thinks the company is a sustainable 15%-plus growth story. Deutsche Bank also downgraded Palo Alto Networks to Hold from Buy with a price target of $190, down from $207. Deutsche Bank downgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $475, down from $600. The firm believes Adobe will continue to build traction with Firefly and other generative artificial intelligence offerings, but expects the stock to remain range-bound until that momentum positively inflects in the financials. Truist downgraded Merck (MRK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $110, down from $130. The firm warns that a major upcoming loss of exclusivity and Gardasil headwinds are seen carrying over from 2024, and while the company should navigate through the environment, it will take time to reflect in growth. Top 5 Initiations: TD Cowen initiated coverage of Axon (AXON) with a Buy rating and $700 price target. Axon has built an ecosystem for public safety and enjoys high market share with durable competitive advantages, the firm says, adding that its customer checks "were very bullish." Benchmark initiated coverage of Lithia & Driveway (LAD) with a Buy rating and $400 price target. L&D has executed the most aggressive and successful M&A strategy in a still highly fragmented industry that supports consolidation and where large dealerships enjoy favorable competitive dynamics, the firm tells investors. Stifel resumed coverage of Builders FirstSource (BLDR) with a Buy rating and $175 price target. Amid the "robust" valuations prevailing across building products and home improvement, Builders FirstSource's discounted valuation is "compelling" against Stifel's long-term enthusiasm, with the firm's outlook suggesting mid-teens return of market capitalization via share repurchase at current levels. Stifel resumed coverage of Beacon (BECN) with a Buy rating and $115 price target. The firm says Beacon's successful execution against "Project 2025" Initiatives drives confidence in the company's ability to outperform the U.S. roofing category growth while enhancing its leading position and growth prospects through greenfield expansion and acquisitions. Barclays initiated coverage of Levi Strauss (LEVI) with an Overweight rating and $24 price target. The firm believes the company's organic sales in 2025 should accelerate driven by wholesale normalization, growth in women's and tops, and newness in denim. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq inch lower with Trump tariff push, rate cuts in focus

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks wavered on Wednesday as investors absorbed a report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency to pave the way for proposed tariffs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each slipped just below the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) jumped as high as 4.72% to hold near an eight-month highs. Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs, CNN reported. The news jolted markets already on guard for Trump economic surprises as Inauguration Day nears, bracing for a wave of policy moves and executive orders. Investors are keeping a close eye on prospects for the economy as they gauge shifts in the chances of slower interest-rate cuts this year. Federal Reserve minutes due later could reset their bets. Stocks sold off and the benchmark Treasury yield spiked on Tuesday as service sector and labor market readings revived concerns over stubborn inflation. The data gives weight to Fed officials' hints that they will lower rates slower than foreseen, and traders now see a less than 50% chance of any easing before June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Markets could switch back to viewing strong economic data releases as negative and a spur to "higher for longer" rates, some analysts believe. US private companies slowed their headcount growth in December, signaling moderating demand for hiring. According to ADP Research Institute data, private firms added 122,000 jobs in December, the lowest amount since August. But the number of Americans making jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, pointing to a stable labor market, official figures showed. The data was released a day early as government offices are closed for a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter on Thursday. That labor data, along with the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday afternoon, will feed into expectations for the crucial December jobs report release on Friday. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) stock nudged higher as it struggled to recover from a rout that erased $220 billion in market value. Stocks wobbled at the open on Wednesday as investors assessed a news report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell to just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also broadly flat, after volatile premarket trading. Investors are on edge over the prospect of slower interest rate cuts this year if inflation remains sticky. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said he still supports cutting interest rates this year. He believes inflation will continue to drift lower, despite promises of sweeping tariffs from the new Trump administration. A CNN report on Wednesday morning said Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs. Another day, another report suggesting president-elect Donald Trump will look for creative solutions to impose broad tariffs on America's trading partners. CNN's Kayla Tausche reported early Wednesday that Trump "is considering declaring a national economic emergency to provide legal justification for a large swath of universal tariffs on allies and adversaries." Following the report, stock futures pared gains and traded into negative territory. About an hour before the market open, futures were little-changed. Wednesday's market reaction is the inverse of what investors saw Monday, when a report from the Washington Post suggested Trump may look to narrow the scope of his tariff proposals. After markets cheered that story, the president-elect denied it. But the back and forth seen in the major stock indexes on Trump's tariff bluster continues to play second fiddle to the most important factor for investors right now: the Federal Reserve. Tuesday's sell-off is the latest case in point. Inflation data inside the ISM's latest manufacturing PMI report, coupled with job openings data that showed an uptick in labor demand during November, saw markets price out another 0.25% rate cut from the Fedin 2025. In turn, the Nasdaq fell almost 2% with stalwarts like Nvidia (NVDA) losing 6% after reaching an all-time high earlier in the session. As Trump's inauguration approaches, investors and newshounds will see many echoes of the run-up to his 2017 inauguration in recent newsflow — everything is on the table: renaming bodies of water, annexing Greenland, and so on. Because markets don't jump to price in the maximum risk posed by every Trump proposal doesn't mean they don't matter. But the Fed meets 8 times a year to vote on monetary policy, and interest rates are the most important driver of stock prices over the long term.

Markets could switch back to viewing strong economic data releases as negative and a spur to "higher for longer" rates, some analysts believe. US private companies slowed their headcount growth in December, signaling moderating demand for hiring. According to ADP Research Institute data, private firms added 122,000 jobs in December, the lowest amount since August. But the number of Americans making jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, pointing to a stable labor market, official figures showed. The data was released a day early as government offices are closed for a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter on Thursday. That labor data, along with the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday afternoon, will feed into expectations for the crucial December jobs report release on Friday. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) stock nudged higher as it struggled to recover from a rout that erased $220 billion in market value. Stocks wobbled on Wednesday morning after volatile pre-market trading as investors assessed a news report that President-elect Donald Trump is considering declaring a national economic emergency in order to follow through with a broad tariff plan. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell just below the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed. Investors are on edge over the prospects of slower interest-rate cuts this year if inflation remains sticky. Meanwhile Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said that he still supports cutting interest rates this year, believing inflation will continue to drift lower, despite promises of sweeping tariffs from the new Trump administration. A CNN report on Wednesday morning said Trump is looking to the emergency powers to provide a legal basis for his proposed hefty and wide-ranging tariffs Another day, another report suggesting president-elect Donald Trump will look for creative solutions to impose broad tariffs on America's trading partners. CNN's Kayla Tausche reported early Wednesday that Trump "is considering declaring a national economic emergency to provide legal justification for a large swath of universal tariffs on allies and adversaries." Following the report, stock futures pared gains and traded into negative territory. About an hour before the market open, futures were little-changed. Wednesday's market reaction is the inverse of what investors saw Monday, when a report from the Washington Post suggested Trump may look to narrow the scope of his tariff proposals. After markets cheered that story, the president-elect denied it. But the back and forth seen in the major stock indexes on Trump's tariff bluster continues to play second fiddle to the most important factor for investors right now: the Federal Reserve. Tuesday's sell-off is the latest case in point. Inflation data inside the ISM's latest manufacturing PMI report, coupled with job openings data that showed an uptick in labor demand during November, saw markets price out another 0.25% rate cut from the Fedin 2025. In turn, the Nasdaq fell almost 2% with stalwarts like Nvidia (NVDA) losing 6% after reaching an all-time high earlier in the session. As Trump's inauguration approaches, investors and newshounds will see many echoes of the run-up to his 2017 inauguration in recent newsflow — everything is on the table: renaming bodies of water, annexing Greenland, and so on. Because markets don't jump to price in the maximum risk posed by every Trump proposal doesn't mean they don't matter. But the Fed meets 8 times a year to vote on monetary policy, and interest rates are the most important driver of stock prices over the long term.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) The bitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) is one of the most volatile and traded equities on the market. Volatility within an equity can be beneficial as it allows for high-volume trading. Even though MicroStrategy has a market cap of less than $100 billion, its trading volume rivals that of the magnificent seven technology companies. All the seven magnificent tech stocks have a market cap of at least $1 trillion, well over ten times the market capitalization of MicroStrategy, with Apple (APPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) having market caps of over $3 trillion. Data from Market Chameleon shows that between Dec. 2, 2024, to Jan. 7, 2025, an average of nearly 24 million MSTR shares were traded daily. This would place MicroStrategy sixth out of the other tech stocks, above Microsoft (MSFT), which trades 20 million shares daily, and META (META), which trades 12.2 million shares daily. The clear winner is NVIDIA, with Tesla (TSLA) in second place. MicroStrategy is up around 14% year to date, with a 30-day implied volatility (IV) of 104; IV determines the market's expectation of future price movements for the asset over the next 30-day period. The IV comes from options pricing, and considering that iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has an IV of around 60, this would make MSTR 1.7 times more volatile than IBIT. As of Jan. 7 data, MicroStrategy has the highest IV30 of 105, the highest out of all seven magnificent tech stocks, with Tesla as its closest rival with an IV30 of 71.0, according to market chameleon data.

With Tom Capper, we will dive into fresh data comparing the prevalence of AI Overviews by industry, geographic location, search intent stage and more, along with what factors correlate with appearing in them. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. Focus on these nine basic steps to optimise your site to help boost your ranking Many things have changed in SEO since Google first came online in 1998. Today, with personalized results influenced by user behavior, location, and device, standing out in search engine results is more challenging than ever. The one thing that hasn’t changed is this: Your organic traffic is directly tied to your search engine ranking positions (SERPs). If your keywords rank at or near the top of Google’s search results, boundless traffic will follow. Conversely, a lack of visibility in the SERPs will leave your site struggling to attract organic traffic, regardless of its quality. In this guide, I’ll break down actionable steps to boost your rankings. I’m going to go out on a limb here and give you the definitive answer, “It depends.” While I recognize this is frustrating and seems like a cop-out, it’s the truth. SEO doesn’t happen in a vacuum and every situation offers a unique set of variables. Skill, budget, the level of competition, and how your website stacks up can all play a role in how quickly one can move the dial. Google’s John Mueller has said it can take “several hours to several weeks” for Google to index new or updated content. However, even with drastic changes, it can take months – or even a year – to see a significant impact. Mueller recommends: The best way to rank faster? Create high-quality, useful content that searchers will love. In Mueller’s words, make your site “fantastic.” Poor website structure and information architecture can doom even the best SEO campaigns. If your website is difficult for users to navigate and Google to crawl, your rankings are likely to suffer. Building a solid technical and UX foundation ensures both search engines and users find what they’re looking for. While Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP, FID, and CLS) are important indicators of performance, don’t get bogged down chasing perfect scores. A site that’s technically sound and provides a great user experience will naturally outperform competitors in the long run. Audit your website using Google Search Console’s coverage and crawl stats reports. Identify and fix three major issues this week, such as broken links, slow-loading pages, mobile-friendliness problems, Core Web Vitals issues, or indexing errors. Recheck crawl stats in two weeks to confirm improvements and ensure Google can efficiently index your site. High-quality content that embodies Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) is a cornerstone of modern SEO. Google rewards content that satisfies user intent and offers value, so prioritize crafting pieces that answer real questions and solve problems. Choose your top 3 underperforming URLs in terms of CTR or average position in Google Search Console. Update each with a fresh expert citation or new insights aligned with search intent. Add a new section or FAQ to deepen the content. Track CTR and engagement metrics over the next four weeks to measure improvement. Making your pages engaging and search-engine-friendly requires optimizing both your content and the way it’s structured. This involves crafting concise, descriptive titles, leveraging meta descriptions, and strategically using internal links to enhance user navigation and SEO performance. Identify three underperforming pages with high impressions and low CTR using Google Search Console. Rewrite their meta descriptions to align with searcher intent, incorporating primary keywords naturally. Add at least one internal link to each of these pages from related high-traffic content, using descriptive anchor text. Monitor changes in CTR and engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate) over the next four weeks to assess improvements. Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and enhances your visibility with rich results like star ratings, pricing details, and more. By structuring your data, you make it easier for search engines to deliver relevant information to users directly in the search results. Below is an example of Product schema markup for an ecommerce website: This code includes essential product details such as name, image, description, pricing, availability, and customer ratings, making it eligible for rich search results. Schema.org provides various schema types designed for specific content formats, including: Selecting the appropriate schema type for your content ensures better alignment with user search intent and increases your chances of appearing in rich search results. Select one key product or service page and implement schema markup using JSON-LD format. Validate the code using Google’s Rich Results Test. Track impressions, CTR, and click performance in Google Search Console over two weeks. Aim for at least a 1% CTR improvement, which can translate to 100+ additional clicks if the page receives 10,000 monthly impressions. If the initial implementation is successful, expand schema markup to five additional pages over the next month, focusing on high-traffic content. Google now prioritizes the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking. Ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is no longer optional – it’s essential for SEO success. Key Strategies for Mobile Optimization: Actionable Recommendation Use Google Search Console’s Mobile Usability report to identify pages with issues such as “Text too small to read” or “Clickable elements too close together.” Focus on fixing three key problems, like adjusting text size, improving button spacing, or optimizing navigation. Enhance performance further by compressing images and enabling lazy loading. Monitor bounce rates and mobile impressions in Google Analytics over the next four weeks, aiming for a 5% reduction in bounce rates and improved engagement. Backlinks are still critical for SEO, but the emphasis should be on quality over quantity. Links from reputable websites signal to Google that your site provides authoritative and valuable content. That said, building backlinks isn’t an overnight win – it’s a long-term game that requires patience and consistent effort. Identify three high-authority websites in your niche using a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Develop a targeted outreach plan to pitch high-value content, such as a guest post or a link to an existing guide or resource on your site. Focus on offering genuine value to their audience. Track new backlinks acquired over the next three months using Google Search Console or a backlink monitoring tool, and measure their impact on referral traffic and rankings. Backlink acquisition is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on creating high-quality content that naturally earns links, and steer clear of black-hat tactics – they’ll land you in hot water with Google. Google rewards websites that regularly update their content, as it signals ongoing relevance and authority. Stale or outdated information can damage your credibility and rankings. Review your top five performing pages in Google Analytics. Refresh two pages by adding updated data, insights, or visuals. Track engagement metrics like bounce rate and time on page over the next four weeks, and aim for a 10% improvement in these key performance indicators (KPIs). For local businesses, being visible in local search results can make or break your bottom line. Optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP) and using location-specific keywords are essential steps. Review your Google Business Profile. Add or update three photos, refine your category selection, and ensure your business hours are accurate. Identify three location-specific keywords and incorporate them into your homepage or a key service page. Monitor local impressions in GBP Insights over two weeks to measure impact. If you serve users in multiple countries, international SEO ensures your content resonates with diverse languages, regions, and cultures. Identify your top international markets in Google Analytics. Implement hreflang tags for at least one language or region, and translate your highest-performing page. Monitor international traffic in Google Analytics over three months to track growth. SEO doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Start by implementing one or two actionable steps this week, such as refreshing content, updating your GBP, or optimizing a page for international audiences. Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to track your progress over the next month and adjust as needed. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. By focusing on key strategies like delivering great content, optimizing for mobile and local audiences, and building high-quality backlinks, you can position your site for long-term success. Make incremental improvements, track your metrics, and adapt based on what works. With a consistent approach, you’ll see your rankings, traffic, and engagement improve over time.

Title: A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/a-lesson-in-creativity-and-capitalism-from-two-zany-youtubers
Time Published: 2025-01-08T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Cal Newport is filling in for Kyle Chayka. James Hobson began publishing videos on YouTube in 2006, when he was still a high-school student in Ontario, Canada. His early uploads were crude by today’s standards—some gymnastics tricks, some parkour, and some mildly anarchic silliness (for example, a 2009 clip of Hobson drinking raw eggs). “It was just the easiest way of sharing videos with my friends,” Hobson told me recently. “I would upload on YouTube and then share a link using MSN messenger.” Hobson’s relationship with YouTube began to evolve in 2013, when he crafted a pair of metal claws to help him dress up as Wolverine, the Marvel superhero, for Halloween. The resulting video, which he titled “Make It Real: The Wolverine’s Claws!,” was so popular that photographers asked him to star in photo shoots; a follow-up video in which he electrified the claws earned him a writeup in a tech publication. “That’s kind of cool,” Hobson remembers thinking. A year later, another installment of “Make It Real” showed him building a mechanical exoskeleton of the kind used in “Elysium,” a science-fiction film starring Matt Damon, out of perforated square tubing and compact hydraulic actuators. The exoskeleton attracted even more viewers than the Wolverine claws, and Hobson—a systems mechanical engineer—began to reconsider his line of work. In 2015, Hobson quit his job to become a professional YouTuber, funding the transition by taking money out of his fledgling retirement account and selling laser-engraved goods on Etsy. “I had, like, six months to make it happen,” he recalled. Fortunately for him, his next project, a real-life version of Captain America’s electromagnetic shield, drew millions of views and pushed his subscriber count past five hundred thousand. He began attracting sponsorships and soon was earning enough sponsorships to make his channel financially stable. Hobson then followed a well-worn playbook in the world of creative capitalism, one deployed by numerous startups and scrappy media companies: get as large as you can as fast as you can. “Once we started growing, I was, like, ‘I want a really big property. I want a warehouse and outdoor space and room to do really big projects,’ ” Hobson told me. When he quit his job, he’d been making videos in his garage, but by 2019 he was leasing a thirteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse. In the twenty-twenties, he took out a multimillion-dollar mortgage on an even bigger warehouse, surrounded by forests, ponds, and fields—in his words, “a perfect backdrop for filming.” Hobson, known online as the Hacksmith, called the new location HERC, for Hacksmith Engineering Research Campus. He said it was loosely modelled on the headquarters of Stark Industries in Marvel’s “Iron Man” series. His staff grew to thirty people. At first, the expansion of Hobson’s business kept pace with his ambitions. “We doubled in size year over year,” he told me. “It was pretty darn exponential.” But, when subscriber growth slowed, HERC’s operating costs remained high. Two rounds of layoffs followed, and the company managed to stave off bankruptcy in large part because its online shop, Hacksmith.store, was unexpectedly successful. The classic strategy of scaling up left Hobson disillusioned. When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

Title: Mark Zuckerberg unveils his latest persona: Elon Musk

Time Published: 2025-01-08T09:01:02Z
Full Content:
Meta's about-face on fact-checking shows how Musk has remade the world in his image. While Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never did face off in that cage match, "Uncle Elon" has bested Zuck in the political arena, becoming one of the most powerful unelected figures in modern US history. Now, in hopes of forging a friendlier relationship with the Trump administration a second time around, Zuckerberg seems to be following a new mantra: If you can't beat Elon, be him. On Tuesday, Meta announced it would end third-party fact-checking and replace it with a more hands-off content-moderation policy in which users police one another through community notes — just like Musk's X. In a video announcing the changes, Zuckerberg said that "governments and legacy media" had pushed for more censorship in recent years, and that Meta had decided its "complex systems" had "too many mistakes and too much censorship." "The recent elections," the Meta CEO added, "also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech." His language would have sounded natural coming out of the mouth of Musk, who shared Zuckerberg's video on X and dubbed Meta's move "cool." Community notes is only the latest page Zuckerberg has taken from his billionaire rival's playbook. Whether conducting mass layoffs or removing the guardrails to social media or joining forces with Musk against their shared competitor OpenAI or spending time at Mar-a-Lago, Zuckerberg has been following Musk's lead more often. This isn't the first time Zuckerberg, who has helmed Facebook since he was 19, has reinvented himself. From the brash, hoodie-wearing Harvard dropout in Facebook's early days to the suit-wearing, meat-smoking, Silicon Valley nice guy in the years after the company went public to the hardened, martial-arts-practicing "wartime"-mode Zuck who emerged in the wake of the most turbulent period in company history, Zuckerberg has fashioned several personas that approximate what his company most needs him to be at the time. In 2025, don't let his longer hair, oversize T-shirts, and statement jewelry fool you. The persona Mark Zuckerberg has taken on to ensure Meta's success as his historical adversary Donald Trump returns to the White House acts a lot like Donald Trump's right-hand man, Elon Musk. When Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he shaved content moderation to bare bones in the name of free speech and cut more than 80% of its staff, sending shockwaves through the tech world. Many speculated that Twitter would crack under the pressure, and die. When, despite some hiccups, the platform continued to function largely as normal, Zuckerberg, like several other tech CEOs, applauded Musk for making Twitter "leaner" (doing so on the Musk superfan Lex Fridman's podcast). Meta also laid off 11,000 workers days after Musk took over Twitter, and Zuckerberg then dubbed 2023 "the year of efficiency" at Meta, cutting another 10,000 people. Zuckerberg now also plans to move trust-and-safety workers from California to Texas, following in step with Musk, who has relocated X from San Francisco to Texas, where he has also located Starlink and The Boring Company. And as Zuckerberg stayed quieter throughout the 2024 presidential election after Meta took heat for misinformation in 2016 and 2020, Musk did the opposite. The world's richest man appeared onstage alongside Trump, backed Trump with more than $250 million, and posted to X incessantly in support of the now president-elect. Musk has again come out on top, as he now sits at the pinnacle of political influence and is poised to radically reshape government spending as he and Vivek Ramaswamy spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency. Big Tech's other power players who want a favorable relationship with Trump are left to follow in his path. Since November, Apple's Tim Cook, Open AI's Sam Altman, and Amazon have each donated to Trump's inaugural fund. Zuckerberg has done that and more, including visiting Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with the president-elect; naming UFC CEO Dana White, a close Trump ally, to Meta's board; and promoting Joel Kaplan, a longtime Republican lobbyist, to chief global affairs officer. (On Tuesday, Kaplan gave an interview on "Fox & Friends" to promote the company's content-moderation changes.) All of this is meant to quell a once adversarial relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump, who had threatened to imprison Zuckerberg if his social sites interfered with the 2024 election and years ago accused Facebook of being "anti-Trump" and colluding against him (Zuckerberg pushed back against such claims). As my colleague Peter Kafka wrote of the community notes news: "There's no way to see Zuckerberg's moves as anything other than a straightforward attempt to please Trump and the incoming president's conservative allies, who have often complained that Zuckerberg's properties were biased against them." Even Trump said Tuesday that Meta was "probably" responding to his own past threats against Zuck by pivoting. The very fact-checkers who will soon be dismissed by Meta began with a program in December 2016, after Facebook faced harsh criticism for its role in spreading misinformation in Trump's first election a month prior. Meta actively worked to downplay political content following the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and it suspended Trump from Facebook and Instagram (Meta lifted the suspension in early 2023, saying the public should be able to access what politicians are saying; the move came shortly after Musk allowed Trump back on Twitter). When Meta launched Threads, its own Twitter competitor, in 2023, the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, said the new app would not encourage breaking news and politics posts. But Musk, who has rebuilt X in his own image to favor conservative and far-right accounts, has found that a social-media site can win when embracing the president. On Tuesday, Meta also said it would reverse course and stop downgrading political content, and start phasing politics back into users' feeds. (A Meta spokesperson referred to past public statements but did not provide new comment for this story.) Early research on X's community notes shows the move has led to mixed results when it comes to combating misinformation. But changes at X have certainly proved a mammoth victory for Musk, whose wealth has grown by an estimated $200 billion since the election. As he's molded himself more in Uncle Elon's image, Nephew Zuck may also find himself in Trump's favor. Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

Title: AST SpaceMobile secures long-term spectrum access to advance space-based cellular services
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AST_SpaceMobile_secures_long_term_spectrum_access_to_advance_space_based_cellular_services_999.html
Time Published: 2025-01-08T08:31:04Z

This agreement positions AST SpaceMobile to combine its existing low-band spectrum coverage in the continental United States with premium lower mid-band spectrum access, creating an enhanced framework for reliable and widespread connectivity. The company's advanced communications arrays, the largest deployed in low Earth orbit, will support this integration to deliver better performance across diverse applications. "Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering," said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. "Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones." The agreement, facilitated through a binding Restructuring Support Agreement with Ligado Networks ("Ligado") and its creditors, grants AST SpaceMobile long-term usage rights for 80+ years. This includes up to 40 MHz of L-Band MSS spectrum and an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz Band in the United States. Completion of the transaction depends on finalizing definitive documentation, anticipated in early 2025. Upon execution, Ligado will receive approximately 4.7 million penny warrants convertible into AST SpaceMobile Class A shares, subject to a 12-month lock-up. Regulatory approvals and other conditions will determine the transaction's closing, which also includes $550 million in additional consideration supported by institutional financing. AST SpaceMobile has arranged for a non-recourse senior-secured delayed-draw term loan facility to finance this commitment, with annual payments of approximately $80 million for spectrum rights. Ligado will also receive long-term net revenue sharing rights. The transaction aligns with Ligado's ongoing restructuring efforts. UBS Securities LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor for AST SpaceMobile. Legal counsel includes Freshfields and Sullivan and Cromwell. The company's advancements include the September 2024 launch of five BlueBird satellites, which are the largest commercial communication arrays in orbit. These satellites offer non-continuous broadband services across the United States and select global markets, with the aim of achieving nationwide coverage. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites will feature even larger arrays and deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity, supporting speeds up to 120 Mbps for a full range of cellular services.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.3%. It was boosted by shares of Samsung Electronics, which climbed around 3.6% even as the company forecast that its fourth-quarter profits would come in lower than LSEG expectations. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. India might benefit from Trump, portfolio manager saysU.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's plans to impose heavy tariffs on China make India's geopolitical positioning "favorable in this Trump 2.0 era," according to GIB Asset Management's portfolio manager Kunal Desai. India is an attractive investment destination because of its monetary sovereignty and improving return on equity, Desai said. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shock waves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Meta kills its fact checking programme and house prices keep rising

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Meta is to shut down its third-party fact-checking programme, moving to the so-called community notes model favoured by rival platform X, and lift restrictions it had previously imposed on some topics on its platform.

The announcement came shortly after conservative Joel Kaplan was named as Meta’s new head of global policy, replacing former UK Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. The move also comes a day after the company named three new directors to its board, including Dana White, UFC chief executive and a close friend of US President-elect Donald Trump. Ciara O’Brien reports. House prices across the country will probably rise by as much as 8 per cent this year, according to estate agent DNG, which would bring the average price of a second-hand home in Dublin to almost €630,000. The company, in its latest residential market review and outlook, forecasts prices will “continue to rise”, with an increase of “at least mid-single digit figures” anticipated due to the “continued lack of new homes available to purchase by private buyers”.

We all want to save money if we can, but there are many different places to store your money depending on what you are saving for. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at the issues at play and the options savers have. Angry truckers are accusing a shipping company of price gouging after it doubled charges for some loads on the Irish Sea as a result of Holyhead’s closure. As Barry O’Halloran reports, Luxembourg-based shipping group CLDN has told hauliers ago that it would require a surcharge of twice the normal booking rate for any loads above a company’s “usual allocations”. Barry also reports that a key British division of developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore Group earned €1.6 million profit in the 12 months to March 31st, reversing the previous year’s €6 million loss, accounts show. At least €100 million in warehoused debt from a scheme introduced to help businesses during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic is not recoverable, Revenue has said. Colin Gleeson reports that some €3 billion of the €3.2 billion included in the warehouse at its peak in January 2022 has now been either settled or secured under a phased payment arrangement. Fresh plans for an apartment scheme by Lioncor on the grounds of Terenure College in Dublin have addressed all the grounds for refusal to a previous scheme, according to planning documentation lodged by the developer. Gordon Deegan has read the report. Digital pathology company Deciphex has raised $32.3 million (€31 million) from investors in a new funding round that will help fuel its global expansion. The company secured backing for its Series C round from Molten Ventures, with significant participation from ACT Venture Capital, Seroba, Charles River Laboratories, IRRS Investments, HBAN Medtech Syndicate and Nextsteps Capital. Ciara has the story. Bank of Ireland is to cut rates on certain deposit products, becoming the first domestic bank to do so since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut official borrowing costs last June. Joe Brennan reports. Joe also reports that Deutsche Bank analysts see AIB’s net interest income sliding 11 per cent this year, at almost twice the pace of the other two domestic retail banks, as it downgraded its rating on the AIB’s stock. Novo Banco, the Portuguese bank led by former AIB chief financial officer Mark Bourke, fired its chief risk officer following an internal probe into what the lender described as “suspicious” financial transactions. Planning permission for almost 900 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre in Dublin has been refused following a long-running battle and hundreds of objections from locals.

Title: Bezos-owned Washington Post cuts more jobs, reports say

The Washington Post is laying off nearly 100 workers, or 4% of its staff, in an attempt to stem growing losses. The cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues. The layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry", a spokesperson for the newspaper said. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future." In 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (£45m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%. Mr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the "media is biased." Still, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Since then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed. The apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post. That came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as "an extraordinary political comeback" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder is one of several tech leaders who has made the trip to Mar-a-Lago. In February, Mr Bezos announced that he would sell shares in technology giant worth around $8.5bn. The firm had previously said its founder would sell up to 50 million shares by the end of January 2025. The multi-billionaire moved to Florida last year, which has no state tax on share sales above $250,000. Two Amazon satellites launch to test the tech for a global broadband system in the sky.

January 07, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) Class Period: October 31, 2023 - September 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 24, 2025 The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Discoverer Inspiration and the Development Driller III were considered non-strategic assets; (2) the Company's recorded asset valuations were overstated; (3) as a result, the Company would take nearly twice the vessels' sale price in impairment if sold; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.32%. Shares of Volvo Car closed more than 9% higher after the Swedish carmaker reported a new global sales record for 2024. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. UK's long-term borrowing costs surgeYields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shockwaves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Everything NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced at its CES 2025 keynote
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=175847883
Time Published: 2025-01-07T21:52:07Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA held its CES 2025 keynote last night with CEO Jensen Huang and it was surprisingly eventful. The company finally unveiled its much awaited GeForce RTX 5000 GPUs that promise a considerable performance uplift, to start with. The company didn't stop there, also announcing Project Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, along with DLSS 4 and more. Here's a wrap-up of what happened — and you can watch the whole event uncut, via the YouTube embed below. (Spoiler alert: It's more than 90 minutes long.) Huang strode out in a new snakeskin-like leather jacket and revealed the much-anticipated RTX 5090 GPU. With 32GB of GDDR7 RAM and an impressive 21,760 CUDA cores, the new flagship can deliver up to twice as much relative performance, particularly for ray-tracing (RT) intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077. In fact that particular title ran at 234 fps with full RT on in a video demo, compared to 109 fps on the RTX 4090. It's not cheap, though, priced at $1,999. The company also revealed the $549 RTX 5070 with a far more modest 6,144 CUDA cores and 12GB of DDR7 RAM, along with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti and $999 RTX 5080. A key part of the RTX 5000-series launch was the introduction of DLSS 4, the latest version of the company's real-time image upscaling technology. It features a new technology called Multi Frame Generation that allows the new GPUs to generate up to three additional frames for every one frame the GPU produces via traditional rendering — helping multiply frame rates by up to eight times. It also represents what NVIDIA calls the "biggest upgrade to its AI models" since DLSS 2, improving things like temporal stability and detail, while reducing artifacts like ghosting. Finally, NVIDIA launched Project Digits, a "personal AI supercomputer" designed for AI researchers, data scientists and students. It uses NVIDIA's new GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, providing up to a petaflop of performance for testing and running AI models. The company says a single Project Digits unit can run models 200 billion parameters in size, or multiple machines can be linked together to run up to 405 billion parameter models. And for its intended audience, Project Digits is relatively cheap at $3,000. On top of all that, the company introduced NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for robot and AV development, the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion AV platform for autonomous vehicles and AI Foundation models for RTX PCs "that supercharge digital humans." It's all explained in the video above and NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote blog. CES — and Huang's keynote — are happening against the backdrop of continued volatility in the company's stock price. NVIDIA shares (ticker NVDA) spiked ahead of Huang's address, closing on Monday just shy of Apple's market cap pinnacle. But Tuesday saw a reversal, with the stock down more than 6 percent. Still, some are betting it's a toss up between the two tech giants as to which will hit the $4 trillion market valuation first. Update, January 7 2025, 4:18PM ET: This story has been updated with new details on Nvidia's stock price.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies. Trump revealed on Tuesday that Damac Group, based in Dubai and backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, will invest $20 billion into the build-out. "They feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it," the president-elect said during a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago. "It's an honor to have such a great investor." Trump said the investment will be used to create "massive new data centers" across the Midwest and Sunbelt regions "and keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence." The project's first phase will begin in a handful of states, including Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Indiana, among others. Prices paid in the services sector during December shot higher, casting concern over the path forward for inflation. Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed the prices paid index jumped to a reading of 64.4 in December, up from 58.2 the month prior. Broadly, activity in the sector also increased with the ISM services index rising to 54.1 in December from 53.5 in November. "The surge in the prices paid index to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, from 58.2, is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) quickly moved higher after the release, adding roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back too. Traders now see a less than 50% chance the Fed cuts rates before the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Yesterday, traders saw a roughly 55% chance the Fed will have cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points by the end of its May meeting. Markets sold off as rates chugged higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which opened the day in the green, was down about 1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which had also been positive earlier in the session, fell about 0.4% Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%.

Title: Even Hims & Hers is giving Trump money

Time Published: 2025-01-07T20:25:00Z

The millennial-focused digital health company Hims & Hers (HIMS-1.55%) has donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. It joins the growing ranks of corporate donors to the fund, including Facebook parent company Meta (META+0.94%), Amazon (AMZN-1.46%), OpenAI, Uber (UBER+1.56%), and Bank of America (BAC-2.40%). The donations are viewed by some as an attempt to curry favor with the incoming administration. For instance, on Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan remarked that it’s only natural for Amazon and Meta to seek favorable terms with the Trump administration regarding antitrust cases initiated by the previous administration. Hims & Hers’ donation was first reported by Axios. “At Hims & Hers, we stand with leaders and advocates who are committed to improving America’s broken healthcare system,” the company told Quartz in an emailed statement confirming the donation. “For far too long, this system has forced Americans to struggle – financially and with limited access — to get essential medications and the care they need, especially for stigmatized conditions.” Hims & Hers was founded in 2017, known as just “Hims” at the time, as a platform for men to get prescriptions online for erectile dysfunction and hair loss medications. Since then, it has expanded to offer treatments for men and women to address skin care, anxiety, and overall sexual health. Its stock has surged over 200% in the last 12 months after the company started offering more affordable and off-brand versions of popular weight-loss drugs last year. In May Hims & Hers started offering its customers a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in the diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.47%). Compounding is the process of customizing an approved drug by a state-licensed pharmacist or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. However, drugs that are in shortage, which semaglutide currently is, are not considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. The future of the compounded weight-loss drug market under the Trump administration remains uncertain. Trump has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the FDA. Kennedy has repeatedly been critical of pharmaceutical solutions to obesity. However, his views contrast those of another Trump supporter — Elon Musk. Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been supportive of expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects the rollout of its next-gen Blackwell chips to be the company's biggest revenue driver soon. "We're racing to get Blackwells into every data center in the world," Huang said in an interview with Yahoo Finance from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Huang added that he expects Blackwell revenues to eclipse sales of Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper chips "early this year." Analysts expect Nvidia’s data center business to continue its blockbuster growth thanks to the rollout of its Blackwell lineup. In its most recent quarter, nearly 90% of its revenues came from this segment. The company is currently ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. Fourth quarter revenue at Nvidia tallied $35.1 billion. On Monday, Huang spent much of his CES keynote address talking about the opportunity in robotics and self-driving cars, which he expects will be one of the biggest computing industries in the world. "We've been working on self-driving cars now for some time," Huang said, noting that Nvidia’s technology for autonomous driving is already set to generate $5 billion in annual sales for the AI chipmaker. "If it's already a $5 billion business for us, imagine how big it's going to be when we have 100 million new [self-driving] cars per year,” Huang added. "This is likely going to be one of the largest robotics industries in the world and one of the largest computing industries in the world." On Monday, Huang unveiled the company’s Cosmos platform for developers to simulate their self-driving vehicle software, its latest push into the auto market. The executive also unveiled Nvidia’s partnerships with Toyota (TM) and autonomous trucking company Aurora Innovation (AUR), which will use its specialized chips for self-driving vehicle systems. Its newest DRIVE Thor chip for autonomous driving is based on the architecture for its latest Blackwell AI chips. Aurora stock rose more than 30% following the news on Tuesday. Nvidia stock, which opened at a record high on Tuesday, was down more than 5% in afternoon trade. Nvidia's Automotive and Robotics segments currently make up a relatively small portion of its overall revenue. In Q3, the division brought in $449 million compared to its Data Center business, which brought in $30.8 billion of its $35.1 billion in total revenue. At CES, Nvidia also unveiled a new, pint-sized artificial intelligence superchip called GB10 used in its (also new) client supercomputer. The supercomputer — sized to fit on the average-sized desk — is part of Nvidia’s Project DIGITS announced Monday, advertised to developers, researchers, and students. The device will be available in May for $3,000. "In the case of AI, we started in the cloud," Huang told Yahoo Finance. "We're coming into PCs, into personal computers … we want people to be able to access Nvidia AI, however you like to do it." Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance In explaining the decision, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg nodded to a "cultural tipping point" after Trump's election. Nvidia stock (NVDA) fell Tuesday, reversing direction after a rally fueled by CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. SoftBank billionaire Masayoshi Son has pledged to invest $100 billion in the US over the next four years. Masa's longtime friend and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang weighs in on the pledge. Nvidia announced a host of new software and hardware technologies at CES 2025. Here are the three most important debuts. Nvidia unveiled its latest RTX 50 series of desktop and laptop graphics chips, including the $1,999 RTX 5090. (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. has reached a point where its streaming service can outperform its struggling television offering, according to an analyst who has become the media giant’s biggest bull.Most Read from BloombergNYC’s Subway Violence Deters Drive to Bring Workers Back to OfficeDutch Central Bank Restores Amsterdam’s ‘Ugliest Building’Can American Drivers Learn to Love Roundabouts?Don’t Shrink the BusCan States Hit the Brakes on Runaway Roadbuilding?Redburn Atlantic analyst Hamilton F Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has already been one of the major beneficiaries of this fast-evolving trend, driven by extensive adoption of its AI-optimized chips. In a recent interview with the BG2Pod podcast, Nadella talked about the initial AI boom created by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and Microsoft's efforts to catch up in anticipation of the higher demand for AI services. Nadella was asked about Microsoft's constraints right now and said, "Power yes ... I am not chip supply constrained." The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has taken the stock market by storm. Wall Street is currently fixated on AI agents, which differ slightly from traditional AI copilots. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is well positioned to capitalize on that spending, and the stock price is quite attractive. What companies should consider before making major decisions. Topping the list of 10 stocks is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing — also known as TSMC stock. Two other noteworthy names selected include Vista Energy and Qifu Technology, with one of them multiplying its share price 10 times in three years. TSMC stock jumped 5.5% Monday in heavy volume and reached an all-time high. Sign in to access your portfolio

Nvidia (NVDA) is going all-in on A.I. agents as it seeks to cash in on what CEO Jensen Huang calls a “multi-trillion dollar opportunity” that could change how IT teams operate. During his keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) yesterday (Jan. 6) in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled Nvidia’s Nemotron family of large language models that developers can use to build A.I. agents—autonomous bots that can perform complex tasks without human control.

You can opt out anytime. Built with Meta (META)’s Llama model, the open-sourced Nemotron models, including Nano, Super, and Ultra, allow developers to “create and deploy” A.I. agents they can fine tune to specific business needs, Nvidia said. Applications include customer support, fraud detection, and inventory management optimization. By deploying A.I. agents, companies can “achieve unprecedented productivity,” according to the company. “In the future, these A.I. agents are essentially a digital workforce that are working alongside your employees doing things for you on your behalf,” Huang said during his keynote. “The way you would bring these specialized agents into your company is to onboard them just like you would on-board an employee.” In a live demonstration, Huang showcased examples of A.I. agents with digital replicas of his face. The A.I. research assistant agent for students, for instance, is designed to take documents like lectures, academic journals and financial results and synthesize them into an interactive podcast for “easy learning.” The software security agent can scan software and alert developers if vulnerabilities are detected so they can take immediate action. Other A.I. agents displayed included roles like financial analyst, employee support and factory operations. “The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of A.I. agents in the future,” Huang said. Major companies are already lining up to use Nvidia’s Nemotron models. One early user is the enterprise software giant SAP. Philipp Herzig, chief A.I. officer at SAP, said in a release the company expects “hundreds of millions of enterprise users” to interact with Nvidia’s A.I. agents to “accomplish their goals faster than ever before,” Another enterprise software giant, ServiceNow, will use Nvidia’s new models to “build advanced A.I. agent services” that can solve a complex range of problems in a move to “achieve more with less effort,” Jeremy Barnes, the company’s vice president of platform A.I., said in a release. Nemotron is just one of many products Huang announced during his nearly two-hour-long keynote. The CEO also unveiled a new family of its latest Blackwell chips which the company claims is three times more powerful than previous generations of GPUs. The Blackwell family is expected to create a $100 billion market opportunity for Nvidia, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in a note last November. On top of that, Huang announced the GB200 NVl2, a super chip that it claims will supercharge the capacity for data centers to run A.I. workloads. Nvidia isn’t just betting big on its highly sought-after chips. Huang also announced the Cosmos foundation model to advance physical A.I. like humanoid robots, the DRIVE Hyperion platform to train self-driving vehicles, and Project Digits, a $3,000 personal supercomputer that Nvidia says is 1,000 times more powerful than a typical laptop. Nvidia also announced two autonomous driving partnerships, one with Toyota and the other with Aurora, a self-driving truck startup. The latest A.I. developments cements Nvidia’s position as a global leader in the A.I. revolution. Prior to Huang’s speech, Nvidia’s stock jumped more than 3.4 percent to a record high of $149.43 per share after market close in anticipation of the CES announcements. That surge sent Nvidia’s market value up to $3.47 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s. Nvidia’s market value grew by over $2 trillion last year.

AI to better train robots and cars as well as new gaming chips dominated Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech at the CES 2025 conference on as the world's second most valuable firm expounded upon its potential to expand its business. Nvidia introduced what it calls Cosmos "foundation" models that generate photo-realistic video which can be used to train robots and self-driving cars at a much lower cost than using conventional data. By creating what is known in the tech industry as "synthetic" training data, the models can help robots and cars understand the physical world similar to the way that large language models helped chatbots generate responses in natural language. Users will be able to give Cosmos a text description that can be used to generate video of a world that obeys the laws of physics. This promises to be much cheaper than gathering data as it is done today. To train self-driving cars, for example, companies have fleets of vehicles that roam streets to gather data, and humanoid robots are often trained by having real humans repeat tasks over and over. Huang, however, cautioned that the Cosmos models will need much more data before hitting their "ChatGPT moment". Cosmos will be made available on an "open licence," similar to Meta Platforms Llama3 language models that have become widely used in the tech industry. "We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Lama3 has done for enterprise AI," Huang said. The new gaming chips use Nvidia's 'Blackwell' AI technology to give video games movie-like graphics, especially in a field known as 'shaders,' which can help images like a ceramic teapot look more realistic by adding imperfections and fingerprint smudges to its surface. The new chips also have AI technology to help game developers generate more accurate human faces, an area where players are apt to notice even slightly unrealistic features. The chips, which Nvidia calls its RTX 50 series, will range in price from US$549 to US$1,999, with top models arriving on January 30 and lower-tier models coming in February. Nvidia said its mid-grade US$549 gaming chips will match the company's previous flagship chip, the RTX 4090 which sold for US$1,600. Nvidia also said that Toyota Motor will use its Orin chips and automotive operating system to power advanced driver assistance across several models. It did not give details about the models. Huang expects automotive hardware and software revenue of US$5 billion by February 2026, up from an expected US$4 billion this year. CES 2025, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs January 7-10 in Las Vegas and is used to debut products ranging from new automotive technology to quirky gadgets, as well as showing new ways to use artificial intelligence. Nvidia's stock closed at a record high of US$149.43 on Monday, bringing its valuation to US$3.66 trillion and making it the world's second-most valuable listed company behind Apple.

Title: Nvidia's (NVDA) Conference Fails to Reverse Crypto AI Token Downswing
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/07/ai-tokens-fail-to-mirror-2024s-epic-surge-despite-bullish-nvidia-conference

Full Content:
Artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens are failing to live up to their lofty 2024 goals despite Nvidia's (NVDA) recent conference sparking bullish sentiment among AI stocks in the traditional markets. Last March, the NEAR token doubled in the lead-up to Nividia's annual conference, gains that were mirrored across the wider crypto AI market. Fetch.AI (FET), the graph (GRT) and singularityNET (AGIX) all posted significant rallies to the upside in unison with the conference. This year, however, AI tokens have shown their fragility. NEAR is down by more than 8% in the past 24 hours while FET slumped nearly 9%. NVDA in contrast began the year trading at $133 and rose by 15% to $153 on Monday as the conference began. There are several reasons why AI tokens are no longer getting the attention they once received. One of those is the emergence of AI agent tokens, which share similarities with memecoins due to their volatile nature and cult-like followings. Investors are more inclined to trade these tokens as they have the potential for triple, even quadruple-digit gains compared to regular AI tokens, which are harder to move due to their larger market caps. And just like memecoins, AI agent tokens have more potential for deeper losses as well. Another reason is simply a lack of interest; Google search trend show that searches for "NEAR token" and "Fetch.ai" are down by 47% and 84% respectively since March. The fall from grace is hardly surprising, the crypto market is very fickle and has a habit of punishing sectors that rise rapidly in a speculative nature. Last year's rally was exactly this: people invested in AI tokens as they believed it would be the primary narrative of the crypto bull market, but instead, it was bitcoin that stole the show with 10's of billions dollars of ETF inflows and bullish sentiment around Donald Trump's presidential victory. AI tokens are still in their infancy, however. Few crypto AI projects were used in the mainstream, as many of the products were still being built. Nvidia, meanwhile, announced a $3,000 mini supercomputer called Digits, which will be available to purchase in May. Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.12%) shares tumbled Tuesday morning after rallying the previous day to close at an all-time high. The chipmaker’s shares were down by more than 4% during late morning trading — a reverse after climbing 2.5% at the market open and setting a new intraday all-time high of $153.13. The previous day, Nvidia’s shares climbed more than 3% to reach a record close of $149.43 per share — cents higher than its previous record close of $148.88 in early November. The chipmaker’s shares rallied Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show. Huang announced a suite of artificial intelligence tools for AI agents and updates to the chipmaker’s robotics efforts at the annual Las Vegas trade show Monday night. The chip leader also unveiled its next generation RTX Blackwell GPUs for gaming ranging between $549 and $1,999. To end the keynote, Huang announced Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer that can run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters — more than OpenAI’s GPT-3. The device, which is aimed toward AI researchers and developers, will be available from Nvidia and its partners in May, and starts at $3,000. The chipmaker designed the AI supercomputer with Taiwanese semiconductor company MediaTek. The chip company’s Taiwan-listed shares were up by 4.5% at the market close. Ahead of Huang’s keynote, Bank of America (BAC-2.40%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note, with research analyst Vivek Arya describing CES as “a positive catalyst” for the chipmaker. “[W]hile we don’t doubt NVDA’s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA’s financials,” Arya said about the chipmaker’s robotics strategy. In a note on Tuesday, Bank of America maintained its buy rating on its top pick, and Arya said Huang’s keynote highlighted the chipmaker’s “continued dominance in genAI compute and ecosystem.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trumpy Tech Billionaires Pretty Psyched To #MakeAmericaUnemployedAgain

Throughout most of the last four years, we’ve had an incredibly tight job market, with the unemployment rate frequently dipping lower than at any time over the past five decades. This has made things very difficult for employers who prefer to pay their employees very little money. “No one wants to work anymore!” they cried, as so many of their potential employees went to work for companies willing to pay them a living wage. Now that we are embarking on yet another Trump presidency, some of his wealthiest, techiest supporters are excitedly sharing their ideas for loosening that jobs market up. Elon Musk has been very vocal about how he would like to expand the H-1B visa program because he believes that there are not enough Americans who are smart enough for him to hire. While much of the MAGA riot over this has revolved around the fact that (gently speaking) they do not care for Indian people and non-white immigrants in general and do not want them in our country, there are reasonable criticisms to be made about the way the H-1B visa program used to allow companies to replace fully qualified American workers with foreign workers who will accept less money and have less leverage in negotiations because they can’t just go and switch jobs very easily. As Bernie Sanders noted, “If these jobs are only going to ‘the best and brightest’ [as Musk said], why has Tesla employed H-1B guest workers as associate accountants for as little as $58,000, associate mechanical engineers for as little as $70,000 a year, and associate material planners for as little as $80,000 a year?” It does make one wonder! Musk’s nemesis, OpenAI/ChatGPT guy Sam Altman, is also very excited about replacing American workers — but he wants to replace them with AI. Loving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that! In a recent blog post on his personal site, Altman wrote: We are now confident we know how to build AGI [AI that is smarter than humans are] as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes. Now, people who know way more about this than I do will tell you that no one should listen to a damn thing Altman says, as he is full of shit. Fair! Also, no one needs to be a tech expert to notice that he’s been talking for a month about how ChatGPT is losing money on its $200 a month subscriptions, and how OpenAI just won’t survive unless they are allowed to use copyrighted materials without paying for them — and that he may be hoping that telling potential investors that exciting new anti-labor developments are afoot will lead to a cash infusion. But I have to say, I do think it is somewhat important that a guy who just donated a million dollars to Donald Trump’s inauguration is so very jazzed about replacing workers with AI programs. Will this upset MAGA as much as Musk’s H1B takes? It’s hard to be sure, and would likely depend on whether the robots can trace their lineage back to the Mayflower or not. Of course, the American Right has been very excited about AI and the potential it has to replace creatives like artists, photographers, actors, writers, musicians and what have you. They don’t really care about the job loss there, because people in the creative professions tend to be liberals, and they’re excited because they think AI will allow them to shape popular culture themselves without actually having to develop any talent or skill. They are also frequently quite jazzed about the idea of just being able to have the robots make them their own “personalized” movies and television shows so they won’t accidentally be exposed to ideas (and faces) they don’t like. Those who are most excited about AI tend to believe it will only take the jobs of people they dislike, or jobs that they don’t think should be jobs in the first place. Like the drummer I went on a Tinder date with who was thrilled that AI would allow him to make music and even write songs without having to deal with singers or guitarists. (It did not go well!!) But The Guardian reports, in its article about Altman’s claim, that many companies are hoping to build AI programs to replace workers of all kinds: OpenAI is reportedly planning to launch an AI agent codenamed “Operator” this month, after Microsoft announced its Copilot Studio product and rival Anthropic launched the Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, which can carry out tasks on the computer such as moving a mouse cursor and typing text. McKinsey, for instance, is building an agent to process new client inquiries by carrying out tasks such as scheduling follow-up meetings. The consulting firm has predicted that by 2030, activities accounting for up to 30% of hours worked across the US economy could be automated. Bloomberg reported that Operator will use a computer to take actions on a user’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. Of course, not all of these Trumpy tech guys want to get rid of workers and replace them with AI. Some are doing it the old fashioned way, by just eliminating their jobs entirely. The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world after Musk and fellow giver of $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, is reportedly about to lay off “many dozens” of staffers this week. Bezos could easily pay every Post staff member’s salary out of his own pocket change, so it’s more likely that this is due to wanting to gut the paper and let it die in darkness, or gut the paper and replace all of the current staff with people who would never make a cartoon satirizing his new partnership with Trump. Mark Zuckerberg, too, has recently announced his plans to move content moderation to Texas, where he can get away with paying workers less than in California — likely requiring current workers to move or get laid off, as he has done previously. Donate Just Once! These last two likely seem like good news to the MAGA faithful, but it’s worth noting how very, very casual these fellas and companies are about purging workers. The likelihood that it will only affect the Left and not “Real Americans” like them is pretty much nil. Things just don’t usually work that way. After all, Bezos’s Amazon has already announced coming layoffs in 2025, as have Boeing and Spirit Airlines. But hey! These tech guys and the people who own other companies headed towards major layoffs this year are set to get some major tax cuts — so perhaps the wealth will just trickle down after all. And if not, at least there may be jobs with all those employers who couldn’t find cheap enough workers over the last four years. America first! Thank you for reading Wonkette. This post is public so feel free to share it with everyone you love (or hate). Share Hey these billionaire techbros are going to be fine. Not so much the rest of us. And anything with creativeness is considered "not a real job." And more people unemployed is a good thing for these jerks. And turns out many Americans agree as they voted to have Republicans drive the economy into the ditch. (N.B. it wasn't actually about the economy, just a desire to hurt minorities they don't like.) Are we just going to go along with calling computer programmed response “AI” without any pushback at all? I find it amusing that the people who bitch constantly about automated phone trees and “why can’t I ever talk to an actual person?” are enthusiastic about this bullshit. You thought customer service sucked before? 😂 Anyway…I’ll just be over here yelling about kids these days being on my lawn with droopy pants… No posts Ready for more?

Title: Jeremy Siegel: The 2025 Outlook for Stocks and the Economy

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania The coming year could see tech stocks cooling off and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel predicts. Jeremy Siegel Shankar Parameshwaran The coming year could see a cooling-off of the stock market from the scorching growth of the past two years, especially for tech stocks, and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton emeritus professor of finance Jeremy Siegel said in December on the Wharton Business Daily radio show on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast.) And while businesses are optimistic about deregulation in President-elect Donald Trump’s second term, top concerns in 2025 include how his policies on immigration and tariffs could play out, he added. Following are key takeaways from the interview: Siegel said he expected the stock market to be less upbeat in the coming year. “We’ve had two really fantastic stock market years. They exceeded my expectation this year with another 20% plus gain on top of what we had in 2023,” he said. “I expect it to be more muted [in 2025]. I see [growth in] equities being zero to 10%,” and a correction — a 10% drop — is certainly a possibility, he added. In particular, Siegel saw the possibility of “some cool off” with tech stocks. He noted that even as AI is trending strong, “there seems to be possibilities of more competition and some slowdown in that area” in 2025, he said. Disappointments on AI could be the top dampener for tech stocks, Siegel said. Specifically, the top worries would be around the speed at which AI adoption occurs, and potential competition for market leader Nvidia and its Blackwell chips, and pushback from China, he added. China recently launched a probe into Nvidia, suspecting violations of its anti-monopoly law. “All this is on top of the big uncertainties of President-elect Trump’s tariffs and immigration policy.” Siegel said his median forecast for the stock market is a bit of a slowdown from the pace of the past two years, and not really a bear market. The “standard error” in estimating stock market returns is 20%, which means that in any given year, it could be up 20%, or zero, up 10%, down 10%, or even more extreme than that,” he said. But at the same time, “it is so hard to predict on a one-year [basis],” he added. He noted that although “valuations … for the entire market [are] on the high side, I don’t think they’re crazy.” “Tech firms, [led by the so-called] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon,” he said. “They produced earnings growth of 25% to 30%. But they’re one-third of the market. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” The Magnificent Seven stocks are Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple. If the Magnificent Seven give up some space, “that would give the other 493 stocks [in the S&P 500] a chance to shine, selling at a much more reasonable price earnings ratio of 18 to 20,” Siegel continued. The S&P 500 as a whole is priced at 22 times earnings, which is within the range of equilibrium of around 20, he pointed out. The Federal Reserve on December 18 lowered its funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25%-4.5%, noting positive signs on inflation and unemployment. (Note: This interview with Professor Siegel was conducted before the latest Fed meeting.) “Tech firms, [led by the] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon…. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” — Jeremy Siegel Anticipating that reduction at the Fed’s December meeting, Siegel said that he did not expect another rate cut in January. “My feeling is maybe only a 50 basis points cut next year.” That would put the Fed funds rate at between 3.5%-3.75%, which is “far higher” than the Fed’s own long-term estimate, and higher than its estimate at the September meeting, he added. According to Siegel, the “r star,” or natural rate of interest under 2% inflation is probably between 3.5% and 4%, after taking into account the stimulus to the economy, the deficits, and the uncertainties that loom. The Fed defined the r-star as the real short-term interest rate expected to prevail when an economy is at full strength and inflation is stable. Approaching normalization of the interest rate structure would make room for a “recalibration” of the long-term interest rates, which in non-recessionary times is between 100 and 150 basis points higher than short-term interest rates, Siegel noted. “So, if you can get the Fed funds rate down to 3.5%, we’ll see the 10-year at 4.5% to 5%, or potentially even a little higher.” The 10-year Treasury rate was trending around 4.5% in the third week of December. Small, independent and medium-sized businesses are optimistic about deregulation in Trump’s second term, Siegel said. He pointed to improved sentiment in the latest Small Business Optimism Index put out by the National Federation of Independent Businesses; this sentiment indicator showed its highest reading since June 2021. Recollections of deregulation during Trump’s first term played a role in that sentiment boost, Siegel noted. “People are saying, ‘Hey, you know what? Things were pretty good for those smaller businesses during Trump’s first term.’ And they’re hoping for a repeat in 2025 and 2026.” Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico is one of the biggest uncertainties for U.S. businesses. Trump will start using the threat of tariffs “as a negotiating tool,” Siegel said. “He loves to come in with a very strong position and negotiate down from there,” he said. At the same time, the president-elect has to be aware of the potential consequences of that approach on inflation and on businesses, he cautioned. He listed Trump’s positions on tariffs and immigration as the “two big uncertainties” for the economy. “It would be surprising to me if [Trump] pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” — Jeremy Siegel That said, Trump is unlikely to act in ways that would purposely hurt stock market sentiment, Siegel suggested. “He is the most outspokenly pro-stock market President we have ever had,” and one who measures his success as a president on how well the stock market does, he added. “It would be surprising to me if he pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” Geopolitical concerns weigh heavily on the outlook for 2025, ranging from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and around China on multiple fronts. Trump could help ease some of those pressures with his promises of entering into negotiations on Ukraine and the Gaza Strip immediately after taking office, Siegel said. “With what has happened in Syria, it might make the time right for a deal on both those fronts,” he added. “That would take out a lot of uncertainty. It’s far from a done deal, and things could spiral out of control. The markets, by continuing to be strong, are actually hoping for settlements in those two troubled areas.” On the ongoing threat potential of China acting against Taiwan, Trump might try to get together with Xi Jinping, “but that is also very, very uncertain,” Siegel said. “Fortunately, we don’t have a shooting war in Asia yet.” One of the top worries in 2025 will be around cybersecurity, especially from state-sponsored bad actors, Siegel said. “I wouldn’t like to wake up in the morning and try to get access to my bank accounts and brokerage accounts and find they’re all locked out.” That worry is “a nationwide phenomenon that could throw the world into chaos,” he added. According to Siegel, the government ought “to consider cybersecurity as important as our military preparedness and spend a lot of resources to make sure that’s there.” Securing the electricity grids is another priority, he said, noting that the emerging AI sector has high power requirements. “Those are two areas where we certainly need to spend resources if we are to realize the potential gains from artificial intelligence.” A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania ©2025 Knowledge at Wharton.

The Jeff Bezos-owned paper cuts about 4% of its workforce, with members of its advertising, marketing and information technology teams affected UPDATE: A Washington Post rep told TheWrap no members of its information technology team lost their jobs as part of the cuts, as The New York Times reported. The Washington Post is laying off roughly 100 employees — or about 4% of its workforce — the Jeff Bezos-owned outlet disclosed on Tuesday. The job cuts will affect the business side of the paper, not its newsroom, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future,” WaPo said in a statement shared with WSJ. WaPo’s cuts will affect members of its advertising, marketing and information technology teams, according to The New York Times. The paper was hit with 240 job cuts in October 2023. The Washington Post is eliminating just under 100 roles on the business side. Newsroom not impacted at this time. Post statement: “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future.” The Post’s latest job cuts come after 2024 was a brutal year for the media industry in terms of layoffs. In 2024, nearly 15,000 jobs were eliminated across broadcast, television, film, news and streaming — extending a two-year run in which the news and entertainment businesses were dealt body blows. WaPo’s cuts also come a month after Bezos said the outlet made the “right decision” to not endorse a candidate during the 2024 U.S. election. The Amazon founder spearheaded the decision to not have WaPo’s editorial board endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump — marking the first time in 36 years the paper didn’t endorse a presidential candidate. If The Post were to endorse Harris, Bezos noted that the “plusses were small” and that it would add to a “perception of bias.” Their non-endorsement of Harris was skewered by many media reporters and readers, with former executive editor Marty Baron calling it “cowardice.”

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains as cautious investors weighed new economic data in the midst of Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell around 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.1%. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI indicated the manufacturing sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," wrote Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Less hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from the 2.1% seen in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. In corporates, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall around 5% after hitting a record high close. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Despite Nvidia's declines, other chip stocks extended their rally, with Micron Technology (MU) up about 4% and Asia names making gains. Meanwhile, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Title: The Market Survived The Holidays. Now What?

By Greg Guenthner Posted January 7, 2025 We waited (and waited) for stocks to find a bottom and recover during the December slide. Then, we crossed our fingers for a low-volume melt up in that magical window between Christmas and New Year’s Day. But nothing happened. Santa was a no-show over our little holiday break. We were instead hit with wave after wave of selling as speculators ditched their broken trades and pouted about the lumps of coal filling the pages of their brokerage accounts. Perhaps I suffer from a fair amount of stock market PTSD, because the failed December rally prompted flashbacks of late 2021. If you have a short memory, this was exactly when the market started to show serious signs of cracking lower, which it promptly did as the final stalwart stocks broke through support in January 2022, dragging investors into a grinding bear market that lasted almost the entire calendar year. Fortunately for the bulls, the market stabilized when the calendar flipped to January. So it’s a bit premature to begin leaning on any bearish calls. Not yet, anyway. Today, we’ll dig into what’s ailing this market. I’ll explain what I think is going on since the melt-up stalled in early December, where stocks might be headed in 2025, and the tickers you need to watch to keep up with the snapback moves that are brewing this week. First up: let’s talk about the Santa Rally phenomenon. Technically, the Santa Claus Rally is a period of unusual market strength falling on the final five trading days of the year, and finishing up on the second trading day of the new year. No, stock’s don’t have to go up during this low-volume period. But they tend to do just that as investors and traders “get ahead” of the best plays of the next calendar year. Here’s the thing… When it comes to these little seasonal quirks, we tend to gain more information when they fail to materialize. Everyone was watching and waiting for choice holiday trading conditions. When the big man didn’t show (and stocks continued to drop), speculators started to get worried. Is the market completely broken after Santa failed to show? Not quite! Here’s my best guess to explain what’s going on: First, Trump’s victory emboldened the bulls and pulled much of what would have been the December melt-up gains ahead by about a month. November featured a massive crypto breakout and a stock market run that featured some bubbly groups extending higher. I think it’s fair to say that the market became way too frothy by the time December rolled around. That’s when market breadth began to deteriorate. Fewer and fewer stocks were moving higher, and we once again found ourselves in a market propped up by the mega-caps as crypto pulled back, many of the snapback tech-growth names cooled, and investors started to get more defensive. Yes, there’s still plenty of froth out there. But the market’s sluggish holiday performance caused some ugly numbers to creep into the picture. For starters, the percentage of stocks outperforming the S&P hit an all-time low over the holiday break, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This adds even more fuel to the arguments about a few big stocks propping up the rest of the market… Next, we witnessed a handful of failed breakouts – small-caps, biotechs, and many of the popular growth stocks are the most prominent names that ripped above resistance, only to get yanked right back down once the market softened. Then there are some not-so-bullish seasonality patterns emerging. Now that it’s January, we’re entering a bit of a soft spot for the market. One of the worst quarters during the four-year Presidential Cycle starts now, Carson Research’s Ryan Detrick reminds us. In year one of the presidential cycle, Q1 is the weakest. The Stock Trader’s Almanac also says that a failed Santa rally can precede bear markets, or at the very least time where stocks can be found at lower prices later in the year. While I don’t think the sky is falling, I do believe we should do our best to keep our heads on straight as we dive deeper into the first quarter. Trading conditions could get more difficult by February. Perhaps we see new highs in the averages, followed by some chop and then the beginning of that elusive 10% pullback that the market has managed to avoid (the last one ended in Oct. 2023). Are conditions about to get a lot more difficult over the next three months? This question continues to run through my mind as stocks continue to recover this week. For now, we’ll see if some of these fresh 2025 bounces stick. If the market continues to recover from here, we might enjoy a little pre-earnings season rally for a couple of weeks. While I’m staying tactically long here, I’m still on alert for any evidence that supports a weakening market. If I do start to see these cracks widen, it will be time to look for some downside plays. Here’s what you should be watching this week to help cut through the noise: Semiconductors: The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is beginning to break out of a six-month consolidation this week. It’s hard to be bearish if the chip stocks are back on top, and NVIDIA Inc. (NVDA) is back to teasing all-time highs following Monday’s 3.4% rally. Tech-growth: Many of the tech snapback trades fell flat over the holidays. But our tech-hype proxy ARK Innovation (ARKK) is working to get back on track after just barely kissing its 50-day moving average. If these “growthier” tech names can make another run, the market’s likely repairing our late December breadth worries… Crypto: The air came out of Bitcoin just before the holidays as the flagship crypto fell from a high of $108K all the way down into the low 90K range, revisiting support from late November. But crypto started perking up again late last week, and Bitcoin was able to sneak back above the magical $100K level to kick off the trading week. Bitcoin (and the rest of the crypto space) did exactly what the bulls needed. It established a floor without eating too much into its early November rally. It’s safe to assume that with crypto moving higher to kick off 2025, there’s still plenty of speculative firepower left out there. Bottom line: If these charts continue to look healthy, there’s no need to get too bearish over shorter time frames. But if we do see market conditions deteriorate, we’ll discuss ways to prepare (and profit!) in the days and weeks ahead.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains as cautious investors weighed new jobs data in the midst of Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell around 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) remained the only index in the green, up about 0.2%. An update on JOLTS job openings in November showed openings rose more than expected. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 8.1 million jobs open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million seen in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from the 2.1% seen in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million seen in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation. In corporates, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 4% after hitting a record high close. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Despite Nvidia's declines, other chip stocks extended their rally, with Micron Technology (MU) up about 4% and Asia names making gains. Meanwhile, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Micron Technologies (MU) is climbing for a second straight day after Nvidia (NVDA) noted that it was using MU's chips in its new products. After advancing 10.5% yesterday, the shares are climbing 6% today. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reported yesterday that Micron's high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) chips were being incorporated into NVDA's new GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell gaming chips. 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors Considered a key component of AI, HBM has been an important growth engine for Micron. During the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call, held on Dec. 18, Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana noted that HBM, combined with SSD chips, had enabled the company's revenue from data centers to soar 400% versus the same period a year earlier during the quarter. Adding that HBM had become a multiple billion-dollar business, Sadana noted that more than half of the company's revenue was being generated by data centers. Foxconn's Strong Results and Micron's Presence on Evercore's List MU stock was also likely lifted yesterday by the slightly stronger-than-expected Q4 results reported by electronics maker Foxconn. The largest manufacturer of Apple's (AAPL) iPhones, Taiwan-based Foxconn reported Q4 sales of 2.13 trillion New Taiwan dollars or $65 billion. Analysts had expected the company’s revenue to come in at 2.1 trillion New Taiwan dollars, according to an average compiled by LSEG SmartEstimate. Micron sells chips to Apple. Also yesterday, Micron was included on a list of stocks called “AI Enablers, Adopters and Adapters.” Compiled by investment bank Evercore ISI, the list includes members of the Russell 3000 index whose market caps are above $3 billion and whose previous earnings calls include more references to AI than average for Russell 2000 members in the previous four quarters. Additionally, the stocks on the had to have had a positive reaction to their earnings, while their forward P/E ratios trade below their five-year average. Finally, Evercore ISI predicts that the earnings per share of all of the names on the list will increase by at least 9.6%. While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta’s Free Speech Grift

When you buy through links on kottke.org, I may earn an affiliate commission. Thanks for supporting the site! kottke.org. home of fine hypertext products since 1998. 🍔 💀 📸 😭 🕳️ 🤠 🎬 🥔 From The Verge: Meta abandons fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in favor of Community Notes. Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are ditching third-party fact-checkers in favor of a Community Notes program inspired by X, according to an announcement penned by Meta’s new Trump-friendly policy chief Joel Kaplan. Meta is also moving its trust and safety teams from California to Texas. Here is Mark Zuckerberg’s thread about the announcement: It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression and giving people voice on our platforms. Here’s what we’re going to do: 1/ Replace fact-checkers with Community Notes, starting in the US. 2/ Simplify our content policies and remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are out of touch with mainstream discourse. 3/ Change how we enforce our policies to remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations and requiring higher confidence for our filters to take action. 4/ Bring back civic content. We’re getting feedback that people want to see this content again, so we’ll phase it back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. 5/ Move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US content review to Texas. This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content. 6/ Work with President Trump to push back against foreign governments going after American companies to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world and the best way to defend against the trend of government overreach on censorship is with the support of the US government. It’ll take time to get this all right and these are complex systems so they’ll never be perfect. But this is an important step forward and I’m looking forward to this next chapter! I wildly underestimated how quickly the big media and social media companies were going to kowtow to the incoming president. From The NY Times: Meta’s move is likely to please the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump and its conservative allies, many of whom have disliked Meta’s practice of adding disclaimers or warnings to questionable or false posts. Mr. Trump has long railed against Mr. Zuckerberg, claiming the fact-checking feature treated posts by conservative users unfairly. Since Mr. Trump won a second term in November, Meta has moved swiftly to try to repair the strained relationships he and his company have with conservatives. Mr. Zuckerberg noted that “recent elections” felt like a “cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.” In late November, Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where he also met with his secretary of state pick, Marco Rubio. Meta donated $1 million to support Mr. Trump’s inauguration in December. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg elevated Mr. Kaplan, a longtime conservative and the highest-ranking Meta executive closest to the Republican Party, to the company’s most senior policy role. And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, would join Meta’s board. BTW, Dana White, a violent man who assaulted his wife, got a warm welcome to Meta’s board from Instagram/Threads chief Adam Mosseri: “Excited to have you on board!” Everyone is falling in line. And all those $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund from tech & media companies and CEOs are nothing but racket protection payments. I don’t think this actually has a whole lot to do with Zuckerberg’s or Meta’s commitment to free speech. What Zuckerberg and Meta have realized is the value, demonstrated by Trump, Musk, and MAGA antagonists, of saying that you’re “protecting free speech” and using it as cover for almost anything you want to do. For Meta, that means increasing engagement, decreasing government oversight and interference, and lowering their labor costs (through cutting their workforce and strengthening their bargaining position vs labor) — all things that will make their stock price go up and increase the wealth of their shareholders. Decreasing moderation and allowing more political & hate speech (I don’t now how else to read “remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations” — hate speech is protected speech in the US) will increase engagement overall, any AI bots they want to unleash to spur engagement don’t have to be moderated, TX is more labor- and corporate-friendly than CA (I’m sure this is also part of Meta’ ongoing negotiation with CA about letting them have more leeway or they’ll leave the state), and I think the benefit of rethinking their rules to be more friendly to conservatives is self-explanatory. Sort by: thread — thread . latest . faves now that authoritarian bullies are in charge, Zuck can get rid of the pretense he cares about race-baiting right wing propaganda and hate speech online, and fully pursue mindless engagement chasing under the pretense he's just super interested in free speech and fighting "censorship" The key thing to understand about Meta without guard rails is that, when they allowed their platform to exist without any content controls in Myanmar under an extremist leader, it was used to directly enable a genocide. Zuckerberg knows that its level of threat. https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/asia-and-the-pacific/south-east-asia-and-the-pacific/myanmar/report-myanmar/ Facebook suppressed promotion of political content during a Democratic administration and is restoring it for a Republican one https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5muzv3wk2g Let’s be clear—the fact checkers have not “been” politically biased as Zuck suggests, but have been *perceived as such* because of politically motivated efforts to smear them, one that Zuck is now participating in and capitulating to. 1/ https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5mthm5m22g This is one of those unstated subtexts that everyone acts on without acknowledging it explicitly, that "free speech" simply applies to being able to conservatives being able to say nasty things about people without those people being able to respond https://bsky.app/profile/owillis.bsky.social/post/3lf5o4bz3g22p Fact-checking wasn’t “biased” against conservatives. Conservatives just shared more false content. If there’s a sportsball game and one team fouls four times as much, it’s not “biased” for the ref to call four times as many fouls against that team. https://bsky.app/profile/dgrand.bsky.social/post/3lf5tbabslk2x NEW: On the same day Mark Zuckerberg announces Meta's new commitment to "Free Expression," internal employee dissent and criticism is being censored https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/ Reporter: Meta announced they will stop doing fact checks.. Trump: I think they’ve come a long way Reporter: Do you think he’s responding to the threats you’ve made in the past Trump: Probably Meta is facing an antitrust trial in April. The company has lots of other business before the U.S. government. And Trump once threatened to send Zuckerberg to jail. That's just some of the background for today's big Meta changes. There's more in this AM's Reliable Sources newsletter: https://cnn.it/3C7tFDp NEW: Meta changed its Community Guidelines today to permit "allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality" @knibbs.bsky.social https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/ I talked to 10 current and former Meta employees about the company's surrender to the right on speech issues. All were upset. One person called the changes "a precursor to genocide" https://www.platformer.news/meta-fact-checking-free-speech-surrender/ https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:jg7zvku4khzmvyjwbzv4lnly/bafkreigm3en2wq6ei3roervmdz7hkpyqo7k2o23hx5pqw5uqb7r5r66klm@jpeg Meta has repeatedly deleted our articles, including ones about Instagram's censorship and disproportionate moderation against trans people. It put a "fact check" warning on an article we did about hurricane helene AI spam proliferating on the platform https://www.404media.co/facebook-is-censoring-404-media-stories-about-facebooks-censorship/ NEW: I've obtained internal Meta docs revealing an array of sample posts that are now allowed under new hate speech rules. Examples include calling children "trannies," “Jews are flat out greedier than Christians," and “immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of shit” https://theintercept.com/2025/01/09/facebook-instagram-meta-hate-speech-content-moderation/ Hello!

Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Updated, Jan. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include numbers from Nvidia's full day of trading. On January 6, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show made a series of what looked to me like relatively small announcements — including products for industries such as robotics, cars, and gaming, according to the Wall Street Journal. Are these mini-announcements a diversion? One analyst thinks the biggest news could be Nvidia’s strategy to compete with cloud services customers — Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet — by building its own AI cloud, noted Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia — whose shares rose almost 4% in pre-market trading and closed down 9.3% by the end of January 7 — is excited about the opportunity to provide software for robotics developers. "The ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming,” Huang told CES attendees, according to IBD. "Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own. We created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer," he added. An Nvidia spokesperson I contacted declined to comment. If there is one thing I learned in writing my latest book, Brain Rush, it is this: Nvidia’s future depends heavily on collaboration with companies closer to technology end-users. That’s because Nvidia — which designs chips and builds software for developers — can only enjoy rapid growth by motivating companies closer to end-users — such as chip fabricators, cloud services providers, enterprise software companies, and management consultants — to make Nvidia’s products part of a system that businesses and consumers find valuable. Nvidia’s CES product announcements are aimed at strengthening such partnerships. Here are the industries these announcements aim to enhance: While Nvidia did not make an announcement about this at CES, the biggest news from the company could be a strategy to compete with its cloud services customers who account for most of Nvidia’s growth. Indeed one analyst detected Nvidia’s growing appetite for leased data center capacity equipped for AI processing. Such AI data centers would “rent out servers powered by its own chips as well as host its AI software development platform,” noted Investor’s Business Daily. The analyst sees Nvidia’s push into cloud computing as a New Year’s surprise. “We see the potential for Nvidia to accelerate its data center leasing in 2025 as it looks to procure more capacity that can be used for its 'AI cloud,' with the potential for Nvidia to outpace its hyperscale peers in data center leasing in 2025,” noted TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias in a report featured by IBD. In addition to looking for more data center capacity in other deals, Elias noted an “apparent large leasing deal between Nvidia and Digital Realty for data center capacity in Northern Virginia,” IBD reported. Nvidia’s AI Cloud would compete with so-called Neoclouds — AI processing cloud services from the likes of CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, Vultr and Together AI, noted IBD — as well as Nvidia’s biggest AI chip customers Amazon and Microsoft, wrote Elias. By building its own neocloud, Nvidia could take more profit from a fast-growing industry sector. Nvidia — which now distributes its AI software by leasing it through AWS — could boost its profits by operating its own cloud. AI neoclouds are expected to grow at a 100% compound annual rate from $4 billion last year to $32 billion by 2027, according to Pitchbook. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s cloud customers are trying to buy more AI chips from rivals and build their own custom chips. For example, in addition to buying Blackwell chips from Nvidia, hyperscalers are buying AI processors from Broadcom and Marvell Technologies as well as designing their own custom AI accelerators and trying to sell them to OpenAI, Apple and Meta Platforms, IBD reported. Nvidia stock may be heading up. Based on 40 Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets, Nvidia stock would need to rise 18.5% to reach the average forecast of $135 per share, noted TipRanks. Here are comments from less- and more-bullish analysts: To me the key questions for investors are: How much revenue could Nvidia's AI cloud generate? Will Nvidia’s hyperscaler clients buy less from Nvidia? My guess is Huang expects Nvidia’s AI cloud service will make the company better off. One Community. Many Voices.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. By all accounts, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang managed to deliver on elevated expectations during his CES keynote address, one that Wedbush's Dan Ives describes as imbued with more of "a rock concert vibe than a tech CEO speech." However, the address did not satiate the ravenous appetites of all listeners, as per the latest commentary from the investment banking firm Benchmark. $NVDA Buy Following CES - Benchmark While Jensen Huang, as expected delivered a broad master-class on the current state and direction of the AI industry, and made several technically interesting announcements that together further extend the company’s hardware and software… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) January 7, 2025 To wit, while conceding that NVIDIA's Jensen Huang "delivered a broad master-class on the current state and direction of the AI industry, and made several technically interesting announcements," Benchmark believes that "many investors were hoping for more concrete progress updates on the ramp of Blackwell and some input as to the company’s progress with its next generation GPU platform, Rubin." Benchmark did take pains to highlight Huang's declaration that NVIDIA's latest Blackwell platform was in full production phase now, but asserted that most of the content of the keynote address was "already well understood by the market and again there was zero mention of Rubin, although to be fair, this next-generation design is not expected until 2026." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Huang touched on the following points in his CES keynote address on Monday (the list also includes several material developments that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the address): Coming back, Benchmark does feel that, on the whole, Huang's keynote address provided "a strong kick-off to this year’s CES." The firm, therefore, reiterated its 'Buy' rating for NVIDIA shares, replete with a $190 stock price target, which implies a 25 percent upside potential relative to the current price level.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Ramps Up Production in Japan, US, and Germany to Diversify Away from China

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is all set for full-capacity production in the U.S. and Germany after commercializing its debut Japanese chip plant in Kikuyo, Kumamoto Prefecture, last December. Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) $3 trillion valuation and Taiwan Semiconductor’s 2nm progress testify to AI-driven chip industry growth. Reportedly, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) eyes $80 billion in developing AI data centers in fiscal 2025, marking a big win for the sector. Also Read: Taiwan Semiconductor’s Kaohsiung Expansion To Boost 2-nm Chip Production The contract chipmaker aims to complete production of plants in Arizona in 2025 and Dresden in 2027. Construction of Taiwan Semiconductor’s second Japanese factory will likely begin near the Kikuyo plant, the Japan News reports. Taiwan commanded 67% of the global market share in contracted semiconductor manufacturing and nearly 80% in cutting-edge products in 2023, the Japan News cites TrendForce. Taiwan attempted to shield itself from geopolitical tension by concentrating production on the island. Still, it also remains focused on its geographical diversification to help the world boost its semiconductor base by reducing its dependence on China, whose semiconductor supply chain was disrupted during the 2020 pandemic. Kumamoto Gov. Takashi Kimura shared with Japan Times the country’s hopes to attract Taiwan Semiconductor’s third plant in the prefecture. The new plant, located in Kikuyo, began commercializing 12-28 nm technology last December. It caters to Sony Group Corp (NYSE:SONY), which produces camera sensors for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Taiwan Semiconductor is proficient in making general-purpose chips between 12 and 28 nm. However, chip plants in Japan failed to produce semiconductors thinner than 40 nm, prompting them to tap the Taiwanese chipmaker. Taiwan Semiconductor is building a new plant in Arizona, where commercialization of 4-nm chips will likely begin between January and March. It aims to complete its debut European plant in Dresden in 2027. The plant targets a quadrupolar production plan with principal plants in Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., and Germany. Meanwhile, some concerns loom in the form of President-elect Donald Trump taking charge on January 20. The U.S. posted a significant trade deficit with Taiwan in 2023, prompting Trump to verbally attack the country during his presidential campaigns for allegedly depriving the U.S. of the semiconductor industry. He suggested redemption by slapping tariffs on Taiwan, which can increase the contract chipmaker’s production costs since labor costs in the U.S. are about 30% higher than in Taiwan. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 115% in the last 12 months. Goldman Sachs‘ Bruce Lu projected another year of robust revenue growth for Taiwan Semiconductor in 2025E, 26.8%, following 29.4% revenue growth in 2024E (all in USD terms). Demand in leading-edge nodes, mainly supported by AI, backed this growth. Investors can gain exposure to companies that manufacture semiconductors through ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG) and ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:XSD).

Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang have jointly grown $28 billion richer in just the first three trading days of this year, meaning they're worth $350 billion combined — more than Bank of America. The Meta CEO has gained about $15 billion this year, while the Nvidia CEO's wealth has risen by about $13 billion. Their flying start has made them the biggest wealth gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index so far in 2025, but other big names in tech aren't far behind. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was up about $12 billion at Monday's close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with an $8 billion increase, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, up about $6 billion each. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was next on the list at $5 billion in the green. Zuckerberg and Huang's combined gain of $28 billion accounts for nearly half of the net $61 billion increase for the world's 20 richest people in 2025. The pair's wealth jump reflects a nearly 8% advance in Meta stock and an 11% rise for Nvidia this year. Meta shares benefited from Wall Street analysts raising their price targets. Nvidia climbed on signs of strong demand for microchips and anticipation for Huang's keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday. The Nvidia chief revealed new chips and a $3,000 AI supercomputer named Digits. He also announced partnerships in robotics, self-driving cars, and more independent or "agentic" AI. Zuckerberg and Huang's personal fortunes grew by about $79 billion and $70 billion respectively last year, trailing only Elon Musk's $203 billion gain by Bloomberg's estimates. The world's 20 richest people grew a combined $702 billion wealthier last year, lifting their net worth to above $3 trillion — a figure that rivals Microsoft's market value of $3.2 trillion. Tech leaders including Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have surged in recent years, supercharging the wealth of their biggest shareholders, as investors bet they'll play pivotal roles in the AI revolution and capture a big chunk of the profits generated.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Price Levels as Stock Continues Rising After CEO's Keynote Speech

Shares in artificial Intelligence (AI) favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will remain in the spotlight on Tuesday after CEO Jensen Huang provided several important technology updates last night during his keynote address at the CES 2025 conference in Las Vegas. During the highly anticipated event, Huang unveiled next generation AI-powered gaming chips, introduced technology that speeds up the training of robots, launched the chipmaker’s first desktop computer and announced a deal with Japanese automaker, Toyota (TM). Nvidia is coming off another banner year during which insatiable demand for AI infrastructure helped drive its stock price up about 170%. Those gains followed a more than three-fold increase in 2023. Nvidia shares, which hit a record closing high of $149.43 on Monday, were up another 2.5% in recent premarket trading and poised to hit an all-time intraday high today. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching as investors react to Huang’s CES update. Nvidia shares broke out above the top trendline of a descending channel on Friday, with bullish momentum continuing into Monday’s trading session ahead of Huang’s presentation. While the stock set a record closing high yesterday, the price closed significantly below its intraday peak to form a shooting star, a candlestick pattern that can signal a potential reversal. Looking ahead, investors should watch for increasing trading volume, which would signal conviction behind recent buying. Although share turnover registered its highest level in more than a week on Monday, it remains below longer-term averages, suggesting that larger market participants remain on the sidelines. Let’s identify several key overhead areas to watch on Nvidia's chart and also point out two major support levels that may come into focus during retracements. The first immediate overhead area to watch sits around $150. While the price has traded above this key level on multiple occasion since early November, it has failed to decisively close above it. To project a potential price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), we can use the bars pattern tool. This works by extracting the uptrend from April to June last year and repositioning it from last month’s low. Such analysis forecasts a target of around $225, about 50% above Monday’s closing price. We selected the prior trend because it began from the lower trendline of an earlier descending channel on the chart, closely replicating how the current move higher has started. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch the $140 level. Those who prefer not to chase breakouts may look for entry points in this area near the descending channel’s top trendline, which also closely aligns with the stock’s prominent June peak. Finally, the bulls’ inability to defend this area could see Nvidia shares retrace to around $130, a location on the chart where the may find support near the August swing high and December swing low.

Title: Vets lodge members in multi-state feud with hotel chain, AZ cops over crank call & judicial error

January 07, 2025 07:30 ET | Source: Veterans Recovery Network Inc. Veterans Recovery Network Inc. PHOENIX, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An African American man on the ASD spectrum working at Veterans Recovery Network, a veteran services organization for homeless military veterans, has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Nevada District against The Siegel Select Group, a national property management firm previously investigated by members of Congress for unlawful evictions, and city law enforcement officials at the Casa Grande Police Department for allegedly running unlawful evictions, recklessly interfering with active protection orders issued by an Arizona judge, wanton eviction procedures, and submitting falsified police report information about a physical assault on a Casa Grande woman last February while he was nearly 700 miles away, as court documents infer to evince the cumulative effects involved in this situation. Cary Peterson, who works at a non-governmental organization that supports disabled and homeless military veterans, filed a civil lawsuit against the Siegel Select Group, and local police officers for unlawful eviction and civil rights violation claims. The lawsuit alleges that Siegel Group's management in Arizona interfered with a court order of protection, locked Peterson out of his unit, violated statutory laws on due process rights to tenants, and had been involved in a monetary dispute over a holiday rental property funded by Veterans Recovery Network. Arizona Senator T.J. Shope, a member of the 16th Legislature District, expressed disinterest in the 'undesired lobbying contact' email concerning this legal situation in his backyard involving ASD-disabled Black-Hispanic man and his son who were initially visited with threats of physical harm and racial harassment with death threats prior to filing a lawsuit for a order of restraint, according to Mesa Police Department records and the criminal prosecution that remains pending in the court, and a matter of the public interest at the Arizona Attorney General’s office. Shope, a member of the Arizona legislative committee on public safety, is a member of the 16th Legislature District, which includes Casa Grande and Pinal County. OLD BEEFS In the Summer of 2024, the Veterans Recovery Network had been working with a disabled military veteran in Mesa with his VA benefits. PACT Act Relief Settlement Program advocated administrative complaints filed with the Office of Civil Rights and the Arizona Attorney General when they became aware of the landlord-clients of Hull, Holiday & Holiday Law Office for evictions against members of their veterans organization. These eviction actions all resulted from disabled tenants living on SSDI or VA disability benefits being placed into an housing-assistance programs run by state-mandated nonprofit organizations that were required to pay the majority or all of the disabled tenants’ rent payments. But eviction actions started instead after these community-bridging organizations failed to do so after several months (without the tenant's knowledge). NEW BEEFS December 18, 2024, Siegel Select Group filed a crossover lawsuit against Peterson in the Casa Grande Justice concerning the Arizona rental property controversies raised in Peterson federal lawsuit filed against Siegel’s corporate office and property manager two weeks earlier. Peterson’s federal complaint against Siegel Select Group Nevada, Siegel's Arizona property manager Rebecca Blanford and an unidentified male with her, and police officials in the City of Casa Grande, was followed by Casa Grande Justice Court Justice of Peace John Ellsworth, a military veteran who’s judiciary profile (https://www.pinalcourtsaz.gov/directory.aspx?eid=32) quote reads that ‘all persons should be held accountable for their actions,’ entered a court hearing disposition (an eviction judgment in favor of Siegel) that the respondent, Cary Peterson- ironically being a (retired) Tribal court judge from Silicon Valley- 'failed to appear' in court on December 23, 2024, resulting in a default judgment against him. This 'absentia' judgment erroneously entered by the court occurred despite Peterson typing his name into the Zoom conference of the court hearing, stating that he was 'present' before the court sessions began, which included communication on the official court record with Siegel's attorney and Judge Ellsworth. The court record shows that Peterson filed an appeal with an application order receipt for a 'supersedeas bond' in accordance with the Arizona law before the Pinal County Constable got involved to reclaim the rental property in dispute last week. The same Arizona justice court that stated Peterson 'failed to appear' for the eviction hearing [as well] denied Peterson’s notice of appeal, and supplemental motions requesting the court transcript and ‘designation of record on appeal.’ CONGRESSIONAL FAULT-FINDING In 2021, U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn was the vanguard of a congressional committee report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) against Siegel Select Group. In July 2022, Congressman Clyburn published a report that condemned the Siegel Group for unlawful evictions and civil rights violations of several tenants during the pinnacle of the COVID crisis, their 'misleading' and 'aggressive' tactics to evict tenants "uniquely egregious." According to the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, chaired by Rep. James E. Clyburn, this federal legislative report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) revealed that Siegel Select Group used abusive tactics to 'evict tens of thousands of struggling residents' despite the current eviction laws during the COVID pandemic, while receiving $2 million in forgiven Paycheck Protection Program funds (PPP government loans). EVIDENT ERRORS The (erroneously-issued) 'failure to appear' judicial order is [now] a multi-jurisdictional controversy that now remains a matter of the United States District Court (Peterson v. Siegel Group Nevada Inc., et al., No. Case No. 2:24-cv-02265 (D. Nev. Dec. 6, 2024) derived from more than a handful of related lawsuits between Peterson, a veteran client of Veteran Recovery Recovery Network ('Sternberg'), the Siegel Group, particular Siegel Select Group employees ('Blanford'), Casa Grande City's police officer Timothy Dunham, three unidentified Casa Grande police officials, and the Law Offices of Hull, Holiday & Holiday- a complex legal matter which public records show had a domino-effect of cumulative errors after a simple misinterpretation caused by what Peterson says was a 'crank call' made to the police by an estranged relative in Arizona last February, while Peterson was several hundreds of miles away in California. The erroneous police reporting by the Casa Grande Police Department was followed by irregularities in the Arizona justice system that resulted in the Arizona state court’s communications director telling the Arizona State Bar’s communications director and a news investigator in an email response that he could not find any trace of newly-appointed Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Lisa Boddington’s family court docket cases involving Peterson as a party. Last September, in another instance related to Commissioner Boddington’s judicial case load, the judge’s deputy clerk concedes to the court transcriber that the audio recordings from [all three] court hearings related to Peterson’s protection order actions were lost due to ‘human error.’ Court papers disclose that Peterson believes that the erroneous police report information filed by the Casa Grande Police caused the Arizona judges and local community to place him in a bad light, defaming his character and reputation in general. STATUS OF PROCEEDINGS Last Friday, Peterson filed an emergency motion to transfer this case matter to the United States District Court for the Arizona District due to the fact that Nevada does not have jurisdiction to hear civil rights claims against local law enforcement officials under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States of Code. These court proceedings, assigned to United States District Court Chief Judge Andrew P. Gordon of the Nevada District, remain pending. There are no scheduled hearings at the present time. ﻿News Content By: David De Livera, Alena Moskowitz-Hardley (freelance writers) A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/38cf3fd6-0a61-4eb3-9d4d-ad4595978120

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures held steady on Tuesday as cautious investors weighed Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans and puzzled over tariff prospects, with fresh jobs data on deck. Contracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) were up 0.1%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) inched higher by 0.2%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) hovered around the flatline. Buzz around Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote is providing a bright spot for markets used to moving tentatively amid uncertainty around policy from the incoming Trump administration. Shares in Nvidia rose over 2% in pre-market, coming off hitting a record high close, after Huang revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Chip stocks extended their rally in its wake, with Micron Technology (MU) up over 5% and Asia names making gains. At the same time, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. The dollar (DX-Y.NYB) continued to come under pressure, having sunk to one-week lows. An update on JOLTS job openings in November later in the day will feed into the debate over the path of interest rates, as well as setting the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation. A reading on US services activity is also on the docket. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Everything that happened at The Game Awards 2024: Winners, Game of the Year, and every new trailer

All the news from The Game Awards 2024 in one place, reported as it happened. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Like the last several years before it, 2024 has been a year chock-full of exciting game releases and innovative new hits. Now that it's drawing to a close, it's time to commemorate all of those great new titles with The Game Awards 2024. Geoff Keighley once again hosted the annual awards show in Los Angeles' Peacock Theater, and this year's iteration is particularly celebratory since it was the event's 10th anniversary. The gala kicked off on Thursday, December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. Once the show began, the winners of all 30 awards were announced over the course of the next three hours, with trailers, game reveals, and world premieres that showed off what's next in gaming interspersed between these announcements. The team here at Windows Central watched and reported on the event as it unfolded, and you'll find live coverage of every winner and reveal right here (award winners are highlighted in bold below). Hello everyone, and welcome to our live coverage of The Game Awards 2024! The show may still be a day away, but there's already quite a few things to talk about ahead of its scheduled start time. There have been several teases of what to expect from the presentation from The Game Awards and its partners, all of which I'll be covering here shortly. There's quite a bit of stiff competition in this year's nominations, and there's some noteworthy controversy too; many are frustrated with the inclusion of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree in the running, for example, because it's ultimately still a DLC expansion even if it is the size of a standalone game. As usual, there are also lots of fans who feel their favorite game got snubbed from Game of the Year nominations or other categories (that's me with Helldivers 2, 100%). Still, I'm hoping that it'll be a great event, even if I still have a sour taste in my mouth from how The Game Awards 2023 let down developers and viewers alike by being more about advertisements and trailers than actually celebrating that year's best and brightest titles. Fingers crossed! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 began on December 12, with the show being streamed live at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. You can use the embedded YouTube livestream link above to watch the full three-hour presentation. The YouTube stream we embedded above is one way to watch this year's The Game Awards show, but it's not the only one. The presentation is being broadcast on a variety of different platforms once it begins on December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT, including the following: All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. If you end up having trouble with the stream on one platform, try using one of the others instead and hopefully it'll work better for you. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The vast majority of what's being shown at The Game Awards 2024 will remain a mystery until the show itself kicks off, but that doesn't mean we're going into it completely blind. In fact, the opposite is true, as many developers as well as Geoff Keighley himself have publicly teased several of the games, reveals, trailers, and performances that will appear during the event. These include the following: In addition to these, note that several celebrities and developers will be presenting awards throughout the evening, including Bethesda's Todd Howard, actress Isabela Merced from HBO's The Last of Us Season 2, Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, prolific game voice actor Laura Bailey, Remedy Entertainment's Sam Lake, and none other than Hideo Kojima himself. If we learn anything else about the show before it starts, I'll be sure to post about it here. With that said, I don't expect we will, as it's bound to have plenty of surprises that the showrunners don't want to spoil. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor what im expecting, without hard spoilers:- not a ton from xbox first party studios, pending xbox's own dev direct in q1. - lots of epic multiplat reveals.- other fun stuff.December 9, 2024 That's a direct quote from none other than Windows Central's very own executive editor and Xbox aficionado Jez Corden. Jez posted that to X (Twitter) a few days ago, clearly having heard about some of what's coming in this year's The Game Awards. He went on to say "without hard spoilers" that he's expecting to see impressive multiplatform announcements and "other fun stuff," though believes that Microsoft and Xbox won't have much to show since it has its own Developer_Direct presentation coming in Q1 2025. Sounds like we're in for a good show this year. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor With the actual The Game Awards show now under 24 hours away, I thought it would be fun to share what my personal picks for all of this year's 30 award categories are based on what got nominated and what I've gotten around to playing and watching. Here's my list: I begrudgingly voted for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for many of these categories, as while I absolutely love the expansion and think it's largely better than the nominees it's up against, I don't think DLCs should be included in The Game Awards unless they're in their own separate category. If it was up to me, Helldivers 2 would be in (and win) the Game of the Year running, and Players' Voice wouldn't have three gacha games nominated (players were encouraged to vote for them with promises of free currency in these games by their developers, which is pretty lame). Alas, it is not up to me, so here I sit. Salty. Still, it's nice to see the presentation and performances in Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 get the recognition they deserve, and I'm hoping Animal Well wins both indie awards since it's pretty mind-blowing a solo developer made such a deep and create Metroidvania. Shoutout to Manor Lords in Best Sim/Strategy, too; it's another excellent solo-developed project. Also, I really need to set a day or two aside to watch Arcane Season 2. Fallout probably wouldn't be my pick for Best Adaptation if I'd done so already, based on what I've heard. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Before the nominations were announced, I said that we riot if Balatro wasn't nominated for Game of the Year. Now it has been nominated, we riot if it doesn't win Game of the Year. Balatro isn't my most played game of 2024, but it's far and away my pick to claim that coveted prize. I could talk for hours about it, but I won't. The shortened version is that Balatro embodies everything about what makes a great game. At its core, it's pure fun. It doesn't hide behind complicated narratives, flashy graphics, or endless battle passes. It's just a really good, addictive, well-executed game that I can honestly say anyone I've turned to playing it has totally got why I, and so many others, love it so much. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor For Borderlands fans, The Game Awards is Christmas arriving early. We already know Borderlands 4 exists and is scheduled to drop in 2025, but beyond that, not a whole lot. The Game Awards is going to be the first big look at the "most ambitious Borderlands yet" and it's the thing I'm most excited for. Sure, I want Balatro to win GOTY, but I love Borderlands. The franchise that really kicked off the whole looter shooter genre with a bang, and without it, some of my favorite titles may never have come to be. Plus, Borderlands fits so well with my own ridiculous sense of humor, I have no doubts I'm going to enjoy what I see tonight. Bring it on! — Richard Devine, Managing Editor Hey there! Like the rest of the crew, I'm prepping to cover the winter gaming showca-er, the Game Awards 2024, and I'm excited to see what's in store. As we get closer, I figured I'd also share what my picks were from across all the nominations. Bear in mind, I'm following the rules of what got nominated, so no voting for Frostpunk 2 for Game of the Year, even if it should be a contender. Game of the Year: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Game Direction: Astro Bot Best Narrative: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Art Direction: Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Best Score and Music: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Audio Design: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Performance: Melina Juergens as Senua Innovation in Accessibility: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Games for Impact: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Ongoing: Diablo 4 Best Community Support: Helldivers 2 Best Independent Game: Balatro Best Debut Indie Game: Balatro Best Mobile Game: Balatro Best VR/AR: Asgard's Wrath 2 Best Action Game: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Best Action/Adventure: Astro Bot Best RPG: Dragon's Dogma 2 Best Fighting: Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Best Family: Astro Bot Best Sim/Strategy: Age of Mythology: Retold Best Sports/Racing: EA Sports FC 25 Best Multiplayer: Helldivers 2 Best Adaptation: Arcane Most Anticipated Game: Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Again, I emphasize that this is only me choosing based off what was available in each category. My real most anticipated game undoubtedly goes to DOOM: The Dark Ages, as I absolutely cannot wait to see what Bethesda and id Software have cooked up with this Medieval-themed prequel focused on the origin of the Slayer's war on demons. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Since it seems to be all the rage here in the Windows Central live hub for all The Game Awards 2024 news and announcements you need, I've decided to also submit my picks for each category. In my humble (and correct) opinion, here are the winners. I omitted the categories I honestly couldn't care less about, and for the most part stuck with games that I've actually played. If you couldn't tell already, my personal game of the year is absolutely Metaphor: ReFantazio, which I reviewed for Windows Central. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a stunning RPG with an intricate, emotional, and powerful narrative in an incredibly beautiful world. When it comes to RPG gameplay, narrative and game direction, and music. Metaphor: ReFantazio would've run away with art direction, too, but I had to give that to Neva, which I also reviewed and chose as the best indie game of the year. Of course, I also had to give plenty of love to Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, another game I reviewed for Windows Central and one of the most impressive accomplishments in art and narrative design in video games. In particular, Hellblade 2's impactful messaging, unbelievable audio design, and the emotionally devastating performance from Melina Juergens. Finally, justice for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown! Yes, I reviewed that, too. The Lost Crown is still one of my top games of the year, and it deserves at least one award at TGA. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Good morning, everyone! As I type this out, The Game Awards 2024 is now only seven hours away, so it won't be long before we find out which of the nominees in each category are going home with one (or more) of those iconic TGA trophies. We'll also get to see all the new trailers and reveals that developers around the industry have in store for players. Stay tuned with us throughout the day for live coverage before, during, and after the show as we report on and react to all the exciting news. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor See you @thegameawards Expect to be surprised! #TheGameAwardsDecember 12, 2024 Mere hours before the start of TGA 2024, Sloclap — the studio behind last year's excellent kung fu beat 'em up action game Sifu — has confirmed that it will have a presence at the show. It's also telling its fans to "expect to be surprised," which likely means we'll either get a new game announcement or perhaps a Sifu DLC reveal. Either one sounds great to me, so I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what Sloclap has in store for players. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor I've been a Call of Duty player for a long time. I'm significantly older than the top players of today, but I've been floating around since the beginning. I took a few years off, though, because the Modern Warfare titles didn't grab me, and I didn't enjoy Vanguard in my limited time with it at all. The latest, Black Ops 6, is up for Best Multiplayer at The Game Awards and I wholeheartedly believe it deserves to win. Not just because it would be a nice catch for the now Microsoft-owned franchise! Ignoring the anticheat woes and the usual community frustrations that you'll always get with a game of this type, Black Ops 6 is a return to form for Call of Duty. The multiplayer is fast and fun, and Omnimovement has made more difference to this than I think a lot would give it credit for. I'm over 230 hours deep already, mostly in multiplayer, which speaks volumes for someone that's avoided almost all PvP games for a few years! Helldivers 2 is also worthy, but I really think Black Ops 6 deserves recognition. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor While plenty of amazing games and talented teams are being recognized during the awards, there's one game that won't be present, and that's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. This excellent adventure title from MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks launched just a few days ago, well after the cutoff point for when a game needs to launch in order to be recognized and voted on. I do understand this, really. You have to have a cutoff point with lead time in order to allow the jury to reasonably vote, but it's such a shame that Indy won't be eligible this year, because I firmly believe he'd be a frontrunner for many. After all, this is my game of the year, and I wrote in my review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that "From the manner in which every line is delivered and scene is shot to the smirk on Indy's face when solving a puzzle, it's clear that everyone at MachineGames just gets what makes Indiana Jones so special. This is a game that can sit next to the original trilogy with pride." — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Samuel is absolutely right that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle deserved to be up in The Games Awards' lineup, but it did miss the cutoff date by several weeks. One game that didn't, though, was GSC Game World's highly anticipated survival shooter STALKER 2. The cutoff was originally scheduled for November 22, but it got pushed up with no stated reasoning from The Game Awards; this axed the eligibility of November 20's STALKER 2 at the eleventh hour, which is pretty royally unfair if you ask me. It really should have been up there, as I'd argue it's unquestionably one of this year's best games and an inspiring success story from a beleaguered Ukrainian developer that persisted in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion. Its initial reviews and overall Metacritic scores took a sizable hit from some gnarly performance issues at launch, but GSC quickly patched the game up effectively and have majorly improved the Xbox and Windows PC exclusive. That's allowed its incredibly immersive atmosphere, immensely rewarding open-world exploration, and tense moment-to-moment combat gameplay shine brightly; 84% of its 68,279 user reviews on Steam are positive. In my own review of STALKER 2, I wrote that the shooter "stands tall as one of the most captivating open-world shooters I've ever played, with palpable atmosphere and deeply rewarding exploration that kept me glued to my seat along with addictively intense and dynamic action that kept me on the edge of it." I'd definitely put it (along with Helldivers 2) in Game of the Year in place of Black Myth: Wukong or the Elden Ring DLC if it was eligible, and it should definitely be in the running for Best Action Game and/or Best Action/Adventure, too. The fact it wasn't available as an option to vote for is a real shame. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Storming into the live blog to rant about my own injustice in this year's Game Awards, well not mine, Poncle's. From late 2023 and throughout 2024, Vampire Survivors has received a number of either free or ridiculously cheap updates adding an insane amount of content to the game, from the Among Us and Contra crossovers, to the Darkasso update adding a slew of ridiculously powered new Arcanas. Finishing the year with a boom, we got the Ode to Castlevania DLC in October, which for the tiny price of $3.99 added the biggest map yet, 20 new characters and 40 new weapons. Or did it? No, Poncle hid even MORE content past the end credits, and without spoiling it for those who haven't played yet, you are in for your money's worth.I've put *checks notes* 58 hours into the DLC alone on Steam, and when the Game Awards made such a song and dance about DLC being eligible for awards, I really thought Vampire Survivors would get some well deserved recognition. Alas, it hasn't even been acknowledged in the ongoing game. A travesty.Balatro making it into the Game of the Year category is the only thing keeping me from full incandescent rage, that and good old BAFTA Games have longlisted Vampire Survivors in it's own awards, so fingers crossed Poncle will get the recognition they so deserve elsewhere. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor Balatro is absolutely clearing everying else in the Game of the Year category right now. Don't tell me I'm biased! Earlier this week, Cyberpunk 2077 paid homage to the game with a Balatro-inspired mission as a nod to Jimbo. Now, just over an hour ago, Balatro decided to keep the momentum going with a huge surprise—dropping the brand-new Friends of Jimbo 3 Pack 3 DLC on all platforms. This DLC features crossovers with deep breath Divinity: Original Sin 2, Shovel Knight, Potion Craft, Enter The Gungeon, Cult of the Lamb, Don't Starve, 1000xRESIST, and Warframe. The announcement came via an incredible trailer starring none other than Ben Starr, who plays our favorite Joker to perfection. Starr, who was nominated at last year’s Game Awards for his role in Final Fantasy 16, delivers a great performance in the trailer, which totally will not give me nightmares. With Balatro now celebrating 3.5 million copies sold, it’s no wonder it’s cementing its spot as one of the year’s best games. Honestly, it’s my personal Game of the Year winner—and with this level of content and creativity, it’s a title that’s more than well-deserved. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor This year's The Game Awards celebration is fairly unique, as it happens to be the 10th anniversary of the event that showrunner Geoff Keighley first established in 2014. Therefore, while it's commemorating all the amazing games that have released in 2024, it's also something of a ceremony for The Game Awards' success in the last decade as well. Geoff Keighley, executive producer Kimmie Kim, director Richard Preuss, and production designer LeRoy Bennett have all spoken about this year's show in a new Variety interview, with the team discussing The Game Awards' rise in popularity and production quality over time, its similarities and differences compared to other shows like the Oscars and VMAs, and its focus on celebrating recent games while simultaneously giving fans a sneak peek at the future. Notably, Keighley commented in the interview that some of what players will see goes beyond what's coming next year. "This audience really does want to see the future, so we’ll be focused not just on what’s happening in 2025 in gaming, but I think you’ll see some things that are even further out at the show," he said. Overall, it's an enjoyable read, and one worth checking out while we're waiting for the show to start. Only about three and a half hours to go! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor PRESENTED BY AGGRO CRAB:THE GAME AWARDS BINGO CARD 2024play along with us or just watch the chaos‼️ pic.twitter.com/tkfq2m9geADecember 12, 2024 It's impossible to know exactly what we'll see at The Game Awards, but trying to predict its schedule and then seeing if we're right is always a fun way to enjoy the show. That's the idea with bingo cards, and this one from Aggro Crab — the developer behind this year's excellent underwater Soulslike Another Crab's Treasure — is absolutely hilarious. It's chock full of funny references to controversial elements of this year's show (like the presence of Elden Ring's DLC) as well as jokes about its hosts, presenters, and past events (like Snoop Dogg and marijuana, the discussion about developer clothing last year, and Josef Fares' on-stage antics). I need to see Geoff Keighley bring an actual alligator on-stage to present something for Grand Theft Auto VI (set in a satirical version of Florida), but I'm going to be peeved if I have to cross off that "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" square. By the way, Another Crab's Treasure itself is a delightful indie, and if you play games on Xbox or PC, you can check it out with Xbox Game Pass. If you like Soulslikes, I strongly recommend it. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Hey gang, it's that time again. Geoff Keighley is out in force this year for The Game Awards, and the excitement is reaching fever pitch. There are rumors of all shapes and sizes flying around, and I've already posted some expectations on socials, but I want to add here what Xbox and Windows PC gamers can expect from Microsoft and its partners at this year's show. NO SPOILERS, though. From what I'm hearing, there will be at least a couple blockbuster announcements (initially shared by Jason Schrier on KindaFunny). One is a PlayStation exclusive fans should be very excited to see. However, at least one of the other major announcements should indeed represent a full multiplatform release across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It should spark a ton of excitement if true — although I'm not sure whether to expect this particular game to launch in the near term. As for Xbox itself, I expect the vast majority, if not every announcement relevant to Xbox to be a multiplatform affair. But there could be at least a couple of fun announcements, at least one could expand the already packed 2025 Xbox first-party slate. For my full The Game Awards predictions list, head over here. — Jez Corden, Executive Editor While we're all looking forward to the different announcements and awards, including seeing who wins Best Performance, it's extremely important to remember that SAG-AFTRA is still on strike. The union is seeking agreements to prevent abuse of AI, a hot topic across the game and tech industries. These actors are a huge reason why some of the biggest games can succeed, so if you've ever appreciated a performance like Maggie Robertson as Lady Dimitrescu or Troy Baker as Indiana Jones, you should be aware of what the concerns are as the strike continues. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor There are a lot of games nominated for awards this year, with a ton of genre variety throughout the full list. Even the most dedicated gamers likely haven't played all of them as a result — I haven't gotten around to playing half of the Game of the Year nominees, myself — but if you're looking to catch up on what you missed, you'll want to take advantage of these excellent limited-time deals. Amazon, Microsof (Xbox), and Sony (PS5) are all offering special discounts on The Game Awards 2024 nominees on their respective storefronts, along with price cuts on quality gaming accessories like mice, keyboards, headsets, controllers, and more. The PlayStation sale is the best one since that sale runs until December 16 (Microsoft's ends after the show), but they're all great, and they allow you to save 75% or more on many of this year's best games. Check them out! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 is now under one hour away from broadcasting live, so now's the time to get some grub or stretch for a while before settling in for the show. I'm going to eat a quick bite myself, but I'll be back soon to provide you with live coverage of the ceremony. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor T-minus 5 minutes away from the start of The Game Awards! Enjoy the show if you're watching live, and thanks for sticking with us as we report on all the cool stuff we're about to see. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 has kicked off with the announcement of Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, a new platformer in the legendary series headed your way in summer 2025. Hope you like packing (and unpacking). A cozy game about moving called One Move Away is coming in 2025, and it looks very relaxing to play! Last year's incredibly popular indie title Dave the Diver has an "In the Jungle" expansion coming in late 2025, so be ready for that if you're a fan! One of the most interesting games shown so far was Thick as Thieves, a stealth action game that looks heavily inspired by Dishonored. It's coming to Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5. This new 2D action platformer looks pretty fun, and there's good news: it's coming to all major platforms in 2025! That means Xbox, PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Another adorable cozy game that fans of Lords of the Rings will love is Tales of the Shire. It's headed to Xbox, PC, PS5, and Switch on March 25, 2025, and seems to be a farming/life simulator. Pugstorm, the team behind the critically acclaimed open-world survival crafting game Core Keeper, have announced Kyora — a new title that looks a whole lot like a spiritual successor to Terraria. You can wishlist it on Steam now. Sloclap, the team behind the high-octane action fighting game Sifu, decided they wanted to make a soccer game. And so, we have Rematch. Online soccer action! It's coming to Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation in summer 2025. Solasta 2 is a new tactical turn-based RPG that looks a whole lot like a Baldur's Gate-style tabletop game, and it's hitting Early Access on Steam in 2025. A free demo is coming soon, too! Slay the Spire's sequel has been highly anticipated for quite a while now, and we finally got a detailed new trailer at The Game Awards show. It's coming at some point next year in Early Access. Wow, Harrison Ford at The Game Awards! That's quite a surprise. I suppose it's fitting, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle proving to be a big hit! It was cool to see him next Troy Baker. What a surprise! CD PROJEKT RED has blown everyone away by revealing The Witcher 4, the long-awaited sequel to one of the best RPGs of all time, with an extended cinematic trailer. We won't be playing as Geralt this time, though; instead, you'll take control of none other than Ciri herself. Oh, nobody expected this! FromSoftware is making Elden Ring: Nightreign, a new co-op adventure game set in the developer's grand fantasy world. It's coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation next year! Team Ico, the developer behind Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian, made an appearance at The Game Awards 2024 with a trailer for a mysterious new game. We didn't get a name, but unsurprisingly, it's got huge scale — gigantic robots, specifically. Get hyped! The Outer Worlds 2, the sequel to Obsidian Entertainment's popular 2019 sci-fi RPG, is coming to Xbox, PC, and PS5 in 2025! At The Game Awards, it got an amusing new trailer that confirmed its release date. We've known it's coming for quite a while, but this was the first time we actually got a look at it. It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios had a big showing at The Game Awards, announcing its next co-op game Split Fiction. Uniquely, the game's levels feature a blend of both sci-fi and fantasy environments, so it should offer quite an interesting gameplay experience to enjoy with a friend. Oh, and it's scheduled to come out March 6! The popular 2014 winter survival game The Long Dark is one of the most atmospheric I've ever played, so I was excited to see that a sequel called The Long Dark 2: Blackfrost got announced during the show. It's expected to enter Early Access in 2026! The Borderlands 4 trailer we knew was coming today got shown, and it looks like it'll offer all the explosive action longtime fans crave. It's coming to Xbox, Steam, and PlayStation in 2025, which was a nice surprise to learn about! Those who have been following the mech action title Mecha BREAK will be happy to know it's officially scheduled to drop next year in spring, and will be available on Xbox and PC. Interestingly, it will have an advanced AI NPC that can answer pretty much any question you ask it. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, announced what looks to be a new action game called Project Century. The dev also briefly went over what looks to be something new for the Virtua Fighter series. Few specific details were given, though! CALLING ALL HELLDIVERS! Helldivers 2 had a HUGE showing at The Game Awards, with a new Omens of Tyranny update going LIVE shortly after a trailer that showed off the arrival of the Illuminate faction, urban city maps, the long-awaited APC vehicle, and more! I know what I'm playing the second I'm done covering this show! A short trailer was shown for Palworld's upcoming Feybreak update during the show, with a December 23 release date revealed. On that day, you'll be able to play on Xbox, PC, and PS5. Fans of Onimusha, a classic Capcom action/adventure franchise, will be happy to hear that we're getting a brand new entry called Way of the Sword in 2026. The cinematic trailer shown didn't include gameplay, but it sure did have plenty of bloody samurai action. It's coming to Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC. Techland's parkour-heavy survival action franchise Dying Light is getting its next entry with Dying Light: The Beast, and today we learned it's scheduled to release on Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC in summer 2025. The news came alongside a sweet new trailer with plenty of zombie-slaying action. Well hey, would you look at that! A Game of Thrones action/adventure game that's coming in 2025, complete with characters from the popular HBO TV show and plenty of medieval-fantasy action. It's platforms haven't been revealed yet, though! Did The Last of Us Part 2 need a remaster? No. Would one make a ton of money? Definitely. Therefore, Sony and Naughty Dog remastered it this year, and are now bringing it to PC next year on April 3, 2025. The new Mafia game, The Old Country, got teased well before The Game Awards itself, and now we finally got to see its debut trailer during it. It's coming in summer 2025, so it's coming soon! Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul and world-famous video game voice actress Laura Bailey star in a new story adventure game called Dispatch that's coming in 2025. Its stylized art direction looks great, and I'm looking forward to checking it out next year. That's another one we definitely didn't see coming! Okami, Capcom's beloved single player action/adventure game from 2006, is finally getting a sequel. It got announced during an amazing The Game Awards Orchestra performance, and is entering production shortly. Another huge surprise! Naughty Dog showed up with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a new PS5 game that's apparently been in development for four years now. Here's a quote from the trailer's description: "Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit." And Astro Bot takes home the prestigious Game of the Year win! Congratulations to Team ASOBI on its victory, and to all the other games that were nominated. I was definitely expecting Black Myth: Wukong or Metaphor: ReFantazio to win, so this was quite a surprise! The Game Awards 2024 is now officially over, but man, what a show it was — an absolutely colossal three and a half hour ceremony with a crazy amount of new trailers and reveals, including many announcements that blew us away! Below, I've rounded up our in-depth coverage of all the highlights for you to read through if you missed the event... ...and also the trailers that slipped through my rapidly typing fingers due to the event's rapid pace: Thanks for sticking with me for the show! I'll write up more of my full thoughts shortly, but overall, I thought this was easily one of the best The Game Awards shows ever...even if it was extremely long. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Coming off of last year's extremely disappointing The Game Awards show that was rife with speeches rushed by "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" signs, tons of annoying advertisements, and zero attempts to raise awareness about the gaming industry's ongoing layoff issues at all, I wasn't exactly feeling optimistic about the 2024 iteration of the event. Yet while it still had a few too many ads for my liking, I have to say that I'm still extremely impressed by what Geoff Keighley and company put together this time around. Not only were there a series of truly wild announcements — the reveal of the dedicated co-op game Elden Ring: Nightreign blew my mind, other huge titles like The Witcher 4 looked fantastic too, and oh my god, that Helldivers 2 Illuminate update shadow drop — but we also got some fantastic musical performances, plenty of great speeches from developers speaking from the heart, and an entire segment dedicated to discussing the layoffs. Put simply, that was one of the best The Game Awards shows Geoff Keighley and his teams have put on yet, and it might even be the best one. I suppose that's only fitting for the event's 10th anniversary! Whether you watched The Game Awards alongside myself and my co-workers live or you used this live blog to keep tabs on all the big announcements and award results, thank you for joining me tonight. Myself and the rest of the Windows Central Gaming team will continue writing up our thoughts, reactions, and maybe even a few spicy hot takes tonight and tomorrow, though, so stay tuned for additional commentary. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 have concluded, and I'm honestly pleasantly surprised as a whole. Geoff Keighley seems to have taken feedback from previous years, resulting in a show that's more self-aware, more willing to poke fun at itself, more transparent, and more open to addressing the current events of the video games industry. There were a lot of great game announcements and performances, too, and most of the game award categories felt uncharacteristically reasonable. I was in high spirits (apart from my crushing exhaustion, my gods what a long show) up until the end, when the Game of the Year was announced. In my eyes, only one game truly earned the title in 2024, as the game with the most unyielding narrative impact, memorable art design, worldbuilding, and music, and enrapturing mixed-genre RPG gameplay. Of course, I'm speaking about Metaphor: ReFantazio, which has stood uncontested as my personal GotY since I reviewed it. Don't get me wrong, Astro Bot is a phenomenal 3D platformer with practically zero flaws, and I'm happy The Game Awards took time to recognize Astro Bot in a variety of categories. Smaller, less ambitious games like Astro Bot are often overlooked entirely, so I loved seeing it awarded alongside other brilliant games this year like Neva and Balatro. Despite its excellence, though, I don't believe Astro Bot was the best choice for Game of the Year. While perfectly polished, accessible to players of all ages, and a highlight of PlayStation's first-party output this year (we won't talk about Concord), Astro Bot feels like the safe play for The Game Awards. In contrast, Metaphor: ReFantazio is bold, obviously making zero attempt to appeal to mainstream audiences and instead focusing on delivering the absolute best gameplay, story, world and character building, and art design possible. It succeeds, to the point where I almost began a New Game+ immediately after rolling the credits on my 85-hour playthrough. I almost never feel like that with games, I often begin burning out around the 40-hour mark. Still, while I may disagree... Congratulations to Astro Bot on winning Game of the Year, Best Game Direction (Metaphor: ReFantazio also should've won that, cough cough), Best Action/Adventure Game, and Best Family Game. Of course, congratulations to Atlus and Metaphor: ReFantazio on winning Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, and Best RPG. You should've swept with Best Score and Music, too. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Nothing is ever perfect, but I'll say that this year's show was significantly better than what we saw in 2023. Developers were actually given a bit of time to accept their awards without being hurried along, and even if it wasn't too sharply pointed, we did get some commentary about the awful layoffs that have ravaged the industry over the last two years. Well done to Keighley and crew for accepting at least some of the feedback levied since last year. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Brendan Lowry is a Windows Central writer and Oakland University graduate with a burning passion for video games, of which he's been an avid fan since childhood.

Title: Washington Post faces editorial turmoil and high-profile departures

Geoff Bennett Geoff Bennett Azhar Merchant Azhar Merchant Leave your feedback Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs. It's the latest hit for the Post, coming just days after longtime editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned in protest. A series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash are raising questions about owner Jeff Bezos and the leadership of the Post. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Kara Swisher. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs that are expected to be announced this week. It's the latest hit for The Post, coming just days after a longtime editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, resigned in protest. Her editor rejected her latest cartoon, which depicted Post owner Jeff Bezos and other media leaders on bended knee before president-elect Trump. The Post said the cartoon was rejected because it had been repetitive of a recent column and another that was set to be published. Her editor in the statement said, in part: "Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force." To many observers, though, it's the latest in a series of events that are raising questions about Bezos and the leadership of The Post, including a series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash. For more on that, we're joined now by Kara Swisher, multiplatform journalist, entrepreneur, and author of "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story." Thanks so much for being with us. Kara Swisher, Author, "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story": Thank you for having me. Geoff Bennett: And we should mention that you are putting together an investor group to buy The Washington Post. Jeff Bezos has… Kara Swisher: I'm thinking about it, yes. Geoff Bennett: Thinking about it. Kara Swisher: Yes, I have been talking — I'm talking to a lot of people because I'm just disturbed by what's happening there. I'm sure other people are too. The question is if he wants to sell it. He hasn't indicated any interest whatsoever, but I wanted to raise the idea because I think it needs new leadership and new management. Geoff Bennett: And — right, I was going to say he's given no indication that he intends to sell it. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: But what's the vision? Why are you in the hunt? Kara Swisher: Well, I started off at The Washington Post in the newsroom — in the mailroom. Excuse me. That's where I started my career when I was at college at Georgetown University. And so that was my first job. And I worked there for many years. I started covering the Internet there, which is my big area. I went on to work at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and did a whole bunch of different things, including a very famous tech conference that was pretty good. And so I have been watching what's happening at The Post for a long time. And I was quite heartened when the Grahams, family which had owned it for so many years, sold it to Jeff Bezos. And in the initial years, he did a very good job. He got it for a very low amount of money, by the way. But he was doing a very good job. And it's just recently that his business interests are not aligned with The Post. And everything he's done so far over the past, I don't know, year or so has been pretty questionable, I would say, not because necessarily it's malign. I don't — I mean, bringing in malign forces, it sort of takes it to a new level. I think he has business interests that are not aligned with The Post. And some of his selections have been bad, including pulling the endorsement of Kamala Harris at the last minute. There's always some excuse. He didn't see it. He didn't read it. It doesn't really matter. He's involving himself in ways that are aren't working for The Post, which is also in distress as a business at this moment. Geoff Bennett: Well, on that point, I mean, strong journalistic ethics prioritize independence. Kara Swisher: Sure. Geoff Bennett: And Jeff Bezos obviously isn't a journalist. He's a businessman. Kara Swisher: No, of course. Geoff Bennett: And you can make the argument that he has a fiduciary responsibility to minimize any scrutiny or retaliation that could affect The Post or his broader media empire. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: I mean, what do you say to that argument? Kara Swisher: Well, there's only one shareholder here, and that's Jeff Bezos. So he can do whatever he wants. So it's not like it's a public company, and there's other things. But other public companies have been very explicit that they're going to do fair and accountability coverage of the things. And I think some of the actions he's taken, including with Ann, who's an amazing Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, I don't think Jeff had anything to do with this decision. I think it was done by David Shipley. But it's in this mood of not poking the bear, I think, the bear being Trump or Jeff Bezos. I don't know which one they're not trying to poke. But what happened to The Post was, Jeff bought it in 2013 and did a lot of stuff that improved it, but they never really figured out what to do post the first Trump era, which gave a bump to a lot of people. And so, in many ways, it's his fault of where it is. And now he's doing things that are making it worse. And I'm not sure why, right? I'm not sure what's happening with him. And I think he's — again, he's been a very good owner until recently, I would say. And now he just doesn't — I'd like to know why he wants to own it, what his plans are. The plans that they have outlined seem preposterous, really. I don't know what else to say. He's a very good businessperson, but a lot of these ideas are really an antithesis of what an independent newspaper should be. And I don't mean to stay in the past. And The Post has a storied history. I'm a journalist who's blown up a lot of things. I believe in changing and shifting. But you have to come up with something that preserves the integrity of The Post and at the same time makes it into a pretty good business. Geoff Bennett: Are there lessons The Post could learn from The New York Times' multimedia diversification… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … or from the rise of digital native outlets like Axios or Substack or Semafor? The list goes on. Kara Swisher: Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I did the first one, which was called AllThingsD at The Wall Street… Geoff Bennett: That's right. Yes. Kara Swisher: We — Walt and I — Walt Mossberg were the O.G. of all this stuff. It's funny when it's like, oh, this is new. I'm like, no, we did it a long time ago, because we did see what was coming and the importance of digitization of media and how the consumer had changed really drastically. And we also supplemented it by having a conference that was highly lucrative that could pay the bills too, because news is hard. Advertising is tougher. Some people have done subscriptions really well. Like, The Information does great journalism and does subscriptions. Other things rely on advertising, like we did at AllThingsD, or sponsorship like we did at the Code Conferences. There's all kinds of things you could look at, and The New York Times is one way of doing it. They do everything, they cook everything internally, right? But they did an important diversification. News is not the driver of the growth of The New York Times right now. It's Wordle. It's cooking. It's sports. It's all kinds of things. And that's important, for a news organization to have multiple revenue streams around it, especially as people, especially young people, go off and get things from TikTok or Instagram or wherever they happen — or YouTube, for example, has become critically important in the TV watching space. And so The Post hasn't really done anything. They don't have a podcast division to speak of. Other companies have done a really good job at that, and it can be very lucrative. I have some ideas, which I will outline if I get a meeting with Jeff. I have known him for — I knew — I met Jeff before he was a billionaire, when he first started Amazon. He's a wonderful entrepreneur. And I think he has to understand that maybe where he is today is not where he was and that he may not be the correct owner for this thing. That's all. I just want to talk to you about it and understand why he wants to own it if he continues to do these things that are causing a huge amount of people to leave, very — a huge amount of talent. And that's not — that's hard to get back. So I have some ideas of different structures, financial structures, the way you could do it, and I'm sure other people do. Geoff Bennett: Well, if you could redesign the current media ecosystem to better serve the public in this polarized… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … fractured and fast-paced era, what would you prioritize, especially since, after this last election, we learned to the degree to which legacy media has limited reach and limited influence? Kara Swisher: Yes. Well, that's been happening for a long time. It's something I warned of in my book and many — for years and years, I wrote this column. I'm like, everything that — the thing I said over and over again is, everything that can be digitized will be digitized and it was, right? This was at the beginning of my career. And I think one of the things they have to recognize is, where is the audience? The audience has taken control of the media. And it's not giving it back any time soon. So you go where they are going, you try to create things they want to consume. It doesn't have to be light. It doesn't have to — there's a terrible word in media, make it snackable. I think that's the worst thing I have ever heard in my life. But make it interesting. I mean, I have a million ideas of what you can do and how you could structure it so it's more protected. But being at the mercy and kindness of billionaires, good luck with that. I'm sorry. It's — maybe a lot of billionaires, so none of them have control, but a single billionaire? I don't care how you slice it. And I don't know how nice that billionaire is. It's never going to end well. It just isn't. Geoff Bennett: Kara Swisher, thanks for joining us. We deeply appreciate it. Kara Swisher: Thank you. Thank you.

Title: Quest Pro Is Now Officially Discontinued
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-pro-officially-discontinued/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T23:18:33Z
Full Content:
Quest Pro is no longer available to buy from Meta, though stock is still available at some retailers. Meta announced the retirement of both Quest 2 and Quest Pro at its Connect conference back in September, saying that the two headsets will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. For Quest 2, stock ran out within a few weeks of Connect. For Quest Pro, it appears the other clause applied. With the arrival of the new year, the headset's page on Meta's website has been replaced with a "Meta Quest Pro is no longer available" notice, alongside an image and price of Quest 3, Meta's new highest-end offering. With Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of Quest 3 gone, Meta's headset lineup has been simplified to: After Quest 2 became the first mainstream VR headset, Meta hoped it could build on this success by introducing a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in late 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a curved battery in the rear of the strap, and the ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was severely lacking, given its price. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful GPU at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of ability to generate a scene mesh for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And last year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. With Quest Pro off the market, Meta no longer sells any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time later this year, and we'll keep a close eye on those companies for any signs of that happening.

And in 2025, the theme is looking to be powerful yet again given the increasing adoption and red-hot demand we’ve heard about from companies in their quarterly updates. Several stocks, including Palantir PLTR, Broadcom AVGO, and, of course, Nvidia NVDA, look to have a strong year on the back of their AI-related offerings and services. Let’s take a closer look at each. Broadcom has quickly risen to the top concerning AI players, with its latest set of quarterly results fully confirming robust demand. Its FY24 has just ended, with annual revenue of $51.6 billion reflecting a new record and growing 44% year-over-year on the back of strong demand for its solutions. Impressively, record annual semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion in FY24 was driven by its leading AI XPUs, with AI revenue overall growing 220% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Broadcom’s earnings outlook has also shifted positively across the board following the latest set of results, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its next quarterly results are scheduled for March, with early consensus expectations alluding to 36% EPS growth on 22% higher sales. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Palantir’s robust share performance has been fueled by the AI frenzy, with the company’s latest set of quarterly results pleasing investors in a big way. The strong results and favorable commentary have caused analysts to raise their earnings expectations, with the stock sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s sales have snowballed thanks to strong AI demand, with sales of $726 million throughout its latest period growing 30% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As shown below, PLTR’s sales have consistently grown sequentially over the years. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investor-favorite Nvidia continues to fire on all cylinders, with its Data Center results regularly blowing away expectations and posting big year-over-year growth. Like those above, its earnings outlook has brightened nicely over recent months, with positive revisions regularly hitting the tape following quarterly prints. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As shown below, the Data Center results have been notably bullish, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.8 billion amid another period of scorching-hot demand. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Jensen Huang, CEO, wrapped up the latest set of quarterly results with a bullish statement: “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” Bottom Line The AI-frenzy isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, with demand expected to remain red-hot as more increasingly adopt the technology. And for those looking for exposure in 2025, all three stocks above – Palantir PLTR, Broadcom AVGO, and, of course, Nvidia NVDA – are prime selections, with each sporting a positive earnings outlook.

Title: Nvidia Stock Pops 4%—On Track For Record Close Ahead Of Jensen Huang CES Keynote

Full Content:
Nvidia added some $140 billion in market value Monday ahead of a key speech from its centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang, briefly reclaiming the mantle as the most valuable company on earth for the unquestioned leader of the generative artificial intelligence wave. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech last June. Shares of Nvidia climbed 3.4% to $149.43 per share, besting their previous record close of $148.88 set Nov. 7. The Monday surge sent Nvidia’s market capitalization to as high as $3.73 trillion, briefly eclipsing the market cap of Apple before the iPhone maker narrowly took back its title later in the afternoon — Nvidia is less than $40 billion away from its first market close as the world’s highest valued company since Nov. 25, according to YCharts data. The Nvidia rally came amid a broader rally in U.S. technology stocks — the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose more than 1% to a 2025 high — and a global spike in share prices of other players in the semiconductor chip industry, as shares of Netherlands-based ASML, Taiwan-based TSMC and UK-based Arm Holdings gained at least 4% apiece. Semiconductor stocks received a boost from record fourth quarter revenue data from the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, a bullish signal for to-be-reported Q4 data for Nvidia and other AI companies. Also helping Nvidia and its peers was the Washington Post reporting President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs will initially target sectors other than semiconductors, good news for an industry heavily reliant on the global supply chain for designing and manufacturing the chips powering technology from iPhones to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot (Trump denied the report). Huang will deliver Monday’s keynote address at the CES 2025 technology conference beginning at approximately 6:30 p.m. EST. The speech should include “reassuring updates” on the company’s Blackwell and Rubin graphics processing unit systems, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a recent note to clients, predicting Huang’s speech will be a “positive catalyst” for the stock. Rosenblatt analysts Kevin Cassidy and Hans Mosesmann concurred they expect to see a “bullish Jensen Huang” on Monday, laying out a case for Nvidia’s competitive advantage in addressing the full-stack of technology needed to power AI. Nvidia designs a majority of the custom semiconductor chips powering generative AI systems, and its notable clientele includes Amazon, Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Founded in 1993 by Huang and two other engineers, Nvidia spent much of its existence best known for its video games graphics business before rising to fame as the face of the 2020s AI boom. No company has ever achieved a $4 trillion valuation, though Apple and Nvidia are both within 10% of hitting the milestone. 786%. That’s how much Nvidia’s share price has risen since Nov. 30, 2022, the launch of ChatGPT. An $1,000 investment in Nvidia at that time is now worth nearly $9,000. Huang’s net worth rose by about $5 billion Monday, the third most of any billionaire, according to our real-time net worth tracker. Huang’s $131 billion fortune makes him the ninth-richest person on the planet, rising more than twentyfold over the last five years. Most of Huang’s net worth comes from his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, the largest of any individual. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Acquires Radio Spectrum for Cellular Satellite Service

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. AST SpaceMobile, a rival to SpaceX's cellular Starlink business, has reached a deal to access its own slice of radio spectrum to power satellite communications for phones. AST SpaceMobile secured the radio spectrum from Ligado Networks, which is also working on cellular satellite services with partners such as Viasat and Skylo. But on Monday, Ligado filed for bankruptcy and entered into a spectrum deal with AST for about $113 million in stock. In return, AST gains the spectrum rights to a 45MHz block of Ligado’s L-band spectrum in the US and Canadian markets for 80+ years. The company is hailing the announcement as a win since it promises to bolster AST’s ability to beam satellite data to phones through the additional radio bands. It also means AST can offer its cellular satellite services independently, without always relying on its carrier partners. In the US, AST has reached deals with AT&T and Verizon to one day beam satellite connectivity to customer phones, but through their own licensed radio spectrum. AST didn’t go into details, but it expects the Ligado deal to help it increase its capacity “while enabling peak data transmission speeds up to 120Mbps to everyday smartphones everywhere in the continental United States.” On the downside, AST may need to redesign its BlueBird satellites to harness the L-band spectrum, according to satellite industry analyst Tim Farrar, who added that older phones typically don’t support L-band reception. AST launched its first batch of BlueBird satellites into Earth’s orbit in September. But the company still needs to launch dozens of additional satellites before it can begin offering full coverage to US customers. In addition, AST still needs to receive regulatory approval to both test and commercially operate such services in the US. In the meantime, the company’s deal with Ligado is expected to close during the first half of 2025. AST also notes Ligado could receive $550 million from the deal, depending on certain closing conditions. In addition, AST SpaceMobile would pay about $80 million per year for spectrum usage rights and “provide Ligado with long-term net revenue sharing rights.” I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Title: Report -- 'The Cuts Will Be Deep': Washington Post to Lay Off Dozens of Staffers

Time Published: 2025-01-06T18:30:02Z
Full Content:
The Washington Post will reportedly lay off dozens of its staffers in the next few days, the news coming after the publication caught flak for not endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris (D) during the presidential election that Donald Trump won in November. In his article published on Status, Oliver Darcy wrote Sunday that “the layoffs are slated to hit the Jeff Bezos-owned and Will Lewis-led newspaper’s business division, I’m told. One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees.” Bezos has reportedly been shaking up the Post after it decided not to endorse Harris, according to Breitbart News. Darcy continued: The layoffs will surely deplete morale further inside the beleaguered newspaper, which has suffered a talent exodus over the last several weeks. As I reported earlier, star reporter Josh Dawsey will exit The Post for a job at The Wall Street Journal. His departure comes on the heels of other top staffers fleeing, including Matea Gold, Ashely Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz. The newspaper has been struggling financially and the issues were “exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” he added. In November, the Post‘s senior politics editor claimed the newspaper removed him, per Breitbart News. After his decision not to endorse Harris, Bezos offered Trump a “big congratulations” on his “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” According to Breitbart News, Bezos, who founded Amazon, has large contracts with the U.S. government. Meanwhile, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the Post and accused her editor of killing a drafted cartoon due to its mocking depiction of Bezos and Trump, Breitbart News reported Sunday: “I’ve worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations — and some differences — about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now,” Telnaes said. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: Meta, Snap Enjoy Wall Street Surge as TikTok Ban Looms

Stock prices for Snapchat and Instagram’s parent companies have jumped as chief competitor TikTok approaches its ban date Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, saw their recent Wall Street hot streak continue Monday, as tech companies including Google-owned YouTube stand to benefit the most from TikTok’s looming ban set for Jan. 19. By midday Monday, Snap’s stock was up 3.4% to $12.38 per share. Those gains added to Snap’s recent run, with the company, led by CEO Evan Spiegel, seeing its stock price jump 15% in the past week. Snap’s stock was given a “buy” rating by Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Friday, with Morris projecting Snapchat added 8 million daily users between October and December. Those user gains would push Snapchat to 451 million daily users by the end of Q4. Snap is expected to share its Q4 report in early February. Meta, meanwhile, has enjoyed more modest gains — its stock price is up 2.7% on Monday, hitting $619.31 per share, and has increased 5.2% in the past week. And Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, has made similar gains. Alphabet’s stock is up 3% on Monday to $198.93 per share, and its share price is up about 4.5% in the past week. The recent gains for those tech giants indicates investors could be looking to put their money into platforms that would benefit from TikTok being booted from the U.S. The popular app, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, is set to be banned from the States on Jan. 19 — one day before president-elect Donald Trump takes office. The TikTok ban was initially floated during Trump’s first administration, before ultimately being passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden in April. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers have with TikTok is that it doubles as a spyware app for the Chinese government; TikTok, according to Chinese law, is required to share user data with China’s communist government, if it is asked to do so. Trump has since changed his tune on supporting a TikTok ban, saying last year that he’d like to “save” the app. And last month, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. TikTok has been scrambling to find a legal remedy to keep its app in the U.S. as its ban date approaches. In mid-December, The U.S. Supreme Court said it would listen to arguments from TikTok on why it should block the law behind the ban. That crucial hearing is set for Friday.

The Dow regained momentum by mid-morning on Monday as AI stocks surged. Electronic giant Foxconn (HNHPF-3.17%) reported record-breaking revenue for its fourth quarter, and the artificial intelligence boom continues into 2025. Benefiting from the so-called “January effect,” investors returning from the holidays injected fresh capital into the market. While the day started off slow, the stock market found its rhythm as the session progressed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 365 points or 0.8% up in the afternoon trading. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Foxconn (HNHPF-3.17%), formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Sunday reported revenue of $2.13 trillion in New Taiwan dollars ($65 billion) for the October to December period. Despite revenue falling month-over-month in November and December, the world’s largest electronics maker recorded growth in each month compared to a year earlier. That gave the company a 15% year-over-year increase, a record for the major Apple supplier. Shares of semiconductor companies across the world rose on the news of Foxconn’s revenue and first-quarter forecast, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces about 90% of the world’s chips. TSMC (TSM+0.60%) stock rose almost 5% in pre-market trading in New York, adding to its major rally in 2024. Nvidia stock was up more than 2% in early trading, building on its own supersized gains in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-5.06%) stock rose by almost 3%, while Intel (INTC-3.55%) shares ticked up slightly by 1% and Synopsys (SNPS-1.88%) shares climbed 2% in pre-market trading. Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 level, climbing 4% in a single day. Investors are optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s future amid political and regulatory shifts, including Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20 and the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The rally isn’t limited to Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have also gained traction, with Ether up 2%, Solana rising 3.6%, and Dogecoin increasing by 1.5%. The surge in Bitcoin’s price has sent crypto stocks higher as well. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN-0.68%) shares jumped 6.3%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR+0.46%) rose 5.5% following reports of its latest Bitcoin purchase. Today, the business intelligence firm bought 1,070 coins for approximately $101 million. This acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 447,470 coins, valued at $45.67 billion at the current price level. — William Gavin contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nova Measuring, other semiconductor equipment names gain following upgrades
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nova-measuring-other-semiconductor-equipment-names-gain-following-upgrades-93CH-3798139

Investing.com -- Shares of semiconductor equipment companies, including Nova Measuring (NASDAQ:NVMI) Instruments (NASDAQ: NVMI), Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:VECO), MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MKSI), Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:AEIS), and FormFactor (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:FORM), have witnessed a significant uptick in today's trading session. Nova Measuring Instruments' stock rose 7%, Veeco Instruments' and MKS Instruments' shares also jumped 7%, while Advanced Energy Industries and FormFactor saw increases of 3.5% and 5%, respectively. The upward movement in these stocks follows a series of upgrades by analysts at Citi. The companies have been facing a challenging environment due to a combination of factors, including a correction in the second half of 2024, weaker consumer memory demand, and additional U.S. restrictions impacting China's domestic spending. Despite these headwinds, analysts believe that the risk-reward is now skewed to the upside, with the stocks trading closer to historically attractive price-to-earnings levels and at a discount to broader market indices. "We go all in and upgrade NVMI, VECO, MKSI, AEIS, and FORM," stated analyst Atif Malik, indicating a positive shift in sentiment towards these companies. This bullish stance is supported by the expectation that key performance indicators such as estimate revisions and memory pricing momentum are likely to bottom out in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, continued investments in AI are expected to provide tailwinds for the sector. The broader outlook for the semiconductor equipment industry remains cautious, with expectations for the capital expenditures (capex) in the industry to decline by 5% year-over-year (YoY) in 2025. Analysts anticipate that leading-edge AI investments will be fully offset by weaker demand in mature logic industrial and automotive sectors, as well as a decline in China's domestic spending. For memory, a decrease in DRAM spending by 23% is expected, counterbalanced by investments in High Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Memory (HBM), while NAND spending is projected to remain flat due to delayed technology migrations. Looking ahead, analysts expect semiconductor equipment makers to lower their previous growth expectations for the industry in January, following a warning from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) about cuts in NAND capex. This recalibration is seen as a clearing event for the sector, with the replenishment of PC DRAM inventory and the bottoming out of DRAM prices in the second quarter of 2025 as the next major catalysts. Among the smaller to mid-sized companies, Nova Measuring Instruments is favored for its broad metrology products portfolio and diversified exposure across leading foundry, logic, and HBM customers. Veeco Instruments is recognized for its share gains in laser and nanosecond annealing, positioning these companies well for potential growth opportunities in 2025.

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Michael Ofei Want to know the most effective ecommerce growth strategy? I studied successful online stores to find out what works best. While every store’s path is unique, clear patterns emerged. Here are some examples: Whether your goal is to do $1M or $100M, it comes from executing the fundamentals. I’ve distilled this guide to the five most impactful growth strategies, including: Let’s start with the most important one. Most ecommerce failures share one root cause: creating products nobody wants. Or products that are okay but never really get traction. You follow trends. Copy competitors. Trust your gut. Then invest thousands in inventory and marketing, hoping customers will buy. The solution? Talk to your customers. One honest conversation today could prevent massive product failures tomorrow. These chats reveal opportunities like: Conversations also build relationships. They turn customers into fans who drive growth through word-of-mouth. By talking to customers, founders Aaron Spivak and Lior Ohayon turned $4,000 into $48M in 48 months. For example, when summer sales dropped, they scheduled customer calls. The feedback was clear: “We love the blanket, but we’re sweating. It’s in storage until winter.” – Aaron Spivak That single insight led to their breakthrough “ice fabric” technology, which: The entrepreneurs continued talking to customers to inform product development. “When people ask what our marketing hack is or which agency we worked with, they miss the point. We had 3,000 people on the phone tell us exactly what they wanted. That’s the real secret.” – Aaron Spivak It’s easy to overthink product research. But Hush proved that you just need to begin talking to customers. Here’s a simple process to get started: The goal is to build such deep customer understanding that product failures become nearly impossible. When we consume 6 hours of content daily, attention is the most valuable currency in business. Storytelling is how you earn it. Why? Stories stick. You may not remember product specs, but you likely recall Sara Blakely cutting the feet off her pantyhose to create Spanx. Or Patagonia’s founder testing gear on mountain expeditions. Most brands miss by showing only the highlight reel—the wins, the perfect moments, and the polished content. Telling raw, relatable stories is how you build a lasting brand. In 2018, Jake Karls and his co-founders launched Mid Day Squares with a radical commitment to transparency. They documented everything about building the company—from production line disasters to legal battles to funding negotiations. Mid Day Sqaures unconventional approach involved: “When people ask what’s our marketing hack or which agency we worked with, they’re missing the point. Building in public and sharing our authentic story turned customers into fans who felt like they were buying from friends.” – Jake Karls Mid Day Squares grew to over $20 million in revenue. And Jake attributes much of their success to creative content. But brand storytelling isn’t just for founder-led content. When Rachel Wilde started TBH Skincare, she took a different approach to content marketing. In addition to founder stories, she created content on real customer experiences. It focused on honest education about acne treatment. “I always say start with the customer. Understand what they want, and hit them with the right with the right message in the right place at the right time.” – Rachel Wilde This customer-first storytelling shaped every aspect of their content, including: They allocated 80% of the marketing budget to content creation. It built a storytelling engine that helped customers see themselves in the products. And it worked. TBH Skincare grew to $14M ($22M AUD) in four years. Before investing in content, identify what makes your brand relatable. Here are some best practices to get started: Read more: What is Content Marketing? Complete Beginners Guide When you nail your brand’s narrative, you create compelling organic content. But that’s just the beginning. You’re also building marketing assets that drive results across every channel. Your content becomes fuel for: “Most brands create different content for each marketing channel. We just document our journey and then adapt those stories for different platforms. It’s more authentic and way more efficient.” – Jake Karls The TBH Skincare team has found authentic stories outperform traditional ads across every channel. “When you have a piece of content that really resonates with people, you can use it everywhere. Our best-performing ads weren’t planned campaigns—they were real moments we captured and then amplified.” – Rachel Wilde The lesson? View storytelling as the key to better marketing. It’ll boost all your other channels. Every day, billions of people tell Google exactly what they want to buy. Capturing this traffic isn’t cheap or easy—but it’s steady. Paid search gives instant traffic but needs constant investment. Organic search is free but takes time to build up. Together, they drive consistent sales. Read more: SEO vs. SEM: What’s the Difference? When MX Store, Australia’s largest online motorcycle parts retailer, first tried Google Ads, their approach was typical. Broad keywords. Generic ads. Homepage traffic. Like throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping something sticks. So they shifted their approach—led by marketing director Dan Turner. “The key is perfect alignment. Your keyword matches the intent, your ad matches the keyword, and your landing page matches the ad. No disconnects.” – Dan Turner Here’s exactly what they changed: The result? A consistent 10x return on ad spend (ROAS). Before you spend a dollar on ads, understand your profit. Then, analyzing your competitors and keyword research follows. Work out how much you can spend to get a customer while making a profit. Without this calculation, you risk burning your ad budget on dud campaigns. To avoid this mistake, note three metrics: Here’s an example of the math: The maximum CAC calculation is $50 profit ÷ 3 = $16.67 maximum ad spend per customer. With a 2% conversion rate, you can’t spend over $16.67 to acquire a customer while keeping campaigns profitable. Keyword research answers a simple question: are people searching for what you’re selling? Start by Googling your products to see what ads are displaying. For example, here’s what the ads look like for “pendulum lights.” There are lots of ads, which implies they’re working. You could theoretically follow this simple process of Googling, observing, and copying. But, to reduce wasted budget, use a tool like Semrush. It’ll help you understand the demand and cost for profitable keywords. Bonus: Here’s a link to a 14-day trial on a Semrush Pro subscription. That should give you enough time to plan your search marketing campaigns. The first thing to do is check the keyword data. Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool shows that pendulum lights are searched 320 times a month. And the CPC is $0.77. This is enough data to test a campaign. But if you want even more validation, spy on your competitor’s ads. Following the breadcrumbs of how your competitors do ads can save you months of time and money. Staying with the lighting example, Lumens is a competitor. According to Semrush’s Advertising Research tool, Lumens is attracting over 27k monthly users from ads. This tells us that they’re investing pretty aggressively in Google Ads. And they’ve likely done the work of testing and failing. To validate this, you can check Lumens ads history. For instance, they’ve been bidding on “outdoor wall lighting” for seven months straight. Meaning: they’re seeing enough sales to continue the campaign. You can see what the ad looks like in Semrush. And Lumens has been tweaking their copy each month. Using this data drastically increases your chances of successful ads.

Cut what doesn’t. Every dollar should drive immediate sales (paid) or build long-term assets (organic). The top brands drive 30-50% of their revenue through email marketing. These email programs succeed by connecting three foundations we’ve covered: But there’s a fourth element that ties everything together: systematic execution. Let’s explore how to build an email program that turns subscribers into customers—and customers into repeat buyers. Note: The best practices I’m about to share are inspired by Boyuan Zhao, an email and SMS consultant for Shopify brands. I recommend checking out his free four-hour training on YouTube. It’s some of the best content I’ve seen on email marketing. Your email list isn’t just a number. “Most brands obsess over list size. But I’ve found that smaller, engaged lists consistently outperform massive, unengaged ones.” – Boyuan Zhao Large lists built through aggressive tactics (giveaways, lead magnets, etc.) often convert at 1-2%. Meanwhile, carefully grown lists using targeted pop-ups and organic signups can hit 8-15% conversion rates. The math is simple: Plus, better engagement means higher deliverability. Which means more of your emails actually reach inboxes. Start by optimizing your signup forms: Further reading: Email Marketing: The Definitive Guide You likely have a decent welcome series, abandoned cart emails, and a newsletter. But to hit 50% attributed revenue to email, you need to think differently. There are two shifts you need to make this happen. “The brands consistently driving 50% of revenue through email aren’t doing anything revolutionary. They’re just incredibly systematic about execution.” – Boyuan Zhao This means: The results compound over time. How many emails are in your sequences? Probably too many. “I’ve found that a well-executed 3-email sequence often outperforms complex 10-email flows. It’s not about the number of touchpoints. It’s about delivering the right message at the right time.” – Boyuan Zhao Instead of building complex automations, focus on the fundamentals: Weave authentic brand storytelling into your automations and relentlessly test, test, test. Do this, and you’re well on your way to more sales. Even if you have winning products and amazing marketing, you can fail if your operations suck. In 2023, founders Raquel and Adam Bouris of fragrance brand Who Is Elijah learned two expensive lessons about business. First, their discovery set promotion seemed like a slam dunk: sell fragrance samples for $1 plus shipping. They sold 6,000 sets in 24 hours. “Sales looked great because thousands and thousands a week were going out.” – Adam Bouris But the math told a different story. Customers paid $1 plus $10 shipping. The actual shipping cost was $7-12 per unit. Add production, logistics, and overhead costs. The result? A 60% loss on every order. Ouch. “We would’ve been better off turning the website off.” – Adam Bouris Meanwhile, their team had grown from 28 to 44 people, but profits weren’t following. Their initial approach followed conventional wisdom: Despite growing revenue, operational costs were suffocating the business. “One of the biggest problems founders make is they worry about the now instead of what’s on the other side of that decision. We were hiring people to fix problems six months away. That’s so stupid.” – Adam Bouris Who Is Elijah made a complete operational reset, including two critical changes: Profitability improved. They also became more agile and innovative. “I learned how to be a CFO the hard way, but I’m glad that I went through the pain.” – Adam Bouris You can build efficient operations without an MBA or years of corporate experience. It starts with digging into four areas. To understand your profitability create a system for tracking your unit economics. Start with the three numbers that matter most: 1. Revenue per order 2. Direct costs per order 3. Operating costs per order This is a starting point. The rest of your numbers (tools, complex calculations, etc.) can come later. Pro tip: Use a tool like Cin7 to automate this tracking. The investment pays for itself by identifying profit leaks. When problems arise, the tendency is to: Instead, step back and design systems that prevent future issues. Start with your three most time-consuming processes, e.g., order fulfillment, customer services, and inventory management. For each process: Your supply chain impacts everything: cash flow, customer satisfaction, and profitability. Here’s how to optimize it: First, map your current supply chain: Then, negotiate better terms. Here’s an email template: Hi [Name], We’ve been working together for [X months/years] and have purchased [$ amount] of inventory during this time. I’d like to discuss ways we can grow our partnership. Specifically, I’d like to explore: 1. Volume-based discounts 2. Extended payment terms (Net-30 or Net-60) 3. Priority shipping/fulfillment Could we schedule a quick call next week? Best, [Your name] Before adding employees, see what tasks you can automate. Here are some processes to tackle first: You don’t need to do everything at once. Start by answering these questions: Pick the area that needs the most work. Focus there first.

The future of renewable energy projects appears to be less likely to receive the level of government ... [+] support from the incoming Trump administration, making the biggest successes in the sector more diversified energy companies and organizations offering new, innovative solutions. (Photo by Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images) As the global energy landscape evolves, investors must assess the stability of traditional fossil fuels against the growth potential of renewable energy and advanced nuclear technologies. Some experts highlight a rising global backlash against renewables, as increasing evidence in Europe and elsewhere raises questions about long-term profitability and sustainability without government largesse. Others argue that addressing climate change is non-negotiable, making renewables a safe investment. This article also reflects the expected revival of the nuclear industry. Though national governments typically influence energy policy with input from international organizations such as the International Energy Agency, private enterprise drives energy industry innovation and development. Energy companies have the unique task of balancing public input, global diplomacy, and international frameworks with economic advantage. Companies without a clear, politically informed global outlook and communications and public affairs strategy cannot succeed in the energy sector. We looked at a mix of large, medium, and small-cap companies. Share prices quoted are the adjusted closing prices listed on January 2, 2024, and December 31, 2024, per Yahoo Finance historical lookups. The author has no direct interest in any of the companies highlighted here. Finally, past performance is no prediction of future results. Hydrocarbons – Best Performers TPL (Texas Pacific Land Corporation): TPL is a major landowner in Texas, with extensive holdings in the Permian Basin, home to one of North America’s largest oil and gas deposits. TPL seeks to partner in facilitating every aspect of developing the Basin’s resources through its Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations divisions. TPL’s stock increased by 111%, from $524.15 to $1105.96. TPL joined the S&P 500 in November 2024, replacing Marathon Oil. Its royalty-based model includes exposure to U.S. shale production, which is expected to grow under the Trump administration without significant capital expenditures. TRGP (Targa Resources): Targa Resources provides midstream infrastructure for supply of natural gas and natural gas liquids, or NGLs (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) for the domestic and global markets. It is the largest gatherer and processor in the Permian, with pipeline transport, fractionation, and shipping capacities. Its integrated systems and strategic positioning create steady revenue streams amidst strong North American production. After experiencing a remarkable 111% growth from $84.51 to $178.50 in 2024, the stock is set to keep climbing, supported by the company’s infrastructure investments. WMB (The Williams Companies): The Williams Companies provides transport, storage and delivery for natural gas, handling approximately one-third of the U.S. natural gas supply. Assets include pipelines and gathering and processing operations. Its fee-based contracts help maintain stable earnings, support long-term growth, resist shocks, and provide investors with dependable returns. During 2024, the stock grew steadily by 59%, from $34.00 to $54.12, and stands to continue growing in an environment more supportive of natural gas infrastructure. American oil and natural gas, infrastructure saw a boost due to likely support from the president ... [+] elect and its role in transporting these resources to countries wanting to buy from the U.S. (Photo by Rebecca DROKE / AFP) (Photo by REBECCA DROKE/AFP via Getty Images) Hydrocarbons – Worst Performers KOS (Kosmos Energy): Kosmos Energy is focused on deepwater exploration and production in offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as Mauritania and Senegal. The company is carrying significant debt, which may have contributed to Kosmos stepping back from preliminary plans to acquire London-based Tullow Oil in December 2024, though both companies are involved in developing the Jubilee field in Ghana (Kosmos has a 38.6% stake; Tullow a 38.9% stake). KOS shares drifted down during 2024, starting at $6.73 and ending at $3.42 for a 49% decrease. TLW.L (Tullow Oil): Tullow Oil, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, operates mainly in Africa and encountered operational challenges, including tax disputes. These issues contributed to underperformance and inconsistent shareholder returns. The stock plummeted 44% from £38.28 at the start of the year to £21.44 by year-end. With the potential Kosmos Energy takeover having fallen through, and with reduced but still significant debt, the stock’s future remains uncertain, with CEO Rahul Dhir having announced his intent to resign in 2025. APA (APA Corporation): A well-established firm in the field, in the near term APA Corporation faces potential cost overruns and project delays as well as possible damage to its reputation through a planned pullout from North Sea production by 2029 necessitated by UK emission regulations. Despite its geographical diversity, it has not yet achieved consistent profitability from its international projects. Operations in Egypt are only just recovering from a production slump, and uncertainty remains regarding the start of production for its Suriname project. This mixed picture led to a 33.9% decrease from $34.91 to $23.09 in 2024. Renewable and Clean(er) Energy – Best Performers VGAS (Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.): A development-stage company, Verde converts natural gas and biomass into gasoline or methanol and is also developing technology to mitigate gas flaring during oil production, using it instead to produce “30% less carbon intensive gas from gasoline”. While this technology-based approach is still proving its worth, the confidence fueled by consistent reductions in losses by 44.9% per year and a recent investment from Cottonmouth Ventures continued to drive the stock’s momentum. In 2024, the stock price increased by 75.76%, rising from $2.31 to $4.06. GEV (GE Vernova): American legacy giant GE finalized the spinoff of the energy company GE Vernova on April 1, 2024, and changed its own name to GE Aerospace, keeping the original GE ticker symbol, with GEV shares closing at an adjusted $141.91. On December 31, 2024, the adjusted close was $328.93, a 131.78% increase. With an established record as a global player in the electrification and power generation fields, areas of concentration include energy (gas, hydro, nuclear and steam), wind (offshore and onshore), Electrification (grid solutions, solar storage, etc.), and Accelerators (including R&D projects). WAVE (Eco Wave Power): Eco Wave Power utilizes tidal power, harnessing ocean waves for electricity generation. This technology broadens the renewable mix beyond intermittent sources like wind and solar and allows for power generation where infrastructure could not typically be constructed, offering additional clean power sources. As a novel technology, with a tiny market cap ($64M), Eco Wave saw more explosive growth than its renewable counterparts, rising an extreme 628.48% from $1.51 to $11.00 in 2024. Renewable Energy – Worst Performers ENPH (Enphase Energy): Enphase Energy, a leader in solar microinverters, faced declining revenue, workforce restructuring, and competitive pressures from Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, resulting in weaker financial performance and a significant 47.6% drop in its stock value from $131.24 to $68.68. NEP (NextEra Energy Partners): NextEra Energy Partners focuses on renewable energy projects, had suspension of distribution growth and a change in its growth drivers, moving from acquisitions toward repowering wind turbines, leading to declining investor confidence despite a strong 2Q 2024 report and significant stock underperformance, represented by a 33.6% price drop from $26.81 to $17.80. BEP (Brookfield Renewable Partners): Brookfield Renewable Partners, a global leader in renewable energy, experienced underperformance due to fluctuations in currency values between USD and CAD, along with regulatory uncertainties as the Trump administration is set to take office. This situation affected investor confidence and hindered its stock performance during 2024. The stock’s price dropped a modest 8% overall, starting at $24.92 and ending at $22.79. Nuclear Stocks – Best Performers NNE (NANO Nuclear Energy): Nano Nuclear Energy, a developer of advanced microreactor technologies like the ZEUS reactor, saw strong stock growth driven by technological advancements, strategic partnerships to secure access to enriched uranium, and increased visibility within the nuclear energy sector. Since its May 8, 2024, IPO, closing at $5.19, the stock’s price has grown 379.77% to $24.90. SMR (NuScale Power Corporation): NuScale Power, an emerging leader in small modular reactors, has seen strong stock growth fueled by technological innovation, global strategic partnerships, and regulatory support for clean energy solutions in the nuclear sector through measures like the ADVANCE Act, which appear to remain consistent with the incoming Trump administration. This rapid demand growth and regulatory backing resulted in an explosive increase of 471 % as the stock price surged from $3.14 to $17.93 this year. CEG (Constellation Energy): Albeit using natural gas, not just renewables, Constellation Energy excels in clean energy, bolstered by strategic partnerships, a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Microsoft, and rising demand for nuclear power, driving strong performance and growth in the energy sector. This translated into a price growth of $115.25 to $223.71 for Constellation, a 94.11% increase. Data centers and the growth of AI are driving demand for nuclear energy. The Three Mile Island ... [+] plant, shown here, is set to be recommissioned by Constellation Energy, bolstered by a purchasing agreement with Microsoft. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Nuclear Stocks – Worst Performers UUUU (Energy Fuels Inc.) Energy Fuels Inc. is a uranium mining company with operations spanning the supply chain. Despite a major roadblock that had stopped its Madagascar operations from moving forward since 2019 being finally resolved, the stock experienced weakness throughout the year, with a 25.87% drop in stock price from $6.92 to $5.13. CCJ (Cameco Corporation) Nuclear fuel products and services provider Cameco only saw modest growth despite high demand for nuclear generation, only rising 22% from $42.04 to $51.39, underperforming S&P 500. This is likely due to the stock coming off of a sharp price increase in uranium in 2023 driven by geopolitical factors to a more stable price in 2024. LEU (Centrus Energy Corporation) Centrus Energy, a supplier of nuclear fuel components and services for the nuclear fuel industry, “only” grew by 26%, increasing from $52.85 to $66.61, following a weak Q3 and skepticism regarding nuclear growth after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a deal between Amazon and Talen Energy in November 2024.

Semiconductor chip stocks rose on Monday after electronics giant Foxconn (HNHPF-3.17%) reported record-breaking revenue for its fourth quarter, as the artificial intelligence boom continues into 2025. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Sunday reported revenue of $2.13 trillion in New Taiwan dollars ($65 billion) for the October to December period. Despite revenue falling month-over-month in November and December, the world’s largest electronics maker recorded growth in each month compared to a year earlier. That gave the company a 15% year-over-year increase, a record for the major Apple supplier. In a statement, Foxconn cited “strong demand” for AI servers, new computing products, and growth in its automotive-related business. Foxconn has started developing its own business around electric vehicles and has plans for a major campus in Zhengzhou, China, also known as “iPhone City. Its computing products division also showed “strong growth” driven by demand for new products, while its smart consumer electronics division slightly declined due to production issues. “In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,” Foxconn said. The company added that the quarter should show “significant growth” compared to the same time in 2024. Shares of semiconductor companies across the world rose on the news of Foxconn’s revenue and first-quarter forecast, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces about 90% of the world’s chips. TSMC (TSM+0.60%) stock rose almost 5% in pre-market trading in New York, adding to its major rally in 2024. Nvidia stock was up more than 2% in early trading, building on its own supersized gains in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-5.06%) stock rose by almost 3%, while Intel (INTC-3.55%) shares ticked up slightly by 1% and Synopsys (SNPS-1.88%) shares climbed 2% in pre-market trading. The Netherlands-based ASML’s (ASML-0.61%) stock was up almost 6%, while Switzerland’s STMicroelectronics (STM-2.57%) saw its shares climb by almost 7%. Other European companies, including ASMI (ASMIY-0.83%) and Infineon (IFNNY-1.69%), also saw gains. Shares in South Korean’s SK Hynix (HXSCL) and Samsung rose by almost 10% and 3%, respectively.

WASHINGTON, DC - The dome of the U.S. Capitol is seen beyond a snow man on the national mall on ... [+] January 16, 2024. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Much ink (or in today’s world, electrons and pixels), has been expended discussing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to be formed in the incoming Presidential administration. Popularly known as “DOGE” and headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the moniker is a not so subtle reference to a cryptocurrency supported by Musk. The Doge was also, in medieval times, the chief magistrate of city-states such as Venice and Genoa, and acted as a judge to decide questions brought before a court of justice. DOGE will not be a department, but actually an advisory commission, of which there are many serving various Departments of the US government. (Most of these, doubtlessly, will be targets for elimination by the commission). To be an actual Department, such as Defense or Treasury, would require an act of Congress. However, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) announced plans in November of last year to form a Subcommittee to work with DOGE to achieve its goals. This Subcommittee will be chaired by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). The two tech billionaires leading DOGE have at various times announced multiple goals and actions. Musk has put forth the expectation that the Federal budget would be reduced by $2 Trillion. Ramaswamy has stated that entire Departments might be eliminated and as much as three quarters of the Federal workforce could be let go. Musk has proposed eliminating over 300 of the 400 plus Federal agencies. It is not hard to determine how the $2 Trillion reduction goal was set. The 2024 Federal budget was roughly $6.8 Trillion in overall spending while revenues (derived primarily from personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, custom duties and sales/excise taxes) was only $4.9 Trillion, yielding a $1.9 Trillion annual budget deficit. And that deficit is expected to grow, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to $2.6 Trillion by 2034. In other words, if DOGE could achieve its goals, the budget would be balanced, something that has not occurred since 2001, regardless of the political party in power. Pres. Ronald Reagan walking & giving thumbs up gesture on S. Lawn after returning from MA. (Photo ... [+] by Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images) Despite the aggressive pronouncements, the reality of reducing government spending through blue-ribbon advisory commissions dates back to Theodore Roosevelt, with little sustained impact. Most notable in the recent past was Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission, led by industrial CEO Peter Grace. In 1982, Reagan coined the phrase “Drain the Swamp” and encouraged the Commission to “Be bold... work like tireless bloodhounds... Don’t leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.” The Grace Commission produced a 47 volume report that, if implemented, promised a reduction of Federal spending of nearly half a trillion dollars in three years and a paring of the national debt by over $10 Trillion over the next sixteen years. At the end of last year, that debt now sits at $36.22 Trillion. Most of the findings were never enacted due to policy disputes or bureaucratic resistance. Although past commissions might not have achieved their aims, the financial markets are betting otherwise. From the date of the election, November 5, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the stock price of government services providers has slid by as much as 31%. These companies, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Amentum, CACI, SAIC, Leidos, V2X, Parsons and KBR perform a variety of technical, engineering, or IT services to perform projects in support of Departmental goals. Many of them provide qualified manpower to work on classified projects, having the necessary security clearances. Their revenue is often highly correlated with their qualified employees, and are referred to as “butts in seats” enterprises. HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN - JULY 21: KBR (UK) employees work at a manufacturing plant at the ... [+] Camp Bastion Water Bottling Plant on July 21, 2008. (Photo by Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images) And the falloff in enterprise value has induced second order effects. In late December it was revealed that KBR was a target of an activist investor, Irenic Capital, which had accumulated over 1% of the company’s shares and was advocating for a split of the government services unit from the private sector services unit due to the slower expected growth rate of the former. Irenic estimated that shareholder value could be improved by 50% through such a separation. It is understandable that these companies could experience a drastic slowdown in their revenues. They are engaged on projects which can be delayed or cancelled perhaps more easily and rapidly than cutting Federal employees. When Musk took over Twitter (now renamed X) in 2022, he took the workforce from 8,000 to 1,500, according to statements he made in 2023, or a reduction of roughly 80%. Despite fears that the company’s systems would crash, they continued to function albeit in a reduced form (a subject of continuing controversy), and that realization set off a chain reaction in Silicon Valley. Almost instantly, the tech CEO mindset changed from one of scarcity and competition for talent (providing housing, transportation, in-office amenities such as food, coffee baristas and kombucha on tap) to attract qualified software engineers, to one of surplus and excess. Companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple slashed over 165,000 jobs in 2022, 263,000 in 2023 and 151,000 in 2024, according to layoffs.fyi. However successful the cost cutting was, X’s market value has now dropped to $9.4 Billion (according to Fidelity Investments) versus the $44 Billion Musk paid for it, due to dissatisfaction with its policies and performance and defections of advertisers and users to other social media platforms. And this is the conundrum that every would be drainer of swamps must face. The “excess” cost that must be eliminated has a sponsor or recipient of its value - many of whom sit in a Congress that has razor slim majorities in its parties. DOGE may not achieve any or all of its goals in reality. The means by which the $2 Trillion reduction is measured is not specified (annually? over time? inflation adjusted?) and it is unclear whether other spending will be needed to offset backlash from affected parties (the Twitter/X problem). But for now the specter of reduced government spending is having a material impact in the expectations of the financial markets for the providers of government services.

Plus: How Jay Graber Is Making Sure Social Media Upstart Bluesky Never Turns Into Elon Musk’s X Good morning, Tesla isn’t the only EV maker experiencing a post-election rally. Shares of California-based Rivian rallied to one of their best days ever on Friday, surging 24%. The upward trajectory defies initial Wall Street concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s reported intention to cut a federal subsidy for electric vehicles. But last week the automaker revealed slightly better fourth-quarter car deliveries than analysts expected. Rivian’s stock is up 54% since election day, outperforming every other stock besides Tesla and Palantir. The purchase of most Rivian vehicles qualifies for a $3,750 federal tax credit, but if Trump repeals such a subsidy, it could hurt EV demand and effectively increase the sticker price. A FedEx Corp. cargo jet sits parked in the snow at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on January 5, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. Winter Storm Blair swept across the U.S. Central Plains and Midwest Sunday and toward Washington, D.C. Monday, disrupting more than 10,000 flights and counting as heavy snow, ice and wind have made for hazardous travel conditions. Tens of millions across the mid-Atlantic are under winter weather warnings through Tuesday morning. Official merchandise themed for Donald Trump's inauguration may do more than celebrate his second presidency—the funds from such swag could be used to cover Trump’s personal expenses, including legal fees, based on fine print displayed at the bottom of checkout pages. It’s an unusual diversion, campaign finance experts told Forbes. Bitcoin reached an all-time high in 2024, capturing the attention of the world and of one old-school value investor. Here's why Taesik Yoon, a longtime Forbes editor, says he’s bullish on the volatile cryptocurrency, and that continued adoption is key. Ed Stack, executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods, in the Dick's "House of Sport" in Pittsburgh's Ross Park Mall. Dick’s Sporting Goods owner Ed Stack turned his father’s small business into a juggernaut with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. He attributes his business success to a series of lessons learned along the way, including to always keep score, study great leaders, pursue a passion and stick to your principles. Billionaire Fernando De Leon’s conglomerate Leon Capital Group is estimated to be worth nearly $3 billion, but growing up, he lived in poverty in Mexico and crossed the U.S. border daily to go to school in Texas. “I’m what Donald Trump calls an ‘anchor baby,’” he says, “but a high tax-paying anchor baby.” Roughly a quarter of De Leon’s estimated $2.8 billion fortune is now in residential and industrial real estate, mostly in growing Sun Belt cities. London-based payments unicorn Checkout was once the most valuable startup in Europe, with a $40 billion valuation, but its revenues have slumped after cutting its contract with Binance over money laundering concerns. The troubled crypto exchange at one point was Checkout’s largest customer, and corporate filings reveal the London-based fintech’s revenues dropped 16% to $212 million. The House voted Friday to reelect Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as their Speaker after a tight contest following pushback from a small but influential group of Republicans. President-elect Donald Trump endorsed Johnson earlier in the week and reportedly spoke to several members who wound up changing their votes. Trump’s guilty verdict on 34 felony counts in New York will stand after a judge ruled against throwing out the verdict, keeping one of the only remaining criminal cases against Trump alive. Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration, but made clear he does not plan to sentence Trump to any prison time. The president-elect criticized the decision on social media over the weekend, saying no president had ever been treated “so evilly and illegally,” and denouncing the New York judicial system. President-elect Donald Trump indicated his continued support for TikTok last week, but his incoming administration’s ability to stop or even pause the federal ban is limited. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the TikTok case this Friday, and it’s expected they’ll issue a quick ruling on whether or not the law should be upheld by the time it’s due to take effect January 19. After much back and forth, the Corporate Transparency Act could be headed to the Supreme Court after the Department of Justice filed an application to overturn a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the government from enforcing beneficial ownership information reporting. It’s meant a lot of whiplash for business owners and advisors about whether or not they need to report, and if so, when—but the status quo for now continues to be wait-and-see. Kimberly White/Stringer/Getty Images TOPLINE Since Elon Musk torpedoed Twitter, its rival Bluesky has seen a stunning surge. Bluesky began as an open source research project at Twitter helmed by open internet evangelist Jay Graber. Graber’s mandate was to build a protocol, a shared language that computers could use to talk to each other, designed specifically for social media. But after Elon Musk bought Twitter, it became clear that Bluesky was no longer on its roadmap. The platform began to transform, facing an advertiser boycott, exodus of users, and eventually a name change to X. So the team that made the protocol spun up a quick app, just to show how it might be used. They launched it as an invite-only social network in 2023. Since its launch, Bluesky has seen unusual success: It raised a modest $15 million Series A round in October, when it had 13 million users, and since then, its user base has nearly doubled to more than 25 million. The app has panicked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose own Twitter competitor, Threads, has rushed to copy many of its features. But Bluesky is a company with investors who want to make money. And that could someday clash with Graber’s user-first approach to social media: To put the people using Bluesky in control of its central features. In giving power to the people, Bluesky has so far eschewed the strategy that other social platforms have used to make billions of dollars: collecting troves of intimate data about their users, and then letting advertisers target them based on that data. At least today, Bluesky is fully public, and its user data is available to people outside the company, so there’s no secret sauce for advertisers to pay for. WHY IT MATTERS “If Bluesky’s model is successful and other companies adopt Graber's protocol, it could change the future of social media,” says Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva. “Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter illustrated how fragile the social media ecosystem can be. Decentralizing it can be a form of ‘billionaire-proofing’ the medium, as Graber puts it, for the long term.” MORE How Elon Musk Muzzled Government Employees From Talking About xAI’s New Supercomputer Shares of alcohol makers and distributors fell Friday after Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to update warning labels on alcoholic beverages to include cancer risks. Alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer behind tobacco and obesity, according to Murthy: Around $450 million: The amount of market capitalization that the producer of Modelo and Corona beers lost after the announcement Only 45%: The share of American adults who know of the possible cancer risks of alcohol 100,000: The estimated number of annual alcohol-related cancer cases in the U.S. The job market is at a crossroads, and it’s critical for workers to be resilient and adaptable. A few key labor market trends to watch out for in 2025 include the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, a full return to the office at some companies and the growing practice of skills-based hiring. There is also more demand for skilled trades, which is opening up new opportunities and challenging long-held assumptions about career success.

Title: How I Keep our Big Family Grocery Budget Low

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting January 6, 2025 by Laura 1 Comment This is how I keep our big family grocery budget low… Perhaps when you see our large grocery budget number, you don’t see it as a low number. It’s all relative, right? It is large for a regular-sized family. But for our big family? I think we do a pretty good job of keeping it as low as we can. Aww, a look at our beloved 19: We are so grateful to live close to Asa, Eva, and Arrow and Justus, Kelsey, and Little Sweetheart! Our budget for 2024 was $1,400/month. You can see the total numbers here sharing what each month looked like. You might notice if you divide my total 2024 spending amount by 12 months that I actually averaged a bit lower per-month amount than I budgeted. As I look ahead to 2025, I’m looking at how it worked to maintain that budget plus I’m considering these… I still plan to keep our grocery budget at $1,400/month right now and see how long that works for us. I will make adjustments during the year if this doesn’t work or if it is causing stress. Our energy and mental space needs to be used to care for our family and others – not for crunching numbers and worrying over nickels and dimes. I’ve been thinking about all that is working for me as I try to stick to a healthy grocery budget for our household and I came up with a lot of details to share! After settling into our new Lincoln home and finding my way with new-to-me grocery stores and a new shopping system that works for our needs, this is what I’ve found that works to feed 13 of us with a $1,400/month budget. 1. I always look for meat markdowns. Buying discounted meat is probably what saves our family the most money on groceries. I settled on this price point for meat, and I am determined to almost never go over. See the exception here. But with this in mind, I have found that if I look for meat that has been marked down for quick sale – specifically at Aldi, Walmart, or Sam’s – I can almost always buy meat for our family marked down to $2.50/pound or less. This is even less than my price point, and the savings are huge! These yellow stickers are my favorite! And I’ve found that if I shop in the mornings, that’s when there are the most yellow stickers as the stores clear out their packages of meat that are nearing the “best by” date. I grab them up and freeze them to use as needed. HUGE SAVINGS. The best mark down I’ve found: for two years in a row, we’ve scored $0.50/pound ham after Christmas. We fill our freezers. One ham goes a long way, even for a large family! Every once in a while, other stores in town (that I don’t frequent regularly) will offer a big meat sale. If the deals are good, I find it worth it to make an extra stop to take advantage. 2. We shop in bulk. Having a Sam’s or Costco membership may not pay for itself for some families. But for us? The savings are big and very worth it. I now know which items are priced best at Sam’s, which are best at Costco, and which are better at other stores. Buying large quantities of many of our staples cuts down our cost and is also helpful for my planning needs. It takes a lot of mental pressure off my brain if I know that I have twelve of something in my pantry ready to grab as needed. It usually takes two carts to get everything we need at Costco or Sam’s each month. 3. I have learned what items are cheapest at which stores. After living in Lincoln for a year-and-a-half, I’ve learned which prices are best at which store for the products we use and need. My favorite places to shop are Sam’s, Costco, and Aldi with a little Walmart thrown in for those awesome meat markdowns! Typically, I keep running lists on my phone of what I need at each store. I shop once each week, but go to a different store each time. So usually we hit Costco and Sam’s just once in a month, Aldi twice and Walmart twice. This works well for our budget and plans! 4. We eat as many fruits and veggies as we can. People don’t believe me when I say that fruits and veggies save money because everyone thinks “healthy food is expensive.” I disagree when it comes to fruits and veggies. Where we shop, apples, bananas, carrots, pears, grapes, fresh spinach, mixed greens, and potatoes are all consistently low in price per pound. Frozen fruits and veggies cost the same all year round. And we buy everything else in season when their prices are the lowest and featured in a sale. Kids need something to hold them over until lunch? Here’s an apple: Also, I’ve found that it’s easiest to feed a large crowd of people (which for us is 13 to 30 or more people per meal) when I set out the main dish and a variety of fruit and/or veggie side dish options. This stretches the meal to feed a lot of people, plus offers variety, gives people choices, and overall saves money. 5. I say yes to offers of free food that would otherwise go to waste. Say what? Well, we stand out as a large family with “a lot of mouths to feed.” Therefore, people often think of us when there is extra food that will get thrown away after an event at church or at people’s places of work. Our neighbor is often stopping by with something from his work’s break room that is perfectly good to eat but is about to get tossed because no one wants it. “Wait! I’ll take it to the Coppingers!” says he, and he does. After a potluck or church event? People hand us leftovers. “Here, use this for your next Sunday lunch,” they’ll say. Or, “Will your family eat this? We hate to throw it away.” YEP. We say yes to most offers like this because we don’t like food going in the trash and because I can make a meal with just about anything if I get creative. In addition, we bring home food from the Food Distribution site where we volunteer each week. All the food there is donated by grocery stores and restaurants if it is an item close to its expiration date or otherwise unable to be sold. This food is going to be thrown away if not given to the community! I can’t tell you how grateful we are that Lincoln has the FoodNet program to cut down on food waste and to provide for the community instead. Typically each week at the location where we serve, over 100 families go through the line to get food. We, as volunteers, get to pick out some of the food too if there is enough. And at the end of the hour when all of the clients have gone through the line, if there is anything left, volunteers can go through the line again. We bring home a random assortment of food each week – sometimes just a little and sometimes several bags worth. I usually need to find ways to use up this food or freeze it pretty quickly because it’s food that is on its last leg. But it was free and it’s fun and it didn’t go into a grocery store dumpster. Worth noting: sometimes I say yes to food handouts even if I know our family won’t eat it because I know people who will eat it. We regularly buy extra or stockpile food we’ve been given to take to our church’s Little Free Pantry. It’s so good for our kids to be a part of the ministry of caring for others and loving people in our neighborhood. Almost every time we are at the pantry filling it up, we meet up with someone who is coming there to check for food to use for their next meal. It’s amazing and we love visiting with these new friends. 6. WIC Our three youngest kids qualify for WIC through their adoption subsidy (and will until they turn five). This gives them fresh produce, cheese, eggs, milk, rice/pasta/bread, and beans and totals around $150/month in benefits. This is a lovely resource we are thankful to enjoy for our kids. 7. I only buy organic if it fits into the budget. I used to overthink this and feel guilty. But God has taken this guilt away though because He’s taught me that loving people is much more important than obsessing over food. Yes, I want to take good care of our bodies. I absolutely try to fill us all with nourishing foods every day. But my focus is more on meeting our kids’ emotional needs than worrying over an organic label on our food. We also want to continue to fill our home and tables with dear friends who join us for meals frequently. We want to feed our guests well, but spending extra to be sure everything is organic would not work for our budget. I won’t trade an organic label for inviting people into our home to share our food. I’m thankful that many organic foods DON’T cost more – like apples, spinach, mixed greens, salsa, pasta sauce, and carrots. I get them regularly and other organic items if I can. But if I buy pears that aren’t organic, I’m no longer worried. We’re still eating pears. Pears are healthy. God takes care of the rest. 8. We always eat at home or pack food if we’re on the road. Buying restaurant food is not an option for us right now, and we are very ok with that. ( Think eating out would double our grocery budget. Plus can you imagine taking this many high-need kids into a restaurant? Phew.) Instead, we’ve found all kinds of other ways to make food fun, to offer all of us treats, and to even pretend we are having fast food. (Bulk bags of chicken nuggets and fries from Costco are crazy cheap compared to feeding 13 people at Wendy’s – and they taste better too.) I’ve found so many ways to make food prep simple that I never feel like I want to order take-out. If I ever need a night off from cooking (which, of course, I do), we bake Costco frozen pizzas. They are super cheap compared to ordering pizza and we love how they taste. Costco or Sam’s $5 Rotisserie Chicken is also a great fast food option that goes a long way! Exception to never eating out: There are a few times each year that we find ourselves on the road with the need to stop and get a bunch of McDonald’s nuggets or something like this. We aren’t legalistic about not eating out. We just choose not to most of the time and enjoy coming up with all kinds of other fun options to eat or pack instead! 9. We eat leftovers. I mentioned above that we don’t like it when food goes to waste. Therefore, we put all of our leftovers from meals into our fridge to warm up another time. Matt and I are stay at home /work from home parents, and we almost always warm up leftovers for our lunch. Elias often packs leftovers to take to work for lunch. And whenever our fridge starts to get over full, instead of cooking something new, we have a meal in which we pull out all the leftovers and warm them up for people to help themselves to whatever sounds good. I’ve also found creative ways to turn leftover food into a brand new meal: like turning a Taco Bar into a casserole or a bunch of burritos for the freezer, taking leftover ham to make Ham and Potato Casserole or Breakfast Casserole. It’s pretty easy to turn leftovers into something new. 10. I make good use of our freezers. If there’s a good sale (or a good deal on meat, as if I haven’t talked about that enough, ha), I stock up and fill the freezer. If I’m making one casserole or batch of muffins, I often make two or three while I’m at it to get more meals prepped for the same amount of work. I put the extras into the freezer for a convenient fast food another day. Frozen casseroles/muffins/breads also give me the option of providing others with meals if I find out of a need – a sick friend, a new mama, or a hurting friend. 11. I use credit for Azure Standard purchases. This is only worth a tiny mention as it doesn’t affect our budget much. But I do accrue a small amount of referral credit to Azure Standard when any of you sign up for an account and/or take advantage of what Azure has to offer. About twice a year, the credit number adds up to enough for me to put in an order that is mostly covered by the credit. Their food is great and some of it I can only find through Azure, so these are the items I stock up on when I can! Stay tuned for our weekly posts to see what we’re eating and who we’re feeding. And watch for our monthly posts sharing what we buy and how much we spend. We’ll see if our monthly $1,400/month budget holds! What are the best ways you’ve found to save money at the grocery stores where you live? Filed Under: Big Family Food, Feeding the Family Tagged With: frugal budget, grocery budget, large family food, saving money on groceries Amber says January 7, 2025 at 5:45 pm That is a very good budget for the amount of people you feed. Do you use a separate budget for nonfood household items and needs or is it included. I have a family of 7 children (3 teens) and two adults. I am working keeping ours down and having more fruits and vegetables. My younger children tend to go through fruit in one day it seems like a bag of mandarins for instance. We are also a neurodivergent family. God Bless! Your email address will not be published.

Title: Meta Officially Discontinues Quest Pro, Its First (and most expensive) Mixed Reality Headset
URL: https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-discontinues-quest-pro/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T11:49:54Z
Full Content:
Meta has officially discontinued Quest Pro, the company’s first mixed reality headset. Meta announced back in September that it was winding down Quest 2 and Quest Pro sales. At the time, the company said remaining stock would be sold through the end of the year or until they ran out, whichever came first. Now, in place of the Quest Pro order page, Meta is suggesting users to buy Quest 3 “for the ultimate mixed reality experience and premium comfort.” You can still buy Quest Pro’s ‘Touch Pro’ controllers however, as they support Quest 2 and above. Released in 2022 at the eye-water price of $1,500, Meta hoped to use the headset to kickstart its mixed reality ambitions among consumers, as it was the first to offer color-passthrough, pancake lenses, and both face and eye-tracking—coming in strong contrast to the company’s other offering at the time, Quest 2. Nearly a year after launch, it was apparent the Pro-level headset wasn’t appealing to users nearly to the degree Meta had initially hoped, prompting the company to knock Quest Pro down to $1,000. To complicate matters, high initial pricing of Quest Pro put a strain on developers, which resulted in very few compelling MR experiences out of the gate. It was clear what was needed was a more accessible headset. In October 2023, Meta released Quest 3, which housed much of the tech seen in Quest Pro—minus face and eye-tracking, and at the starting price of $499. Clamping down yet further on price-performance, Meta released Quest 3S a year later, which houses the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as Quest 3, although including the same cost-saving Fresnel lenses and displays as Quest 2—marking the company’s most energetic push to capitalize on its mixed reality ambitions. While Meta’s strategy to capture the console price-point with Quest has been a winning strategy thus far, what’s uncertain is whether the company will head back into the ‘Pro’ pricing structure anytime soon. The Information reported earlier last year that Meta was cancelling a potential Quest Pro follow-up, however Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth partically refuted those claims, noting that “there might be a Quest Pro 2, there might not be. I’m not really telling you, but I will say don’t believe everything you read about what’s been stopped or started.” This article may contain affiliate links.

To complicate matters, high initial pricing of Quest Pro put a strain on developers, which resulted in very few compelling MR experiences out of the gate. Of course. I don't understand why XR companies continue to learn the lesson the hard way. With Quest Pro, you could say that the device was not good enough. But now the Vision Pro, as good a device as you can get with today's tech, faces the same problem. PSVR2 almost died prematurely because of the same thing. "Make it desirable before it is affordable" has always been a stupid strategy. Meta's bottom-up approach is the only way. The reason is simple. Hardware need software to be "desirable" in the first place. And software development has adopted the business model of selling cheap copies to a large number of users. That means hardware designers don't really have a choice. The first question they need to ask is can we sell tens of millions of units. They stopped drinking the the Apple Kool Aid and escaped Apple's reality distortion field but now are really Jonesing that they didn't get some of that sexy eye-tracking! (Consumer) technology that was successful with a rather high price at the beginning, only affordable for a minority, but then used the money from that initial small, but lucrative market to improve tech and lower cost through both larger numbers and production cost reductions: PCs, laptops, telefones, mobile phones, smartphones, CD players, washing maschines, LED lighting, cars, power drills, tape recorder, VHS recorder, refrigerators, Walkman, laser printers, harddisks, SSD, beamer, microwave ovens… (Consumer) technology that became successful by pumping billions into it for more than a decade to push it into households without even making back a fraction of the investment:… And no, gaming consoles were sold with at least some profit for most of their existence, Nintendo never sold at a loss and Sony stopped doing so after the extremely expensive to produce PS3. I believe in XR, because I think that it is genuinely useful and will make people's lives better. But that is also the key to its mass adaption: it first has to become useful/usable (for some, then slowly) for the masses, like all the successful technologies listed above. Claiming that one billionaire's incredible expensive long term bet for more market control and money, enabled by his 60% of Meta's voting shares, would be the only viable approach, is completely ignoring how technology got established so far, blatently ignores the very limited active user numbers the highly subsidized USD 300 Quest collected for those billions, and replaces economic reasoning with wishful thinking. Palmer Luckey wrote a famous blog entry in 2018 titled "Free isn't cheap enough" about VR acceptance by most users. And it wasn't an opinion piece, but based on Oculus research that most people wouldn't use a VR HMD even if they got everything for free. With Quest we saw a ~40% retention rate, so 60% won't use a VR HMD they already paid for. Price is not the primary issue. USD 1500 would have been completely fine for a business oriented Quest Pro, if it had proven to be (sufficiently) useful for its official target audience. It just utterly failed to do so. All the items you mention to prove your point have one thing the Pro never had, enough consumers that wanted the product. That plus the price destroyed it. Only compounded by those low sales not encouraging devs to risk anything on making a killer app. Many of the products I listed could have only dreamt of the est. 50-100K unit sales during their first year that the Quest Pro generated. And there is a decent chance that Meta sold much more Quest Pro than Bigscreen sold Beyond or HTC sold Vive Focus 3. And that's fine, because these serve a niche audience with matching price calculations. But apparently not good enough for Meta. The Quest Pro's problem was that the concept was to create a professional HMD, but the only large enough use case they found was VR conferencing. And while the hardware was okay for that, the software wasn't anywhere near ready to make it actually useful. So almost nobody bought it for business use, and Meta tried to instead also sell it to gamers, where it offered very bad value. Had they clearly stated that gamers should wait for Quest 3, and also given the Pro the time and support that HTC gives their Pro HMDs, it might have found its niche, and established Quest for professional use, where service and reliability outweigh specs and price. But instead Meta dumped it once it didn't immediately deliver success/large numbers, like they did with several Go/Quest business programs before. Sometimes tech simply needs time to establish itself and then grow and mature from an initialy small use case snd user base, and trying to force it to grow faster will just fail. "Meta dumped it once it didn't immediately deliver success/large numbers, like they did with several Go/Quest business programs before." This is now standard corporate procedure now, i.e. Microsoft. Shareholders dislike the idea of niche markets now as corporate greed is the current working model. None of your examples are applicable. It is the symbiotic relationship between software and hardware that makes gaming consoles different from any "consumer electronics". The value of phones, PCs and laptops were clear even in the early days when there were just a few apps. On the other hand, the most common question you hear about the Vison Pro is "what do I do with it". A gaming console — in order to realize its entertainment value — needs a constant supply of games that are very expensive to develop but only have limited value for an individual. "Crowd funding" is the only viable business strategy. I am not saying you have to sell the consoles at a loss. Just do whatever you can to get them into as many hands as possible. Whenever I post whole lists of counter examples to show that your "we must force it into the market now" theories are not how technology is actually established, all I get is that none of them are applicable for unspecified reasons, because VR is somehow special, so known economic rules can't be applied. Also always ignoring that PCs and mobile phones started in the 70s, laptop in the 80s, with initially miniscule use cases and user numbers. Most people saw no practical use in buying one at all for literally decades. And people absolutely have an idea what to do with AVP, and be it only for watching movies. Just not at that weight and that price. How about you come up with examples where any company sucessfully established a technology that most customers at that time/state simply didn't care about, by just ruthlessly burning money for a decade? XR will succeed once it offers enough use for enough people, and until then it will do fine as a niche technology. The example is right in front of your eyes. It's called Quest 3S. It's sold more than PS5 and Xbox combined this holiday season. The kickstart process has completed. The Quest platform is now on a self-sustainable path. The reason Meta hasn't stopped pouring money is because it has bigger prizes in its sight. I don’t know if the path is self-sustainable, though. No one’s arguing that the Quest is the dominant VR platform. Given how much money Meta has put into it, it would be weird if it weren’t. But it’s not clear to me that Meta’s place in the market is so solid that they can’t be dethroned if they turn off the money hose. I have a large library of games on their store thanks to a referral system that I and others frankly abused for hundreds of dollars in free games, but if someone released a better headset and store, it wouldn’t stop me from switching. I might hang onto the Quest until I was bored with those games, but I would still switch. The real driver of sustainable XR adoption in the future is going to be everyday AR, and I’m not convinced that Meta is going to win that battle, or that their $100B investment into the opening act of gaming-focused VR is going to pay off. They’ve been very good at hardware design and aggressive pricing, but their leadership decisions (like the Quest Pro) show a lack of vision, and Meta’s AR efforts are tied to Microsoft, whose software efforts haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory lately. I don't know if Meta will be the eventual winner, but that's a different question. VR gaming is here to stay regardless because a large number of studios have found their footing in this industry thanks mostly to the Meta platform. Whether Meta will cede this ground to another company in the future or not, those developer will still be here with their accumulated knowledge and established reputation. Working with Microsoft ensures failure because as soon as they don't see a 300% on their investment in a couple quarters they will completely pull out. The 2024 Quest 3S may have outsold the four year old PS5 in North America (Xbox sales are way lower, esp. internationally), but the PS5 reached 68mn in lifetime sales by 2024-11, leaving Quest 1/2/3S/3/Pro combined far behind, with much higher retention and follow-up game sales. And while Quest 3S sold better than Quest 3/Pro before (SUCCESS!!!), it sold less than its aging 2020 predecessor sold on Amazon during the 2023 holiday season. I'm fully aware why Meta keeps pouring money into XR, and what bigger prizes they are eying for. It's just very obvious that all their effort so far hasn't gotten them anywhere near to where their platform might be considered a potential threat to the Apple/Google mobile duopoly that those players will inevitably try to extend into XR by leveraging their huge user bases. And time is mostly working against Meta. It's been a threat to Apple and Google enough that they both decided they could not sit on the sidelines anymore. Pretty sure that AndroidXR is mostly a reaction to visionOS, and AVP mostly Tim Cook's decade long attempt to proof that he too can come up with revolutionary products, so his legacy won't be limited to "the great accountant that turned Apple into the first trillion dollar company." Doubt that Meta had a lot to do with it, if anything the lacking mass market acceptance of Quest showed them they didn't need to hurry. Yes but even apple who usually have a good sense and is able to create new trends, sort of didn't met it's usual standards. It seems the potential that enthousiasts see in VR isn't translating well to mortals yet. Sort of like how only nerds, scientists and army could see the point of the first computers. But the actual reality is maybe that it's not even sure that you could jump start a VR market right now by giving headsets away for free and releasing a HL Alyx type of game every month. The issue seems more and more a slow human paradigm shift to vr, than technical or financial reasons. Just think how many of us refused to use cell phones. I could have stayed without one for a long time if there was no sign I was about to be excluded naturaly of social activities. Is there something similar that is forcing people to VR yet ? No, not yet, but I think in maybe 10 or 20 years, something similair will start to happen probably. Well, if you believe human inertia is the main issue, then we can't just wait for this to happen right? Someone has to jumpstart the process. I tried to give my first gen headset to a gamer friend and he didn't want it, for what I consider bullshit reasons. This litteraly put in my face that it's not even guaranted that giving away headsets for free could jumpstart VR. I think John Carmack said something similar that even giving away 20000$ vr light glasses prototypes might not even be enough to jumpstart vr in the way the hype expected it 8 years ago. Because VR already started and is not going away, it just seems that consumer usage rate will increase slower than what we hoped or expected. In 10-20 years the middle class won't have enough money to buy a VR headset. That’s much different than a niche entertainment device. You are talking about a whole technology, computers as we know it. Not fitness goggles Computers were used for much much more than beat saber All of what your describe are slow evolutions of things that started 50 or 100 years ago. For instance, between the gramophone and the CD player, there isn't that much evolution in how it's used. Same between an oven and a microwave oven. Between regular screen, and VR there is a huge paradigm shift, probably even bigger than between books and text on a screen. TL;DR: VR came the same long path as any other technology, and is based on very similar usage patterns, people just don't realize because they forget/don't know/ignore its long winded history. What's special about VR is the high level of immersion thanks to using a display type with head tracking, most of the rest is reusing tech/content from somewhere else. The first head mounted display was shown 1968 by Ivan Sutherland, and that one is literally why we call VR headsets HMD. So that's 56 years ago, and there were stereoscopic multimedia displays before, like the 1962 Sensorama (lacking head tracking) now considered early VR devices. And VR continuously crept forward, first only experimental, then for military, than as business and research tool since the 90's. Only consumer VR is still less than 15 years old, and it was 100% an evolutionary technology enabled by hires phone displays and GPUs running predistortion shaders that allowed using much cheaper lenses that previous HMDs. And the "paradigm shift" is head tracking, which allows for a 360° FoV incl. head turns, which massively increases immersion thanks to being in the world rather than looking at it through a small window. Stereoscopy only matters at close range. We already had 3D games you could run and look around in for more than a quarter of a century, where you turned the camera with the mouse instead of you head. RE4/8 on PSVR2 can be played both flat or in VR, there is no fundamental difference like between fixed text on paper vs changeable text on a screen that allows for many more and different use cases than a book. There is a new generation drawn to VR by viral Gorilla Tag videos on TikTok showing a fun way to spend time with friends, but even they will immediarely realize that this is basically just another type of video game played on a new type of display you strap to your head, which allows for the extra immersion only VR can provide. Everything else is mostly an evolution of previous tech, recycled once again. For example the 2006 Nintendo Wiimote was already an inside-out 5DoF controller, and by adding a second (controller/camera), you could do 6DoF tracking a decade before the Oculus Touch controllers appeared. I have good reasons why I compare the evolution of VR with other consumer electronics, and why I seriously doubt that Meta's pay-to-win strategy of endless subsidizing has a chance to still succeed, let alone would make sense for any other company. A decade after buying Oculus they are short USD ~100bn for less than 1% of Apple's/Google's active user base, with the Quest 3S selling less on Amazon during the last holiday season than the Quest 2 the year before. At this point Meta's best bet seem to be their Ray-Ban smart glasses, with many companies showing similar glasses with integrated displays at CES 2025. Simply because people actually like and buy these, because they consider them useful, without the need to massivey subsidize them. Just like with other technology before. Since we talk about commerical stuff, what matters is when the paradigm shift was made available to consumers more than when it was invented. In this regard, there is 90 years between the gramophone available to consumers and the cd. I can say I had the Razer Hydra, and had first taste of 1:1 tracking, and also toyed with wiimote as a trackir, or that famous paralax track ir video, that make you understand that paralax can have a pop out effect similar to stereoscopy, and also played with the cardboard. Despite all that and knowing the VR is reusing existing technologies, like you could say for all tech by the way, I consider the VR as a paradigm shift made available for consumers, only happened in 2016, with the Vive and Rift. So to me, 8 years is nothing at a human society level for something that changes so much how we interact with virtuality, wich we mostly did only by looking at flast screens until now. So I agree that technically it's just the viewport on the virtual world that is different, this is clear and simple to me as it is to you that it's not a huge technological leap. But psychologically this seems to be huge leap to many people. Either because it's too much virtual intensity, or change too much how they got used to enjoy videogames, or that it seems to nerdy. You could pour billions in that, you couldn't change this type of perception prejudices and inertia in less than 1 human generation probably. I am not beeing negative, and wish it was different, but I am starting to think this is the only rational explanation to how slow it feels it's developping, for something that maybe us tech geeks who always dreamed about that, do not feel it changes that much the paradigm. That's why I think the CD compared to tapes, or smartphone compared to dumb phone, is a bad comparison, because the paradigm shift timeline isn't comparable yet. I've been waiting for VR since the 90's, and when usable HMDs finally appeared a few years ago, I was sure it would take the world by storm, because this was obviously the medium of the future I had been dreaming about for decades. And then I was completely baffled when that didn't happen, and the world just didn't care. I must have demoed VR to hundreds of people, all of which were wowed, but almost none ever got a HMD themselves. Very few even asked later if they could try it again. Instead mobile games, the probably least immersive form of video games with the most simplified input played on a display covering ~6° of the horizontal FoV took over more than 50% of all gaming revenue within a few years, and much more of the total play time. So something didn't work out. I am actually very disappointed that those few who care about VR are mostly interested in games, while for me VR was always primarily a brain enhancement tool. But at some point I realized that the enourmous potential of VR I still have in my head is only loosely related to what is currently possible, or to what most people are looking for from any technology, which is mostly help with practical use cases, and convenience without requiring a lot of effort. I think VR is great because of what I expect it (one day) could do, while most people only look at what it currently actually does, which (unless you value immersion way more than most) isn't a lot besides a wow effect that quickly wears of with miserable ergonomics. So my own positive view includes a lot of projection not really based on the current state of the technology. Which is why I don't see a paradigm shift or even (un-)typical inertia when adapting something new: people have always embraced new technology once it became good enough to improve their lives, and all the technologies listed above were established that way, first by a few willing to go the extra mile, and only later by the masses, once all the rough edges were gone and the use both obvious and effortless. And VR simply isn't there yet, or anywhere close go it. It's still mostly a fancy toy for the more nerdy part of the population with seemingly endless potential, but currently only very limited practical use. The big mistake we inside the VR bubble make is insisting that the already available benefits are enough, when in reality they only matter for a rather small group of future oriented enthusiasts. For the vast majority VR simply doesn't offer enough yet to be worth the hassle. IMHO we are the anomaly, the rest of the world that can't be bothered with VR so far are the ones doing a more realistic cost/benefit evaluation based on their own priorities. We are still in the gramophone phase with a total of ten records availabe that tend to break after a few uses despite the required huge investment in money, effort and space. Still a huge improvement over the wax covered cylinders used in phonographs, but not yet as user friendly as vinyl records with electric amplifiers with speakers, idiot proof as CDs or as convenient as iPods. And for a lot of people VR will only become interesting once it becomes lile Spotify: its just there and works everywhere without ever having to worry what's going on in the background. Yes, the term "paradigm shift" can be applied to different phases depending how you look at it. You could say the paradigm shift is only the moment when behavior of the masses will shift to seemlessly use vr. I was thinking more of the paradigm shift that was available in 2016, were you started to be able to play the same game or some clone of the game, with or without vr. Like for me playing to Pavlov instead of Counter Strike was a no brainer, because it meant like beeing able to paintball or laser game at home. But for some reason what I see as a huge paradigm shift, isn't seen as this for other people, or they do not understand it, I don't know, while the same people would be down playing paintball or laser game instantly. It's like people are thinking but why would I listen to gramphone music at home with shitty sound, while I can listen and see musician playing at the concert all with amazing sound ? Why would I listen to music on a walkman in the street, while I can just think about music in my head when walking, or listen music confortably at home in a sofa ? We probably just forget that this technologies had the same inertia, and we can't say they were wrong thinking that in fact. But anyway, if VR enthousiast or new tech inventors were not sort of delusional, and knew VR would develop this slowly, we would probably had no vr yet, and that can be said about most tech probably. Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do. It took 50 years for consoles phones and PCs and other regular screen based devices to get were they are. VR could be just small light glasses with low price, it wouldn't change that it will take time for people to integrate this in their life. If you think about flat panels, many people didn't want one because Yes, it'll take time for VR to be as popular as phones and TVs, but it doesn't mean it can't exist in a meaningful way and bring value to millions of people today. However, someone needs to jumpstart the process, which is exactly what Meta did. You can still buy Quest Pro’s ‘Touch Pro’ controllers however, as they support Quest 2 and above. Thank god. Those were what convinced me as someone coming from PC VR headset with none insight out tracked controllers (Rift CV1 and Valve Index) to even consider a Quest 3. Meta, discontinuing those controllers in the future or even with your next headset would be a big mistake. Just release a Quest 3 premium or Quest 4 with oled screen ASAP… That’s all what matters Quest Pro isn't OLED The price of the Quest Pro is proof that meta cannot sell headsets at the actual cost, $1k should be the price of the Quest 3S while the Quest Pro should be $2k or so. Meta can only sell garbage because customers are not willing to pay the actual costs due to the garbage performance and garbage graphics the headset delivers. This is why Meta loses BILLIONS per month. they just reported record profit, where do you get your information from? If you go to upload VR and see meta-reality-labs-q3-2024-revenue-rebound-continues You will find that Meta's VR division has lost about $50 billion since its 2020 creation. You do understand the difference between revenue and profit/income? You realize that all Meta's VR efforts are just to get to AR right? Ray Bans with full phone capability is the end goal, take Samsung, Apple, Google market share in hardware via AR. Yes, 100% that Meta wants to enslave its users both capturing everything you see and here and simultaneiously blocking what you see and here depending on their censorship algorithms in the real world. They will also debank you as the ultimate weapon against thought crime. I am also glad you agree that meta VR has lost $50 billion since its inception of 2020 and is continuing to lose BILLIONS per month in order to sell people garbage hardware. VR Industry would be pretty much nothing without that Meta cash infusion. Yes of course they want to make money eventually, that is their reason for existence. I too am not in favor of our tech overlords, and yet I still want it. I suppose that you eschew the use of all non ethical VR systems? The VR industry is composed mostly of garbageware games that have retarded what VR was since 2020. Meta has done nothing but drag the entire industry down. If you look at any full time VR Youtuber, they will admit like Mateo that graphics have become retarded in VR. They just accept the retardation of the industry otherwise they couldn't stay in VR and be saine. VR Content creators for the most part are chearleading garbageware to keep the views and their sanity. I would like an ethical approach to Reviewing VR content. Garbage Mobile VR should be labeled separately even if this garbage is ported to steam/psvr2. Unless the ports are outstandig like Star Wars Tailes from the Galaxy's Edge Enhaced Edition on PSVR2, all mobile garbage ware should get a tag. When people review discuss mobile ports, they should indidcate that their judgement and scale is based on mobile garbage hardware and is not a comparison against Modern Hardware (Console/PC). That would help with transparency. It would also educate people who simply believe Meta Mobile Garbage is what all VR is like. IT IS NOT. We need to break meta mobile garbage hardware's hold on the market. The only way is education because Meta is already losing billions per month trying to capture the public. You seem pretty negative, what are some things you think aren’t garbage? There are some very great experiences available for console/pc vr. "Gran Turismo 7" (Paid) & "My First Gran Turismo" (Free) are the pinnacle of VR on PS5. Of course "Horizon Call of the Mountain" is awesome. The demo is a great entryway to show people what VR is like (the boat ride scene allows people to adjust). "Until You Fall" is probably the best VR Melee combat game on the market (avaiable on all platforms). The graphics on PC/PSVR2 are good. I don't believe it is a work out game, it is simply a result of good physics. "Star Wars Tails from the Galaxy's Edge" is a really great experience that provides many different VR interactions coupled with adequate progression. I also enjoyed embodying several different unique characters from the SW universe. I also enjoyed "Arizona Sunshine 2", that was when the studio was still PC focused. Veritgo Games is now focused on Mobile Garbage hardware and it shows with how terrible metro is when compared to their fairly old Arizona Sunshine 2. For awesome graphics and a great puzzle game, Red Matter 2 is it. I don’t do consoles although I did like Gran Turismo 2 on an emulator in prep for driving my FD3S on Laguna Seca. Of course just using the headset as a display etc results in better quality graphics, Meta nor anybody else has 4090 quality on a headset. I guess you are just not a fan of any standalone VR. The best melee in Battle Talent in MR mode, it’s really good. Still haven’t found a better fighting sim than Thrill of the Fight despite the terrible graphics. Without Dynamic Foveated Rendering (DFR), the nvidia rtx 4090 is simply not good enough. The next rtx5090 won't be good enough either. Eye tracking is that important to graphics and Meta has proven they really don't care about eye tracking because their goal isn't making great gaming VR headsets. It is as you pointed out, making garbage hardware they can push onto the masses. It is really a big loss for PSVR2 on PC to not have implemented Eye Tracking. I can understand that Sony maybe didn't want to pay Tobii licensing fees on the PC for the eye tracking software – that is my suspecision of why eye tracking is not on PC for PSVR2. DFR is what allows GT7 to look so good on the PSVR2. Without eye tracking, the graphics would be much worse. Even on garbage hardware like Quest 3, eye tracking COULD allow for higher graphics rendering. But meta doesn't care about that. They care about TEXT and hand tracking. They don't care about VR gaming. I’ve never had the opportunity to try eye tracking. Hand tracking still isn’t great, it feels awkward to me. I’d rather have full body tracking. I mean, Meta put eye tracking on Quest Pro, seems maybe it cost too much to do it on the Quest 3. No. He is a known elitist troll and the opposite of Virgin. He will shit on any standalone VR because he couldn't accept that PCVR will never be main stream by itself. Aw look who's been watching Black Mirror. I really enjoyed watching Black Mirror – it is almost as if they are telling us their play book ahead of time. Michael (incel) Speth: Garbage graphics etc. Yup. Just blocked him. Not worth reading any of his content. Quest pro should never have been released, the fact that it did shows a poor working culture inside meta Still kicking myself a bought this turkey.

Title: Washington Post Expected To Layoff ‘Dozens’ Of Employees In Coming Week: Report

AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke Staffers at The Washington Post are braced for a wave of layoffs that could reshape the paper’s future, with cuts expected to be announced this week, according to a new report from Oliver Darcy. Darcy’s Status newsletter reported Sunday that one source said that the layoffs will focus on the newspaper’s “business division” and impact “dozens of employees.” “One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees,” Darcy wrote. These anticipated layoffs follow an exodus of prominent talent after the newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently lost a number of big names, including managing editor Matea Gold, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz – several of which were poached by The Atlantic. The news comes just after Darcy broke the news that reporter Josh Dawsey was set to leave The Post to join the Wall Street Journal. According to Status, The Post’s struggles are partly attributed to finances that have seen better days. Those familiar with internal discussions say that top management has not kept these challenges under wraps. “Those financial problems were exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” Darcy noted. A spokesperson for The Post declined to offer immediate comment to Status on the revelation. Have a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here.

The CE 100 Index ended the last few days of 2024 and the first few days of the new year with a slight gain, adding 0.3%, while broader markets fell across the board. The Live Pillar pulled ahead by 2.3%, buoyed by iRobot, a volatile name that was up more than 24% through the week, though without any company-specific news, by Porch Group, which gained 7.5% and by Zillow, up 2.1%. The Eat segment was 2.2% higher; restaurant tech Olo advanced by 6.3% and DoorDash was 3.3% higher. Olo shares moved on the news, as reported by Yahoo Finance, that RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg increased the sell-side firm’s price target on Olo to $9 from $8, while maintaining an “outperform” rating on the name. But the Work segment countered those gains, sliding 2.2%. Xerox gave up 9.6%, giving back some of the gains that had been seen after the company struck a deal to buy Lexmark for $1.5 billion. Workday’s stock was off by 5%. In a December announcement, Workday and Guardian Life Insurance Company of America announced an expanded partnership, with the insurance firm becoming one of its strategic Workday Wellness partners. According to the announcement, Workday Wellness, an AI-powered solution, will give Guardian customers real-time insights into how their employees are using their benefits, leading to tailored benefits programs within Workday and improved overall employee experience. Guardian will introduce new application programming interface (API) connections with Workday as part of the expanded pact. Apple’s stock slipped 4.8%. As reported this past week, the tech juggernaut has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a privacy lawsuit centered on its voice assistant, Siri. The plaintiffs had argued that when Siri was activated unintentionally, the voice-activated assistant shared private discussions it overheard, and Apple allegedly shared those discussions with third parties — whereupon ads were sent to plaintiffs after mentioning various products. A preliminary settlement was filed on Dec. 31 but must be approved by a U.S. district judge. The proposed settlement requires Apple to address alleged privacy violations outlined in the lawsuit by confirming it has permanently deleted Siri audio recordings obtained before October 2019. FedEx’s shares gave up 2.2%, helping lead the Move pillar down by 0.2%. The shares lost ground as the company noted toward the end of December that its latest quarterly results saw revenues slip by 1% to $22 billion and it is streamlining operations by focusing on its DRIVE program and separating FedEx Freight into a standalone, publicly traded company. This move aims to unlock value for shareholders while allowing the two businesses to remain strategically aligned, management said during the call with analysts to discuss results. Management also noted during the call the challenges faced by FedEx during the quarter included a soft global industrial economy and competitive pricing pressures. Also within the Move segment, Tesla’s stock was 4.9% lower. Data from Tesla’s latest delivery report noted that the company had delivered a bit more than 495,900 vehicles on a global basis, up from 484,500 last year but below consensus analyst estimates on Wall Street of around 510,000 vehicles. For the year, the 1.78 million vehicles delivered marked a slight decline from 2023 levels — the first annual decline for Tesla. The company has stated in the past that growth rates might be lower than had been seen in 2023, as the firm set its sights on its next generation vehicles, as detailed by sites such as Yahoo Finance. Microsoft said that it plans to invest $80 billion to build data centers in fiscal 2025, aiming to use them to power the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI). The company is doing so amid a “golden opportunity for American AI,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that debuted on Friday. More than half of this investment in AI infrastructure will be deployed in the United States, according to the post. Microsoft plans to train 2.5 million Americans with AI skills. “AI, like all new technologies, will disrupt the economy and displace some jobs,” Smith wrote. “But as we’ve working on skilling initiatives during the past few years, our confidence has grown that AI will create new opportunities that will outweigh many of the challenges ahead.” The company’s stock was down 1.7% through the week, though the overall Enablers vertical, as tracked by PYMNTS, was 0.7% higher. In other AI related-news, Meta is looking toward a future where AI characters generate content on its social media platforms Instagram and Facebook. These AI characters will exist alongside existing accounts on the platforms, Connor Hayes, vice president of product for generative AI at Meta, told the Financial Times. Meta shares gained 0.8%, which helped the overall performance of the Enablers. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform … that’s where we see all of this going,” Hayes said. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Taylor Wimpey's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 21 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of Taylor Wimpey plc (LON:TW.), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Taylor Wimpey. View our latest analysis for Taylor Wimpey Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Taylor Wimpey. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Taylor Wimpey's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Taylor Wimpey is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.9% of common stock, and UBS Asset Management AG holds about 3.5% of the company stock. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Taylor Wimpey plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£3.5m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Taylor Wimpey (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .

Title: Watch These Supermico Price Levels as Stock Pops After Volatile Year

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares are likely to remain in the spotlight to start the week after jumping more than 10% Friday to snap a five-session losing streak and log their best one-day performance since early December. Supermicro is looking to move past a volatile 2024 in which accounting and corporate governance issues led to several delayed financial reports. However, CEO Charles Liang said last month that postponed filings will be completed by a Feb. 25 deadline issued by the Nasdaq, easing concerns about a potential delisting. Sentiment may have also received a boost after Microsoft (MSFT) announced Friday that it plans to spend about $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI), a move that could benefit the server maker through increased partnerships and hardware sales. Supermicro shares ended last year with a 7% gain, but surged more than four-fold between January and March before slumping as much as 85% from their record high. Below, we break down the technicals on Supermicro’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Since mid-July, Supermicro shares have oscillated within an orderly descending broadening formation, with the stock tagging both the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time. More recently, the price has traded in a narrow range since mid-December but closed above the 50-day moving average (MA) on Friday on the highest trading volume in over a week. Let’s take a closer look at key support and resistance levels on Supermicro’s chart that investors may be eyeing. The bulls' inability to hold the 50-day MA could initially lead to a retest of the $26 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near the high of a brief countertrend rally in early November. A decisive breakdown below this level may see Supermicro shares drop to around $18, an area about 46% below Friday's closing price where they would likely encounter significant support near the prominent November swing low. Follow-through buying this week could propel a move up to the $39 level, an area currently just below the broadening formation’s upper trendline. The shares may run into selling pressure in this region near two key troughs that formed on the chart in September. Further upside could see the shares climb to around $50, where they may encounter resistance near a trendline that connects a range of comparable price points on the chart from the early-August trough to December peak. Finally, a more bullish move could drive a move to the $63 level. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower prices may look for profit-taking opportunities around the August swing high, which currently sits in close proximity to the downward sloping 200-day MA.
