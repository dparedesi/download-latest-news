Title: Is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) the Best Dividend Growth Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend growth stocks. Dividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn't unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term. Also read: 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In Historically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market’s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock's appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience. This resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "Ideally, I look for a stock that has a combination of these factors. I can't always get all 3, so I look for a good balance of them. If I can get higher quality at a cheaper price, and the company pays a compelling dividend, that's when a stock is really interesting to me." High-quality companies also provide the benefit of consistent dividend growth. Investors view dividends as a long-term commitment, so companies that pay them must maintain profitability, generate returns, and ensure steady cash flow. This makes dividends an important measure of a company’s overall quality. Firms that regularly raise their dividend payments show that they are consistently generating profits, which may indicate greater resilience during economic or market downturns. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy. 5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.51% NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) ranks fifth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The Florida-based renewable energy company posted strong earnings recently. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.57 billion, a 5.6% increase from the previous year. The company had another strong quarter in renewable energy and storage development, adding about 3 gigawatts (GW) to its project backlog for the second consecutive quarter. Over the past four quarters, it has secured roughly 11 GW in new projects. Madison Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Oracle Corporation, Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. NextEra has continued to perform well given its strong position in the renewable energy space, increasing demand for power, its transmission capabilities, as well as a tailwind from lower interest rates.” In addition to its strong foundation, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has developed one of the largest portfolios of solar and wind power assets worldwide. This segment has gained from the shift away from polluting carbon fuels towards cleaner, renewable energy sources. Given the long-term nature of the power transition, the company is poised for continued growth over the coming decades. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered a nearly 19% return to shareholders. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share on October 18, which fell in line with its previous dividend. In 2024, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 28 years. Moreover, the company has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 10.5% in the past five years. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.86%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 69 funds held stakes in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $2.47 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall NEE ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NEE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: While institutions own 40% of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 58% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deutsche Bank's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Institutional ownership in Deutsche Bank is 40% If you want to know who really controls Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Bank Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Deutsche Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Deutsche Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.2% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €336m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Deutsche Bank shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deutsche Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Deutsche Bank you should be aware of.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is A Buy, And I Think It Will Continue To Perform Well’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-amazon-com-055243750.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-14-24 Performance Since Then: 31.56% Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the biggest eCommerce firm in the US and also a key player in the lucrative cloud computing industry. Its partnership with AI firm Anthropic has also allowed the company to establish a foothold for itself in the AI industry and access technologies for enterprise AI products provided through AWS. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the handful of firms that operate across all layers of the AI stack - from designing custom chips to providing end-use applications. The tail-end of November and the start of December have been great for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares as its Project Rainier supercomputer built using in-house Trainium chips will be used by Anthropic to train AI. Cramer was very optimistic about the firm in August: "We recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Investing in the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is generally a smart move as the index has historically returned an annual average of 9% per year with dividends reinvested, but other funds may beat the S&P 500. One of the best-performing ETFs of the last 10 years has been the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), up roughly 800% over that time span. Investors of all types can benefit from the power of dividend stocks. Although dividends are usually sought by those in or nearing retirement, those regular payouts can contribute mightily to your long-term returns wherever you are in your investing journey. In those times, recurring dividend payments can cushion a portfolio's returns and give an investor cash to reinvest while stocks are trading at lower levels. With the broader stock market indexes hovering around all-time highs, some investors may fear that a sell-off is creeping on the horizon in 2025. After all, equity prices have outpaced earnings growth, leading to a relatively expensive market.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is A Buy, And I Think It Will Continue To Perform Well’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode.

The firm has managed to position itself as one of the most important AI stocks in the industry after suffering devastating market performance in 2022 because of Mark Zuckerberg's focus on the metaverse.

Title: Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Has Been Telling You Can Get 4x Your Money If You Buy His Chips’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 25.75% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer whose shares have gained more than 700% since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 107 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: -8.43% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is the only company in the world with a sizable presence in the x86 CPU and GPU markets. In both of these markets, the firm is the second biggest player. Its presence in the CPU industry has helped Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) eke out market share following chip giant Intel's historic struggles with manufacturing the latest chips. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s acquisitions over the past couple of years have provided it with a footing in tertiary industries such as FPGAs and AI products. While its AI accelerators are also somewhat popular, sentiment has soured in the year's second half. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares are down by 9.6% year-to-date; but, Cramer was optimistic in August: "AMD isn't nipping at their heels. AMD is dominating. It's actually taking gobs of market share, and galy 3 is not a factor when it comes to Nvidia's high-end chips." Overall AMD ranks 8th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 99 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 93.81% Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the world's biggest pure-play electric vehicle company which is also a key player in the AI industry due to the tech-focused nature of its CEO Elon Musk. The firm's assisted driving platform FSD is among the market leaders in its niche, and it uses AI and copious computing resources to derive real-time driving insights. Musk's proximity with President-elect Donald Trump has also injected fresh life into Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares since the November election. Ahead of the election, the shares were up by a meager 1.22% year-to-date due to broader weakness in the EV industry and a lack of clear guidance on autonomous ridesharing and other initiatives. Since then, Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s stock has gained 71.7%. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Investors should own shares of Tesla [heading] into the electric vehicle maker’s robotaxi event set for Oct. 10, according to analysts at Piper Sandler. The unveiling event was originally slated for Aug. 8, but CEO Elon Musk has said he requested design changes that resulted in the delay. Piper Sandler maintained its buy-equivalent rating and $300 price target on the stock. Shares of Tesla are down about 13% year to date." Overall TSLA ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move

Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is pessimistic that the prospect of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would get an approval from the incoming administration. Young Ju is not convinced that the proposed Bitcoin reserve would push through, saying it is unlikely that Trump would embrace the crypto strategy to protect US dollar dominance because the greenback remains a safe haven currency. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 The executive of CryptoQuant thinks that the policies of the new government would be much influenced by the apparent strength of the US economy and the predominance of the American currency in international trade. Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: Why Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) Is the Top Luxury Stock According to Hedge Funds

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 12 Luxury Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) stands against other luxury stocks according to hedge funds. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the luxury goods market has a size of $103.10 billion as of 2024. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.07% and reach $145.08 billion by 2029. Similarly, a study by Global Market Insights published on Yahoo! Finance shows that the luxury packaging market was valued at $17.2 billion in 2023. It is also anticipated to grow and reach $25.8 billion by the end of 2032. North America’s demand for luxury products is significantly high, primarily due to the region’s high disposable incomes. This is especially significant in the ongoing holiday shopping season in the US. On December 17, Simeon Siegel, BMO Capital Markets senior analyst for retail and e-commerce, appeared on CNBC to discuss the state of the consumer in the current holiday shopping season. He said that the US consumer is overly resilient. In the current scenario, the market is seeing winners grow and laggers fall behind, which is how it should be. This trend goes opposite to market dynamics in COVID-19 when every company grew. Siegel was further of the view that the consumers are still spending. For better and for worse, consumers are scared of not having something under the Christmas tree this year. On December 10, CNBC’s Steve Liesman appeared on ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the CNBC NRF Retail Monitor. Numbers from the Monitor corroborated Siegel’s claim and showed healthy consumer spending in November despite a shorter holiday shopping season in 2024. Non-store retailers showed a 21.5% year-over-year growth, reflecting these positive trends. Since this holiday shopping season came with lower gas prices and a deflation in the prices of goods overall, consumers had more discretionary dollars in their pockets and paid somewhat less compared to a year ago. Since luxury items fall in the category of discretionary items, these trends show positive stimulus for the industry. We discussed consumer behavior in the ongoing holiday shopping season in a recently published article on the 7 best department store stocks to buy now. Here is an excerpt from the article: “The holiday shopping season is in full swing in the United States. On December 2, Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, appeared on CNBC to discuss Black Friday spending and its effects on consumer sentiment. She said that while 2024 was a challenging year for retailers, the numbers rolling in from the holiday season seem promising. High hopes were especially placed on Black Friday sales, and while the numbers aren’t all in, they look pretty good. This trend holds particularly true online, where sales seem to be up by 15% or so compared to last year in many markets. According to CNBC, the total Black Friday e-commerce spending was around $10.8 billion. However, Moulton said that footfall in stores wasn’t so good, and continued to be flat year-over-year. On December 2, Mastercard Economics Institute chief economist Michelle Meyer appeared on CNBC to discuss industry trends and said that consumers have been geared to find value and best deals. She said that the Black Friday numbers show that consumers have been monitoring the market and gearing up to spend on the Black Friday weekend. With inflation cooling and promotions returning, consumers are focused on finding the best deals in the market that offer value at a discount. This was one of the major motivating factors that drove considerably strong spending in e-commerce during the Black Friday weekend. Apparel, jewelry, and electronics remain the top gift sectors for the holidays, but consumers are prioritizing promotions with the greatest value instead of going ahead with brand loyalty. Meyer was of the view that consumers have the ability and the willingness to spend; they are just being savvy with their expenses by spending when promotions and deals come in. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 luxury stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) operates Harley-Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) and Harley-Davidson Financial Services. HDMC manufactures and designs luxury Harley-Davidson motorcycles, motorcycle parts, apparel, and accessories. It operates globally, with operations in the EMEA region, Asia, the United States, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. The company experienced a challenging global market environment in fiscal Q3 2024 due to macroeconomic and political uncertainty and the pressure of high interest rates affecting its industry and customers. As a result, its global retail sales of new motorcycles dropped by 13% in fiscal Q3 2024. North America saw a 10% decline, compared to 18% across international regions. Overall, Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) is seeing greater spending from higher-income customers. Its motorcycle mix corroborates this, with CVO motorcycles up double-digital percentages throughout 2024. The company’s touring segment in the United States was up by around 10% through the end of fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was driven by its new touring lineup. It gained more than four percentage points of market share, outperforming the category, its other segments, and the market as a whole. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) ranks 12th on our list of the top 12 luxury stocks according to hedge funds. Artisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “The biggest detractors from performance during the quarter were Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG), Henry Schein and Expedia. Harley’s share price declined 23% during the quarter after a strong run in Q1. We had significantly reduced our position at higher share prices over the past 12–18 months. The shares have been weak over concerns that higher interest rates are impacting affordability and retail sales. We share these concerns. Harley is likely to reduce its forecasts for the year when it reports, though this now appears to be discounted in the valuation. Famous last words. The shares now trade at a single-digit multiple of earnings. We believe the brand is strong, and management is able to adjust production and costs to meet various demand environments. If interest rates begin to decline as anticipated, demand should improve.” Overall, HOG ranks 12th on our list of luxury stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of luxury stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) designs, markets, and distributes luxury athletic footwear, accessories, equipment, and services for sports and fitness activities. Its operating segments span EMEA, Greater China, APLA, and North America. The company also designs products specifically for the Converse and Jordan brands. Several of its products are valued at thousands of dollars. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is considered one of the top luxury fashion brands, and has a market cap of $113.75 billion. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported a decline of 8% in its revenues on a reported basis and a 9% decline on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal Q2 2025. This decline was primarily due to the ongoing headwinds from the company’s franchise management actions. It is shifting its product portfolio by reducing the proportion of its business driven by its classic footwear franchises, including Air Jordan 1, Air Force 1, and Dunk. This caused a reduction in revenues from these franchises as the company continued to tighten its marketplace supply. These franchises decelerated faster than the company’s business in fiscal Q2 2025, at a rate greater than fiscal Q1 2025. The company is actively rebalancing product allocations to its highest traffic channel to maximize full-price realization and franchise health. The company is driving the biggest reductions to its classic footwear franchises on NIKE Direct, which fell 14% with NIKE Digital declining 21% and NIKE Stores declining 2%. However, the company also saw momentum build with positive physical and digital traffic. Black Friday week proved to be the largest demand week ever on NIKE Digital with sales increasing by double-digits. Similarly, 11/11 sales exceeded company plans in Greater China. Fiscal Q2 2025 thus reflected progress in key areas, with the company gaining consumer support. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Other moves during the quarter included sales of United Parcel Service (UPS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Nike has become overly reliant on key platforms, like Jordan, for revenue growth while innovation in areas like running has lagged. Nike could face continued revenue and profit pressure as it invests to re-invigorate innovation and re-position the business back toward wholesale outlets. As such, we are seeking out better ways to participate in the global consumer recovery in companies where earnings estimates have already reset.” Overall, NKE ranks first on our list of luxury stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of luxury stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NKE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is First Solar (FSLR) Among the Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-solar-fslr-among-best-204440037.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) stands against the other best renewable energy stocks to buy now. The future of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a significant role in promoting renewable energy by offering a wide range of tax incentives and funding mechanisms to encourage investment in clean energy technologies, including solar, wind, and geothermal power, hangs in the balance as the incoming Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House of Representatives prepare to take office in 2025. However, an area of concern is the future of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which provides financing for green energy projects. The LPO has been instrumental in funding large-scale renewable energy projects and it expanded significantly under the IRA. However, Trump’s appointees, particularly Wright, who has expressed skepticism about the climate crisis, may be inclined to scale back or dismantle this program entirely, which could have a significant impact on the green energy sector. READ ALSO: 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 23, Tom Steyer, Co-Founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a climate-focused global investment firm, discussed the role of renewable energy in the United States. Steyer emphasized that while the year 2025 is often discussed in the context of climate regulations, it is more accurately about meeting the growing energy demand. He argued that renewable energy should be at the center of any energy bill, regardless of political persuasion. Steyer highlighted that market costs are the primary drivers of the energy transition to renewables. He cited the fact that in 2023, 86% of new electricity generation was predominantly from renewable sources, driven by economic rather than purely environmental considerations. Steyer pointed out that the phrase “drill, baby, drill” might still be part of the political conversation, but the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuels drives the reality. He noted that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and are becoming increasingly cost-effective. For instance, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. has risen to nearly double its previous levels, while in Europe, it is even higher. However, the cheapest electricity is increasingly coming from renewable sources, both in the U.S. and globally. This economic reality is driving business decisions, international competitiveness, and national security by industries such as tech, that require large amounts of electricity and are increasingly turning to renewables to meet their energy needs. When asked about the potential impact of deregulation in the energy sector, Steyer suggested that deregulation could help accelerate the adoption of renewables if it includes faster permitting and lower oversight for all energy projects, including renewables. He noted that the Trump administration’s push for faster permits and reduced oversight for oil and gas drilling could extended to renewables, and will lead to a significant expansion of low-cost, abundant renewable energy. Regarding nuclear energy, Steyer acknowledged its potential but noted the challenges associated with cost, safety, and public perception. He pointed out that nuclear energy has historically been expensive, with the last nuclear plant in Georgia costing at least four times its original estimate. While nuclear energy could provide a stable baseload power source, the high costs and safety concerns have made it a less attractive option compared to renewables. As the United States enters 2025, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remains uncertain under a Republican government.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology’s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground. To compile our list of the 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies with a share price of under $10 as of December 24, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) Among the Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) stands against the other undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. A dividend aristocrat is an S&P 500 company that not only maintains regular dividend payments to shareholders but also increases its payouts annually. To qualify as a dividend aristocrat, a company must raise its dividends consistently for at least 25 consecutive years. Michael Clarfeld, Portfolio Manager at ClearBridge, recently talked about why companies that consistently grow their dividends are well-positioned to handle the challenges of 2025. With rising costs, tighter margins, higher interest rates, and inflation on the horizon, Clarfeld is still optimistic about the economy. He pointed to strong employment numbers, upbeat consumer sentiment, and confident businesses, especially after the election. Pro-business policies under the Trump administration could drive investments and growth, which sounds great, but there’s a catch. For instance, bringing manufacturing back to the US would create jobs and boost wages, but it could also increase business costs. After two strong years, Clarfeld doesn’t see much room for big capital gains in 2025. Plus, with inflation sticking around, the Federal Reserve is likely to take a more cautious approach. That said, he sees opportunities in sectors like European and global consumer staples and US energy infrastructure. Clarfeld is a big fan of dividend growth stocks, calling them a timeless investment. They can act as a safety net during volatile markets and provide steady income, which is especially useful when capital appreciation feels out of reach. He also highlighted how dividends help protect your purchasing power by keeping up with inflation. In his view, dividend growth is a smart and reliable strategy for navigating a potentially bumpy 2025. Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors sees dividend investing as a smart move, expecting the Fed to ease rates. According to Baiocchi, investors are shifting from money markets and fixed income to dividend-paying stocks, especially companies with leverage that could benefit from lower interest rates. Similarly, Mike Akins of ETF Action also sees dividend ETFs as a defensive play, highlighting that the companies included typically have strong balance sheets. He notes the growing popularity of dividend-focused ETFs, suggesting that consistent dividends give investors confidence in a company’s stability and financial health. Both experts agree that dividends offer a sense of durability and drawdown protection in uncertain markets. A wheat field at sunset, showing the company's commitment to agricultural commodities. In this article, we selected stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats List that had a P/E ratio below 20 as of December 23. Our focus was on identifying stocks with the strongest hedge fund sentiment in Q3 2024 among the 66 Dividend Aristocrats that also met our P/E criteria. The stocks are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders for each company. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Dividend Yield as of December 23: 3.79% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 P/E Ratio: 14.18 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is a global leader in the procurement, transportation, storage, and processing of agricultural commodities, with operations in several countries, including the US, Switzerland, Brazil, and the UK. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) handles agricultural raw materials like oilseeds, offers a wide range of food and animal feed products, and produces ingredients for different industries, such as food, energy, and chemicals. It also provides specialized products like proteins, natural flavors, and pet food. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) reported a challenging third quarter in 2024, with net earnings of $18 million and adjusted net earnings of $530 million. Earnings per share were $0.04, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.09, both down from the previous year. A non-cash charge of $461 million related to its Wilmar equity investment impacted GAAP earnings. The company also experienced an 8% drop in revenue, totaling $20 billion for the quarter, missing analyst estimates by $1.57 billion. Despite these setbacks, ADM's cash flow remained strong, with operating cash flow reaching $2.5 billion year-to-date, up from $1.9 billion the previous year. ADM also remains committed to its long-standing tradition of dividend growth, with 51 consecutive years of increases and a current quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. As per Insider Monkey’s third-quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 35 funds in the last quarter. Overall, ADM ranks 5th on our list of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ADM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI data centers are making your electricity supply worse and could damage your home, new study says

Time Published: 2024-12-29T19:59:31Z

Data centers in the United States are consuming so much power that they may be impacting the flow of electricity to millions of Americans. AI data centers are sprouting up across the country to meet the increased demand for AI, but they're also sucking up the power on which millions of Americans rely. The new tech is demanding massive amounts of energy from grids that are, in some areas, already stressed. Researchers have estimated that AI centers could need three to five times the power used by traditional facilities, Business Insider previously reported. A Bloomberg analysis assessed readings from some 770,000 homes from February to October and found that over 75% of "highly distorted power readings across the country are within 50 miles of significant data center activity." Stresses on the power grid can lead to inconsistent power quality, and as the power quality decreases, the risk increases, Bloomberg reported. Inconsistent energy flow can cause electronics to overheat, leading to sparks or even house fires. A small handful of large tech companies own the vast majority of global data centers — and they show no signs of slowing down as they pour billions into building more powerful AI models. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft own about 65% of the cloud infrastructure market, which includes data centers, according to a 2023 report from market research firm Synergy Research Group. Google announced in April that it's investing $3 billion to build and expand data centers in Virginia and Indiana. The search engine giant unveiled its latest AI model, Gemini 2.0, in December. Amazon, which is a large investor in AI startup Anthropic, is investing another $10 billion in Ohio data centers, Gov. Mike DeWine announced on December 16. Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, said in September that the company has partnered with other investors, including BlackRock, in a $100 billion energy infrastructure project. The project will include "new and expanded data centers," the company said. To meet AI's increasing energy demands, companies like Google have also started turning to nuclear power to find more reliable and sustainable energy sources. Jump to

Title: Jim Cramer on Intel Corporation (INTC): ‘Better Than Ever. Don’t Worry About It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician soldering components for a semiconductor board. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 68 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: -0.83% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world's largest integrated chip manufacturer. While its business model of designing and manufacturing chips provides it with a clear advantage in the industry, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has struggled in 2024. The firm's AI chips have failed to compete with NVIDIA's offerings, and sluggishness in the personal computing market has hit its revenues right when it's investing in retaking the chip manufacturing process technology lead from Taiwan's TSMC. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s shares are down 57.5% year-to-date, and it's exiting 2024 with more turmoil in the form of former CEO Patrick Gelsinger's surprising exit. Cramer started out his comments about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with sarcasm and then pointed out its troubles: "Intel's fine. Better than ever. Don't worry about it. I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. DREAM ON! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut his dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner." Overall INTC ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 26 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 35.10% Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) is an electrical infrastructure company whose products are used in data centers that compute AI workloads. It's one of the top-performing stocks of 2024 due to strong revenue growth stemming from tailwinds in the data center and utilities markets. Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s revenue grew by 45% during its fiscal year 2024, and the shares are up by 156% year-to-date. One key factor that has driven investor optimism in the firm's stock is its backlog. A robust backlog lets investors gain visibility into future orders. As of its fiscal Q4, Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s backlog remained steady at $1.4 billion. Cramer commented on the backlog and other factors surrounding the firm: "Lately, the market has fallen in love with a particular kind of industrial stock. These are still smokestack stocks, but they also have powerful secular growth drivers, meaning they can thrive even if the economy doesn't accelerate. Tonight, I have a smaller company that falls into the same category: Powell Industries. This company has been around since 1947 and went public decades ago. However, the stock has caught my attention over the past couple of years, skyrocketing from $20 in late September 2022 to $171 today—a gain of more than 700%. So, what does this company do, and how did the stock manage to catch fire like this? More importantly, can it keep running once the Fed starts blessing us with rate hikes?

Title: 2024: The Extraordinary Year When Bitcoin Went Mainstream

A view of the New Year's Eve '2024' Numerals, to be lit up at midnight on December 31, in New York's ... [+] world-famous Times Square in United States on December 20, 2023. (Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu via Getty Images) History will remember 2024 as the year bitcoin transformed from a niche investment to a mainstream asset. With its dollar exchange rate breaking the symbolic $100,000 mark, and the largest financial firms in the world embracing a bitcoin strategy, the orange coin can no longer be dismissed. You can still think whatever you want about bitcoin, you just can’t ignore it. The new year promises many exciting possibilities such as adoption at the highest levels of government, expansion of bitcoin’s use as an institutional treasury asset, an overhaul of regulation to make the U.S. more friendly to financial innovation, and geopolitical dynamics that propel bitcoin into a new era. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs – a moment that will likely be viewed as a watershed in financial history. For years, the SEC resisted bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation and investor protections. The approval marked a decisive shift in the agency’s stance, sending billions of dollars in liquidity into the market and boosting confidence in bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their launch was the most successful in the history of ETFs and now hold more assets under management than gold ETFs. BlackRock iShares ETF AUM: Gold vs. Bitcoin. (CryptoQuant) These ETFs have provided an open door for new sources of liquidity to enter into the bitcoin markets, since certain pools of capital cannot be converted to physical bitcoin, but can purchase regulated financial products like ETFs. Perhaps even more crucially, bitcoin ETFs have normalized bitcoin as an investment. Pension funds, retirement accounts, and institutional portfolios – and the financial advisors that manage them – now have a way to achieve bitcoin exposure with the same ease as stocks, bonds, and other instruments. Institutional adoption of bitcoin reached unprecedented levels in 2024. BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank, gained SEC approval to offer bitcoin custody services, a move signaling that even the most conservative institutions now recognize bitcoin’s staying power. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, received approval for the iShares Bitcoin Trust to offer spot bitcoin ETF options. This paved the way for more efficient price discovery, which may dampen price volatility in 2025. Although volatility is not inherently bad, it does prevent certain types of investors from entering the market. A meaningful reduction in volatility may lead in turn to higher confidence in the asset, leading to yet more inflows, and thus more price discovery, further dampened volatility, and so on, establishing a virtuous cycle of adoption and appreciation of bitcoin as an asset class. Bitcoin’s mainstream moment was also catalyzed by visionary corporate leaders. MicroStrategy, already renowned as a bitcoin pioneer, announced an audacious plan to raise $42 billion over three years to expand its bitcoin holdings. Since that announcement, the company has already filed additional paperwork with the SEC to issue yet more shares, to buy yet more bitcoin. Microstrategy’s treasury operations are a fascinating financial innovation that will be studied for years to come. Inspired by MicroStrategy’s leadership, a handful of other companies followed suit in 2024, including Semler Scientific, Metaplanet, and others. In fact, in just the past few days, new filings with the SEC reveal several new bitcoin ETFs on the horizon: There’s no other way to say it – in one of the most contentious presidential elections in U.S. history, Americans elected a pro-bitcoin president in a landslide. On his path to retake the White House, Donald Trump spoke openly of his support for bitcoin, and even delivered a historic keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. Key Trump administration members have vocalized support for bitcoin, including RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Don Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and others. At the same time, congress is getting into the game, with U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis championing a proposal to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). An SBR would position the United States as a global leader in sound money, leveraging bitcoin as both a hedge and an asset of geopolitical significance – and could even help restore separation of powers within the federal government. With the incoming administration facing significant economic challenges, it is a good thing that bitcoin is rightly viewed as a tool for meeting them. As we approach the end of 2024, bitcoin’s market capitalization has surpassed silver and even Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s most valuable companies. With the momentary passing of the $100,000 price milestone, questions naturally arise about what the price will be a year from now. The events of 2024 suggest that the momentum is far from over. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, regulators are becoming more bitcoin-friendly, and public interest is growing. With these tailwinds, 2025 may well see continued price appreciation. Numbers like $250,000 and $475,000 are often shared. Chamath Palihapitiya has modeled a price for bitcoin of $500,000 to $1.14 million over the course of the current halving epoch, which ends in 2028. With so many variables affecting the price, it’s hard to set any solid expectations. Luckily, we don’t have to – bitcoin is an asset that is best used to build generational wealth slowly and steadily over the long term. Bitcoin’s CAGR is about 25% to 40% over a five year period. This means that price action, even over the course of two or three years, should be considered short-term. The best way to build wealth with bitcoin is to put aside money you do not need to access for at least five years, and set up a savings strategy that’s customized to your needs. The extraordinary events of 2024 have made one thing abundantly clear: bitcoin is a household name that’s here to stay. Its monetary properties offer a resilience and reliability that no other asset can. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Jim Cramer on Visa Inc. (V): ‘I’m Waiting For Visa To Come Down At A Discount’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Financial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. Before and after the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier this month, Jim Cramer had plenty to say on the subject matter. Ahead of the Fed's announcement, the CNBC host wondered why investors were reading too much into the Fed's interest rate cut decisions. In an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer stated that it wasn't clear to him why "people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." Another pressing issue that's caught his attention is the incoming Trump Administration's proposed tariffs against China and other US trading partners. He linked tariffs with interest rate cuts and the consumer price index (CPI) or inflation. One of the biggest concerns among analysts and economists, when it comes to tariffs, is the extent to which they might influence prices. Cramer believes that the Fed might not cut interest rates if the tariffs cause prices to rise. On the flip side, he added that if there aren't any tariffs or if the incoming administration is selective about them, then the housing market might pick up again and auto sales could rise. Additionally, Cramer also speculated that even if the tariffs did cause inflation, "a year we’ll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that’s over." As a result, he believes that investors should focus more on the Trump administration's policies instead of the Fed. "Why do we have to focus so much on what’s going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?” he asked. The need to focus on the Fed did become clear soon after Cramer's comments. In a highly watched mid-December decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that while his organization was cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, it might cut rates just twice in 2025 as opposed to the earlier guidance of four cuts. On the day Chair Powell updated investors about the bank's outlook, the flagship S&P, the Dow, and the broader NASDAQ stock indexes lost 2.95%, 2.58%, and 3.56%, respectively. Cramer, unsurprisingly, wasn't short on words when it came to dissecting the Fed's decision. Speaking on Mad Money on the day of the rate cut, he shared that Powell was caught off guard by having to fulfill market expectations of an interest rate cut that might not be justified given the strength of the US economy. According to Cramer, when it came to the rate cut the "data didn’t back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” The next day, he shared that it would have been better if the Fed hadn't "set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut." Yet, even though Cramer believes that America's economic strength did not warrant an interest rate cut, he isn't convinced that the economy is strong all over. On Squawk on the Street ahead of the interest rate cut, Cramer wondered where the Atlanta Fed had gotten its 3.2% US GDP growth estimate for Q4. “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong,” he outlined and added that he's "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where" the GDP is growing by 3.2%. Cramer speculated "travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Cramer's comments about the economy and the Fed's future actions are particularly important when we talk about financial services stocks. These firms typically do well when consumer spending isn't constrained by inflation and interest rates are low to facilitate business lending, deal-making, and other activities. For a detailed look at how Trump's win could affect the banking sector, you should check out 10 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For the Long Term. Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about financial stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out financial stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a modern payments terminal with a pile of credit cards on the side. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 165 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 10-07-24/10-08-24 Performance Since Then: 14.8% Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the largest credit card processor in the US as it commands 61% of the US market by purchase volume. As a result, the stock is dependent on consumer spending strength and low rates to drive higher transaction volumes. Higher spending led Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to beat analyst revenue estimates of $9.49 billion in Q3 by posting $9.62 billion. Its shares soared by 2.9% after the earnings and then gained another 4.8% after President-elect Trump's victory in the November election. Over the long term, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) might have to pick up the pace with its global expansion efforts to counter the threat of fintech upstarts eating away its market share. The firm is also being sued by the Justice Department for alleged monopolistic practices and is on the backfoot when it comes to a $30 billion settlement with merchants. Here's what Cramer said in October: “… Look, it sells at 27 times earnings. I’m waiting for Visa to come down at a discount. You don’t have that. Right now, I have to tell you, Mastercard is actually doing a little better than Visa. But no, no need to add a position on that. That’s not the right basis. Just keep looking. It’s a great long-term stock and I think it always will be as long as this is well run as it is now.” Overall V ranks 1st on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:BRK-B) is Warren Buffett's investment holding company with stakes in a variety of businesses. The firm's largest business is its insurance division closely followed by its utility and energy operations. Despite the well-diversified business model with stakes in railroad, construction, and energy, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) nevertheless depends on robust economic performance for its share price gains. Therefore, it was unsurprising that the stock fell by 2% after the Fed's interest rate decisions and soared by 5.4% after the November election. Here's what Cramer said in September: "When is it a bad time to buy Berkshire? Buy some tomorrow. I think it’s terrific. Then, wait until it comes down and buy some more."

Title: The Glaring Hypocrisy and Embedded Deceptions of the Global Food Giants
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/deceptions-global-food-giants/5875934
Time Published: 2024-12-29T18:19:41Z
Full Content:
Bryce Martinez (18) from Pennsylvania is mounting a legal challenge against major food companies, alleging that their ultra-processed foods (UPFs) led to his development of Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at the age of 16. The 11 firms listed in the lawsuit are Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, Post Holdings, PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestle’s (US), WK Kellogg, Mars, Kellanova and Conagra. UPFs have undergone multiple processing steps and often contain additives, preservatives and artificial ingredients. These UPFs have become staples in many households. Examples of UPFs are prepackaged soups, many breakfast cereals, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals, hot dogs, sausages, sodas, ice cream and store-bought cookies, cakes, candies and doughnuts. Martinez’s legal team contends that the big food corporations have deliberately engineered their products to trigger addictive responses. His lawyers at Morgan & Morgan, a major US law firm, says the case is unprecedented and includes claims for conspiracy, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation and unfair business practices. Martinez had regularly consumed popular UPFs throughout his childhood. The lawsuit challenges the food industry’s argument that consumers have free choice in their dietary decisions. It argues that the notion of free choice is compromised by aggressive marketing tactics, especially aimed at children, and the addictive nature of these products. UPFs are highly profitable for corporations. The same companies that dominate the UPF market are intertwined with investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which also hold stakes in the pharmaceutical industry. This dual investment creates a cycle where investment firms profit from both the sale of harmful foods and the treatment of diseases associated with these products. Furthermore, the prevailing economic system creates a paradoxical situation where workers, whose pension funds are often managed by these same investment giants, find themselves financially tethered to a cycle that undermines their own health and well-being. There is a famous quote often attributed to farmer, poet and campaigner Wendell Berry: “People are fed by the food industry, which pays no attention to health, and are treated by the health industry, which pays no attention to food.” For a long time, that has served both industry’s interests very well. The influence that giant corporations have on the food system is encapsulated by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Presenting itself as an independent scientific organisation, across the world, from China to India, the ILSI plays a crucial role in promoting narratives that benefit its corporate funders. According to the report Partnership for an Unhealthy Planet (Corporate Accountability, 2020), political interference by food and beverage transnationals like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nestlé and PepsiCo is pervasive. The report shows how these corporations have leveraged the ILSI to cripple progress on nutrition policy across the globe. After documenting that the ILSI has spun a complex web of revolving doors or partnering with leading research institutions in India (including “controlling” the Niti Aayog, the Government of India’s policy think tank) to denigrate traditional diets, the report states: “ILSI India is emblematic of how ILSI at large ensures that the food and beverage industry are able to deepen their capture of public policy and discourse thereabouts across the globe. One such example of this is an ILSI-sponsored study on sugar consumption by two of India’s most respected research entities, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Nutrition.” It adds: “… the study’s intent seems to be the absolution of food products marketed by ILSI’s corporate backers and/or redirection of public dietary concerns toward the traditional foods ILSI’s funders would hope to supplant.” The ILSI generates scientific data and provides it to state agencies, working to harmonise food regulations and facilitate international trade, not least by shaping Codex standards and guidelines. It has a notable influence on Codex through its collaborations with regulatory bodies involved in setting food safety standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission is an international organisation jointly run by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its published goals are to develop and adopt uniform food standards for its member countries and to promote the free and unhindered international flow of food goods, thereby eliminating trade barriers to food and (supposedly) providing food safety. Biotechnology, pesticides, food additives and contaminants are some of the issues discussed in Codex meetings. The FAO says: “Codex standards are based on the best available science assisted by independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO.” Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation. It decides on minimum food residue levels for pesticides, allowable amounts of aluminium, lead and arsenic in food and which substances or products are dangerous. These decisions affect the products and markets of huge corporations that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. The ILSI has infiltrated key national and international food and health regulatory and decision-making bodies in an attempt to lobby away or discredit any potential decision that may affect their bottom line (see The opaque world of Codex Alimentarius and Monsanto ‘toxic’ relations). According to Ivica Kelam of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek in Croatia: “The ILSI enjoys close relationships with regulatory bodies including the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives and the European Food Safety Authority, which rely on the substantial resources controlled by the ILSI. The organisation not only influences Codex standards through direct cooperation with national and international regulators but also indirectly through the networks it develops.” Funders of the ILSI have included at some point Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Mars, Mondelez, General Mills, Nestle, Kellogg, Hershey, Kraft, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Starbucks Coffee, Monsanto, CropLife International, Syngenta, Dow AgroSciences, Pioneer Hi-Bred, Bayer CropScience, BASF, Cargill, Unilever and Campbell Soup (see the reports Pushing partnerships: corporate influence on research and policy via the International Life Sciences Institute and ILSI is a food industry lobby group). Bryce Martinez is up against some very powerful forces that will do everything they possibly can to stave off any challenge that could potentially represent a critical threat to their power, profits and practices. In late 2020, the Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI) released a report that described how Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nestlé and PepsiCo used the COVID event to aggressively market UPFs. In Brazil, Nestlé, Bauducco and Danone donated more than 400 tons of food, including UFPs deemed unhealthy according to official Brazilian dietary guidelines. In South Africa, Coca-Cola donated soft drinks to families in townships and multiple healthcare centres. The GHAI notes that big food corporations also touted their unhealthy UPFs as essential, safe products and immune boosters. In Brazil, The ILSI cynically promoted processed foods as allies in the fight against COVID. In Japan, Coca-Cola encouraged people to exercise at home while ‘in quarantine’ through online exercise videos, pledging to donate up to one million drinks to app users who tracked 1,000 steps a day. In Brazil, McDonalds posted videos on X showing kids pressuring their parents to go to McDonalds during ‘quarantine’ to safely pick up food through the contactless drive thru. The report highlighted how the lack of healthy food regulations worldwide enabled these corporations to polish their public images while undermining public health. The reality is that research indicates diets high in UPFs may undermine immunity through several mechanisms, primarily related to nutrient deficiencies, inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiome. The GHAI says that the very companies who had already contributed to rising rates of obesity and diet-related diseases exploited the COVID event to position themselves and their products as “essential” while also, directly and indirectly, influencing public health policy. A peer-reviewed study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) was associated with more than 10 per cent of all-cause premature, preventable deaths in Brazil in 2019. UPFs have steadily replaced the consumption of traditional whole foods, such as rice and beans, in Brazil (see also the report Free trade and Mexico’s junk food epidemic). In high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, UPFs account for more than half of total calorific intake, a much higher figure than that for Brazil. And it is the poorer sections of society that rely more on UPF items because of their low cost. Yet corporate-backed narratives often downplay these risks or frame them as issues of personal responsibility rather than systemic problems. Studies have associated UPFs with significant increased risks of cardiovascular disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure and abnormal blood lipid levels, anxiety and mental disorders, depression and cognitive decline and impairment. There is also increased risk of certain cancers, particularly ovarian and breast cancers. (See this, this, this and this.) The GHAI report described how the very corporations that have driven the spiralling public health crisis to alarming levels were using an event framed as a public health emergency to their advantage. Their cynicism and hypocrisy are impossible to ignore. What was once nature’s gift (wholesome food) has been transformed to become an industrial commodity. As UPS have come to increasingly dominate diets and wreak havoc on human health, profit margins are boosted and consumers are regarded as mere collateral damage to be rinsed for further profit by the ‘healthcare’ industry.

Ahead of the Fed's announcement, the CNBC host wondered why investors were reading too much into the Fed's interest rate cut decisions. In an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer stated that it wasn't clear to him why "people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." Another pressing issue that's caught his attention is the incoming Trump Administration's proposed tariffs against China and other US trading partners. He linked tariffs with interest rate cuts and the consumer price index (CPI) or inflation. One of the biggest concerns among analysts and economists, when it comes to tariffs, is the extent to which they might influence prices. Cramer believes that the Fed might not cut interest rates if the tariffs cause prices to rise. On the flip side, he added that if there aren't any tariffs or if the incoming administration is selective about them, then the housing market might pick up again and auto sales could rise. Additionally, Cramer also speculated that even if the tariffs did cause inflation, "a year we’ll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that’s over." As a result, he believes that investors should focus more on the Trump administration's policies instead of the Fed. "Why do we have to focus so much on what’s going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?” he asked. The need to focus on the Fed did become clear soon after Cramer's comments. In a highly watched mid-December decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that while his organization was cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, it might cut rates just twice in 2025 as opposed to the earlier guidance of four cuts. On the day Chair Powell updated investors about the bank's outlook, the flagship S&P, the Dow, and the broader NASDAQ stock indexes lost 2.95%, 2.58%, and 3.56%, respectively. Cramer, unsurprisingly, wasn't short on words when it came to dissecting the Fed's decision. Speaking on Mad Money on the day of the rate cut, he shared that Powell was caught off guard by having to fulfill market expectations of an interest rate cut that might not be justified given the strength of the US economy. According to Cramer, when it came to the rate cut the "data didn’t back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” The next day, he shared that it would have been better if the Fed hadn't "set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut." Yet, even though Cramer believes that America's economic strength did not warrant an interest rate cut, he isn't convinced that the economy is strong all over. On Squawk on the Street ahead of the interest rate cut, Cramer wondered where the Atlanta Fed had gotten its 3.2% US GDP growth estimate for Q4. “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong,” he outlined and added that he's "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where" the GDP is growing by 3.2%. Cramer speculated "travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Cramer's comments about the economy and the Fed's future actions are particularly important when we talk about financial services stocks. These firms typically do well when consumer spending isn't constrained by inflation and interest rates are low to facilitate business lending, deal-making, and other activities.

Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about financial stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out financial stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A young business woman in a suit, discussing the fundamentals of asset management with an experienced colleague. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 50 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-06-24 Performance Since Then: 26.90% Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is a global asset management giant with $43 billion in assets and $1.1 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter. Like other asset managers, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) benefits from lower rates as they increase merger and deal-making activities and also increase liquidity in markets. The tailwinds from a lower interest rate regime are also evident in the firm's stock which is up 35.7% year-to-date. Specifically, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX)'s shares soared by 7.9% in October after the firm's $1.01 billion in earnings per share beat analyst estimates of $0.92. The beat came on the back of heightened capital markets activity, and it followed Cramer's mixed optimism during the previous month: "Near term, I don’t have a lot of conviction. Blackstone has had a very big run, from the 120s to the 130s. Longer term, I think Jonathan Gray and his team are simply brilliant, and their actions this week in the data center are very strong. I like it.” Overall BX ranks 7th on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of BX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG.DE) a Good German Dividend Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) stands against the other German dividend stocks. Europe's economy might see some positive developments in 2025, but risks still loom. Strong U.S. growth could boost demand for EU exports while easing inflation in Europe may lead the ECB to cut interest rates, spurring investment and economic growth. A potential increase in U.S. fossil fuel production could lower global oil prices, benefiting oil-importing countries like those in the EU. Additionally, US tax cuts might strengthen the dollar, making European goods more competitive globally. However, the EU's growth prospects hinge on geopolitical stability. Escalations in conflicts like the war in Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East, or a possible China-Taiwan crisis could derail this cautiously optimistic outlook. Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs Research is optimistic about European stocks in 2025, expecting the European index to deliver around a 9% total return, despite challenges like political uncertainty and slow economic growth. In a recent discussion with Sharon Bell, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, she explained that while they've slightly lowered their forecasts for the index, European stocks could still benefit from cooling inflation and a robust policy response. The team downgraded their targets due to weaker economic data and rising risks in countries like France and Italy. However, they believe the situation isn't as dire as past crises. They see potential in sectors like telecoms and real estate, which may thrive as interest rates are expected to drop to 1.75% by mid-2025. This expected drop in rates could also favor smaller, more indebted companies, which might benefit from increased mergers and acquisitions. However, these companies remain vulnerable to weak economic growth. Bell pointed out that a declining euro could enhance the competitiveness of European companies by reducing costs, though it might also discourage foreign investment. Furthermore, European firms heavily rely on sales from the US and China, as domestic sales within Europe have stagnated over the past two decades. In this context, lower interest rates could help stimulate economic growth and drive higher valuations for European stocks. However, Goldman Sachs remains cautious about the scale of this growth, particularly given persistent inflation concerns. While U.S. equities have recently outperformed their European counterparts, a shift in US valuations could make Europe a more attractive option for global investors. Supporting this outlook, dividends are emerging as a key contributor to European equity returns. For European companies, the average yield was 3.47% at the end of 2023 and it was projected to increase to 3.67% in 2024, remaining higher than long-term German government bond yields despite their significant rise in 2022. German companies reported a 3.3% dividend yield in 2023, which was expected to grow to 3.53% in 2024. The Allianz Global Investors Dividend Study highlighted the significance of dividends in equity investment returns. Over the past 40 years, dividends have accounted for nearly 36% of the annualized total return of European equities. Our Methodology For this article, we used the iShares DivDAX® UCITS ETF (DE) to filter out German dividend stocks. The ETF aims to replicate the performance of an index comprising 15 high dividend yield stocks selected from the 30 largest and most actively traded companies on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Prime Standard segment. From this fund, we focused on picking prominent stocks with stable yields and strong dividend policies. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of December 27. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) An overhead view of a factory floor, teeming with robotic arms assembling cars. Dividend Yield as of December 27: 9.92% Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE), headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, develops, manufactures, and sells cars and vans under brands like Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG, Mercedes-Maybach, and G-Class. It also offers spare parts, financing, leasing, rentals, fleet management, insurance, and digital services for charging and payments. With an impressive dividend yield of 9.92% as of December 27, Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) is one of the best German dividend stocks to buy. Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) reported revenue of €107,144 million for the first nine months of 2024, slightly below the €112,414 million from the prior year, due to lower unit sales, an unfavorable market mix, negative pricing, and exchange rate effects. In February 2024, the company announced a share buyback policy, allocating free cash flow beyond a 40% dividend payout to fund share buybacks. A €3 billion buyback program began in May 2024, following the completion of a €4 billion program in August 2024. The current program is expected to finish by Q1 2025, with future buybacks subject to corporate approvals. At its Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG (XETRA:MBG.DE) approved a dividend of €5.30 per share for 2023, up from €5.20 in 2022. The total payout for 2023 amounted to €5.5 billion, slightly below the €5.6 billion distributed in 2022. Overall MBG.DE ranks 2nd on our list of the best German dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MBG.DE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: How Return Of Capital Can Lead Closed-End Fund Investors Astray
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/29/how-return-of-capital-can-lead-closed-end-fund-investors-astray/
Time Published: 2024-12-29T15:36:00Z
Full Content:
Confused middle aged 60s woman in glasses The other day, we broke down how return of capital (ROC) can be both good and bad for investors in 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs). But in the case of high-quality CEFs, ROC is, contrary to what most people think, a good thing. Today we’re going to look at some real-world examples to explain how, in fact, return of capital can make up a large share of a fund’s returns. To do so, we’re going to go into five Nuveen funds, the Nuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX), Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX) and Nuveen Core Equity Alpha Fund (JCE). Except for JCE, which I’ll get to in a moment, these are all covered-call funds that hold the index to which they correspond, then sell call options on part of that index, to essentially “translate” volatility into income for investors. These four funds have strong records of doing this, with all but DIAX up over 100% in the last decade (DIAX, in orange below, is the laggard here, up 86.4%, largely because its index rises more slowly than those tracked by SPXX, BXMX and QQQX). Fund Performance These types of funds have a place in a diversified portfolio as a way to collect income, especially since they yield 7.2% on average. That’s obviously much more than the paltry 1.3% the average S&P 500 stock pays, as of this writing. The funny thing about that big yield is that it tends to attract naysayers who will tell you that these funds are just charging fees and giving you back your capital, hence the vast majority of their returns are labeled as return of capital (see right-hand column below). Return of Capital Percentage In BXMX’s case, 91.3% of the distribution is classed as ROC, while SPXX is a tad higher and QQQX is a tad lower, with DIAX far behind, at 69.5%. JCE appears to be the best of the bunch here, with 25.5% of distributions being ROC. To be clear, these funds are not just giving you back your capital, as their healthy profits over the last decade prove. We discussed the technicalities of this in Thursday’s article. Now I want to focus on using ROC as an investment signal for these funds. Already we can tell that ROC is not a useful signal, since DIAX has been the worst performer for a decade, but its ROC ratio is lower than those of BXMX, SPXX and QQQX. However, this doesn’t mean we should go to the opposite extreme and say more ROC is the sign of a good fund: JCE’s much smaller portion of ROC coincides with it outperforming all of these covered-call funds in 2024, with a 24.6% return year to date, as of this writing. The reason why JCE has outrun the rest isn’t down to the ROC amounts—it’s because, unlike the others, this is an actively managed fund, meaning management can buy and sell stocks as they see fit. So they can, for instance, lower the fund’s exposure to NVIDIA (NVDA) when that stock shoots up in price. That’s unlike QQQX, which needs to buy more NVIDIA shares as the stock rises in price and thus becomes a bigger portion of the NASDAQ 100, which QQQX tracks. That’s also why JCE has done better than all of these covered-call funds combined over the last decade, returning 179% versus the covered-call funds’ average 103.6% return. So we can see that one of the real keys to maximizing profits and income in CEFs isn’t obsessing over ROC, but instead focusing on indicators like portfolio quality, management and historical performance. This is especially true when we compare funds of different types: JCE is not a covered-call fund, so the nature of its profits to investors is fundamentally different from those funds, since income from selling call options is recognized as capital gains. What’s more, selling call options also means you’ll sometimes have stocks that are down in price be sold, or “called away,” resulting in the fund realizing losses that offset the capital gains it received from selling the call options. This is also why covered-call funds tend to underperform over the long haul, especially if they are more passively managed, as our four covered-call funds are. The key takeaway here is that if you’re shopping for a CEF, do yourself a favor and ignore the chatter about ROC, so much of which is misinformed and confused. In reality, ROC is more often than not an advantage, because it amounts to tax-free income for American shareholders. And that means using funds that maximize ROC can be a great way to offset gains elsewhere or to boost income without boosting your tax burden. That’s a great reason why, despite their slight underperformance, funds like QQQX and SPXX might actually give you a higher net profit than a fund that has a higher return on paper, like JCE.

There was substantial innovation, but those just wanting to make money from investing in Ethereum's native coin ETH are a little disappointed—if the vibes on Crypto Twitter (aka X) are anything to go by. Upgrades like Dencun made it cheaper to get things done on the network, and President-elect Donald Trump even threw his weight behind a project built on Ethereum. But there was also a regulatory crackdown, leading many to think that the SEC was coming hard for the ecosystem. The surprising approval of spot ETH exchange-traded funds turned things around, but did not lead to an explosion in the asset’s price like it did with its Bitcoin counterparts. pic.twitter.com/ypp2wE4GLa — naiive (@naiivememe) November 14, 2024 Even so, it was still an exciting—and noteworthy—year for the blockchain behind the second-biggest coin in crypto. Here's a look back at how it all went down. In April, rumors started swirling that the SEC could be coming after Ethereum in its entirety after the Ethereum Foundation announced it was being investigated by a state authority. Then, Wall Street’s top regulator and one of the biggest names in the Ethereum space, software giant Consensys (disclosure: one of 22 investors in Decrypt), went to war. It started when the SEC hit the firm with a Wells notice, a warning of an impending lawsuit over securities violations, regarding its popular Ethereum wallet, MetaMask. Consensys snapped back with a preemptive suit against the SEC. The company alleged that the agency had secretly considered ETH to be a security for over a year, claiming that the regulator’s actions “would punish Consensys for accepting and acting in reliance on years of government assurance that ETH is not a security.” Then, the SEC sued Consensys for allegedly engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through its MetaMask Swaps and Staking services. The Consensys lawsuit was thrown out by a judge in September. Trump winning has been both good and bad for the firm: The SEC will have a new, pro-crypto chairman if Trump's pick Paul Atkins is confirmed, but not before Consensys has had to cut its staff by 20% in October. The firm cited aggressive regulation and lawsuits as part of the reason. After the expected approval and huge debut trading months of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, industry observers didn’t think Ethereum would get the same green light—at least not right away—because the regulator wasn’t clear on whether the asset was a security or commodity. But in a surprise move, the SEC gave a thumbs-up. And two months after initial approvals, the spot ETFs began trading in July. But despair seemed to set in when the ETH price didn’t go up. The approval of the Bitcoin ETFs had pushed the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high after all-time high. ETH hasn’t been so lucky: As of this writing, it still has a sizable gap to close until it breaks its 2021 record of $4,878. Even if Ethereum's price didn’t take off like a rocket, the approval of the ETFs delivered one important win: The SEC stopped calling ETH a securit. Despite previously saying in 2018 that the asset was not a security, outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler for years refused to answer on where the coin stood—and he hit crypto company after crypto company with lawsuits for allegedly selling unregistered securities. But the approval of the ETFs showed that the watchdog essentially agreed that the asset was decentralized enough to not be a security. This came with Wall Street recognition of ETH and its blockchain as an asset class—even if traditional finance has had a hard time getting its head around Ethereum’s value proposition. It helped that the really big names, like BlackRock boss Larry Fink, generated some momentum. The BlackRock CEO kicked off the year by saying that he saw “value” in an Ethereum ETF, and that it was a stepping stone towards “tokenization.” In March, the asset manager launched “BUIDL”—a tokenized fund running on Ethereum—and then later joined the fray with its own spot ETF. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned hard ahead of his victory to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” As part of his digital asset-focused agenda, he helped launch a project running on… you guessed it, Ethereum. First teased in August by his son, Eric, World Liberty Financial is a decentralized finance project. Decentralized finance—or DeFi—is the crypto sphere that wants to make taking out a loan or lending automatic and easy via blockchain-based protocols. Most DeFi projects are built upon Ethereum, so it’s not a huge surprise that the Trump team went with the project, but still—it was big news for the community. WLF will provide borrowing and lending crypto services, the team behind the project said in an exclusive interview with Decrypt’s sister company, Rug Radio. The project launched and had a somewhat sluggish token launch—open only to accredited investors—but it’s still early days. Sources tell Decrypt that Team Trump also has plans to launch a native stablecoin, though it's a crowded market indeed. On the technical side of things, Ethereum got cheaper too—much cheaper. The network’s Dencun upgrade slashed transaction costs on its layer-2 networks. Such networks enable faster and cheaper transactions than on mainnet, and Dencun's addition of "proto-danksharding" technology trimmed costs even further for users. That's the good news. On the flip side, rising use of L2s has drawn value away from layer-1 Ethereum, which some in the crypto space believe is responsible for Ethereum's sagging price performance this year. In fact, VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel said in October that unless Ethereum gets a "model change," he projects that ETH's price will only hit $7,300 by 2030—as opposed to $22,000 under previous projections. Layer-2 networks are "taking more value from Ethereum" than previously expected, he posited. Luckily, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and others in the space are considering changes, such as fee-sharing models, that can provide more balance to the ecosystem so L2s don't become overly extractive.

Title: Analyst: Micron Technology (MU) Problems Are ‘Very Temporal’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently making headlines on the back of latest analyst ratings and important news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 107 Matthew Bryson from Bright Lake Wealth Management said while talking to Schwab Network in a latest program that he believes Micron Technology’s (NASDAQ:MU) problems are temporary in nature. “I think that a lot of the problems are very temporal in nature. Certainly, the extent of the decline was a bit of a surprise. But where you’ve got inventory right-sizing in handsets of smartphones, that’s not an end-market problem. It’s that our customers took on too much inventory, mostly late 2023. It just needs to get worked out, and I think that’s done by the end of Q1. How can Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) make a turnaround? The company’s management expects PC unit growth to accelerate into the second half of calendar 2025. Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell has only just begun ramping up production and 2025 is expected to show improved sequential and annual comparisons. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) management has also guided for a return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year and raised the estimate of the HBM market’s total addressable market to over $30 billion in 2025, driven by their sold-out position for the calendar year. Based on these factors, now could be the right time for long-term investors to pile into MU. Invesco Growth and Income Fund stated the following regarding Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU): In late June, Micron reported earnings that were generally in line with expectations. However, management provided weaker guidance going forward. The stock immediately began to sell off, which continued through the third quarter as investors appeared to question the company’s long-term growth outlook. Rotation out of AI-related stocks also appeared to weigh on Micron Technology.” Overall, MU ranks 5th on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why does Wall Street think Netflix stock will plunge 10%?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The holiday season is a time for deep reflection. And for me this year, that has meant reflecting on some of my favorite stocks and leaders to follow. Netflix (NFLX) has come to the forefront of my mind as the year winds down, in part after seeing Beyoncé ride out on a majestic white horse during one of Netflix's Christmas Day football games. Legend. "The game was a home run as far as they're concerned," Manhattan Venture Partners head of research Santosh Rao said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief (video above). "I think this was a great home run for the ad business that they have." Netflix hosted its first two NFL games that day, hot on the heels of the glitchy — but still enjoyable to watch — Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing spectacle in November. The other reason Netflix is on my mind is because the hotly anticipated Season 2 of "Squid Game" premiered on Thursday, and the characters in the pink jumpsuits and black face masks are dominating my X feed. The second installment has gotten mixed reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but people still tuned in en masse. Doing a little analysis in the wake of these events, it looks like Wall Street is still too bearish on Netflix — even with the stock up 86% year to date. Perhaps this group thinks Netflix is that young streaming company from years ago, burning money and raising debt to fund content investments. Here is the bearishness I am seeing in the numbers, compliments of data from the Yahoo Finance platform: The average sell-side analyst price target on Netflix is $838, 10% below current price levels. This is totally out of whack with a company that has demolished analyst profit forecasts at every stop in 2024. 44% of sell-side analysts rate the stock at Underperform or Sell. The average analyst earnings per share estimate for 2025 models Netflix only posting 20% earnings growth. The reality is that Netflix looks positioned for another monster year in 2025, which may win over more Wall Street skeptics and support another push higher in stock price. Netflix has not only arrived on the live sports scene — it has smashed the wall down. This likely means two things: First, the streaming movement around live events will accelerate further as legacy media continues to buckle and cut back more, and second, Netflix's ad dollars are locked in on a significantly higher trajectory. Just look at these numbers. More than 200 countries tuned in at some point during the Chiefs vs. Steelers game, according to NFL Media data. The game is the second-most-popular live title on Netflix to date. Additionally, 60 million households watched the Tyson vs. Paul fight. These are huge numbers that validate Netflix's investments in live sports — which includes the debut of WWE in January. "Given the success of the Tyson/Paul fight we expect Netflix to accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming, which further enhances Netflix's ability to offer households regular compelling content (juiced by the fact their competitors are now selling previously exclusive content to Netflix) = likely lower subscriber churn and greater ability to take price," Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote. Wlodarczak is Wall Street's biggest Netflix bull, with a $1,100 price target on the stock. Wlodarczak's call-out of price increases is important. In October, Netflix raised prices for basic and premium services by $2 and $3, respectively. The hikes will likely enhance sales and profits in 2025. With the live sports and events push underway (including a deal to broadcast the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031) and compelling traditional Netflix content such as "Squid Game" being churned out, it's inevitable the company raises prices again within the next 12 to 18 months. See more: Why Disney doesn't want to sell its TV network That will only enhance Netflix's impressive free cash flow story. Netflix will haul in close to $7 billion in free cash flow this year, according to analyst estimates. Pivotal's Wlodarczak thinks Netflix's free cash flow will reach $23.5 billion by 2030. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. A company hits the free cash flow mark by being profitable and prudently investing those profits into "stuff" like plants and equipment. The cash left over could then be used to further bolster the total return potential for investors by way of stock buybacks or dividend increases. Recall that from 2015 to 2019, Netflix had a negative cash flow of $10.5 billion. The company went free cash flow positive in 2020 with $1.9 billion in free cash as the COVID-19 pandemic fueled bumper profits, followed by a $132 million free cash outflow in 2021. But those days are over. Last year, the company brought in $6.9 billion in free cash after reporting $1.6 billion in free cash flow in 2022. And Netflix's free cash flow build will only allow it to feed its content flywheel at the same time that legacy media continues cutbacks. This is how competitive moats are built. In the end, Netflix could conceivably generate north of $25 in earnings per share next year — well ahead of current analyst estimates of about $23.81. Slap a premium price-earnings multiple on the stock of 40 times (it's currently at 38 times), and Netflix could have a path to trading above $1,000 a share in 2025. "I think [the stock is still undervalued] absolutely because there's still a long runway ahead," Rao said. "They're just getting into live sports, and there are so many other live sports they can get into." "They're going to pull people into their ecosystem," Rao continued, pointing to cricket and soccer as other opportunities for Netflix live sports. "So the [subscriber] growth is going to be strong. To a large extent, it's priced in, but there is a lot more to come ahead because they are the only game in town in terms of excellent streaming services and the broad breadth of offerings." Rao sees at least a 15% upside left in Netflix shares. Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Title: Analysts Predict 400% Upside Potential for This Penny Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Cellectis SA (CLLS, Financial), a pioneer in gene-editing technology, is generating excitement on Wall Street, as analysts believe there is about 400% upside potential over its current prices. The current price is only $1.41 per share, and this under-the-radar cancer therapy has caught the eye of eight analysts who average a price target of $7.00 with a range of estimates from $3.00 to a really bullish $11.00. The company is working on the TALEN- TALEN-based gene Editing and is developing its pipeline Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CLLS. Key indications in the allogeneic CAR-T portfolio are UCART22, which UCART20x22 will support for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, respectively. They have designed these therapies to be off-the-shelf solutions, seriously advancing the field of reducing the cost and complexity involved with cell therapy. To continue investing in their pipeline, Cellectis has engaged with AstraZeneca to deliver cell and innovative gene therapies. This agreement signified a strong technology prowess for the company to make discovery-aided breakthroughs in genetic research and treatment solutions. Analysts are optimistic due to the strategic positioning of Cellectis in the flourishing category of personalized medicine, which is rapidly gaining greater relevance in the global health landscape. Yet, like most penny stocks, such investment comes with certain risks using regulatory hurdles and clinical outcomes on successful trials. For risk-savvy investors, Cellectis is a high-stakes gamble in the gene-editing arena. As this develops and merges further in partnerships, the company might become very well positioned to revolutionize treatment for cancers and make its current valuation look like a bargain in the years ahead.

Title: The ‘Virus Is Spreading’—Bitcoin Suddenly Braced For A ‘Major’ 2025 Price Move

Bitcoin has rocketed higher through 2024, though a serious Federal Reserve warning has sparked fears of an imminent crash. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price topped $100,000 per bitcoin on the back of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory, described as a "tipping point" for crypto after Wall Street embraced spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Now, as BlackRock confirms a worrying bitcoin price bombshell, the bitcoin price has been predicted to be just weeks away from a "major" move as fresh bitcoin ETF filings are revealed. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's favorable attitude toward bitcoin and crypto is predicted to ... [+] help drive the bitcoin price higher in 2025. "If it’s true that a lot of the market makers are exposed to bitcoin given how much price movement there has been, then we’re only weeks away from the next major move," bitcoin and crypto investor Mike Alfred said during an X broadcast this week with podcaster Scott Melker, pointing to Friday's largest-ever bitcoin options expiry. Bitcoin's Wall Street adoption this year has been led by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock after its successful campaign to bring bitcoin ETFs to the U.S. last year, with the funds making their debut in January. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now has around $60 billion in assets under management, becoming one of the fastest growing ETFs ever. This week, two new ETFs designed to build on the growing trend of corporations adopting bitcoin treasuries were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF would invest in companies that have "adopted the 'bitcoin standard,'" defined as holding more than 1,000 bitcoin and meeting certain size and liquidity requirements. "I think in 2025, you’re going to see an explosion of interest in index space strategies that give diversified exposure to crypto," Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told Bloomberg this week. "Of course, [that is] something we’ve been doing at Bitwise since 2017 when we pioneered that concept. I think 2025 is when that becomes a mainstream way to allocate to this space, the same way it is to stocks and bonds and real estate and everything else." Meanwhile, Strive, an asset manager cofounded by Vivek Ramaswamy who will lead the Trump administration's Doge department of government efficiency with Elon Musk, has filed to create the Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF, designed to provide "exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy ... or other companies that Strive ... expects will invest all or a significant portion of the proceeds to purchase bitcoin (collectively, 'bitcoin bonds')."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Car Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) stands against the other car stocks. The automotive industry has witnessed a constant churn of innovation over the last several decades, with car makers continuously providing drivers with new features. However, there has been a different pace of change lately, with the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) being the most talked-of topic in the industry. READ ALSO: 10 Best Used Car Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now. A lot of the conversations in the automotive space currently revolve around robotaxis, the autonomous taxis for ride-hailing, especially after Elon Musk unveiled the Cybercab in October this year. His company is showcasing the self-driving two-seater at several key locations across the United States in December, with plans to deploy the autonomous services in California and Texas in 2025. According to a report in Euro News, global EV sales surged in November, with a record-breaking 1.8 million units sold worldwide, overtaking the record set in the prior month by 100,000 units. China accounted for two-thirds of the sales during the month. Around 15.2 million EVs were sold between January and November, growing 25% year-to-date. The report stated a 3% decline in EV sales in the region comprising the United Kingdom (UK), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). With 280,000 units sold in November, annual sales for the region reached 2.7 million units. However, the UK is having an improvement in the second half of the year; sales have grown 17% from last year, driven by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. China is not only leading the EV market but is also on track to take over the global auto industry because of its massive and growing capacity. Earlier this month, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) highlighted that the country’s EV capacity will soon match its domestic auto demand, whereas China’s car production capacity is already half of the global demand for automobiles. It is projected to have a total output of 20 million electric vehicles in 2024, with production increasing between 4-5 million units annually, helped by heavy investments from Chinese firms to expand production. According to the New York Times, China also has the capacity to produce over 40 million internal combustion engine cars a year. India’s auto market is also seeing impressive growth, contributing significantly to the global market. Annual production of automobiles in the country stood at 25.9 million units in fiscal 2023. The thriving vehicle market has also resulted in a booming auto components industry, which has grown 11.3% during the first half of FY25, driven by strong demand for larger and more powerful cars. We sifted through screeners to identify stocks in the auto manufacturers, auto parts, and auto dealerships industries. From there, we selected the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024. The 10 best car stocks to invest in now have been ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on hedge fund sentiment, we used a higher market cap as a tiebreaker between them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Based in Tempe, Arizona, the company operates an online platform to buy and sell used cars. In 2021, it was included in the Fortune 500 list, making it one of the youngest companies to be named in the list – just eight years after it was founded. The company experienced significant growth during the pandemic years, as the e-commerce industry boomed with restrictions on in-person shopping. However, CVNA’s fortunes suffered in 2022, burdened by high interest rates, rising costs of automobiles, and heavy debt. A year later, it turned things around again, with its share price increasing by over 1000%, driven by cost cuts and strategic debt restructuring. The growth story is still ongoing. As of December 26, its share price had surged by over 300% year-to-date, as the company focuses on enhancing operational efficiencies and cash flow. Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) is continuing to see strong demand for vehicles. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on October 30, the company reported a 34% increase in retail units sold from last year. Revenue for the quarter was $3.655 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Net income stood at $148 million, whereas operating income was posted at $337 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $429 million, with a margin of 11.7% – a new company record. EPS was logged at $0.64, beating expectations of 25 cents per share. Looking ahead, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) anticipates sequential growth in retail units sold in the fourth quarter of 2024 and adjusted EBITDA to be significantly above the high end of its previously communicated range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year. These forecasts have resulted in a bullish sentiment around the stock, with Wall Street analysts having a consensus Buy rating for CVNA. Hedge fund sentiment is improving as well. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 66 hedge funds held a stake in the company, up from 61 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now. Overall CVNA ranks 2nd on our list of the best car stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of CVNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A classic Ferrari sports car against a lush green hillside, symbolizing the company's luxurious performance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is an Italian designer, manufacturer, and retailer of luxury sports cars. It also produces limited series and one-off cars. The company is active in around 60 countries and territories through its network of authorized dealers. Following his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for automakers, due to their reliance on auto parts from these countries. While Europe has largely been absent from Trump’s protectionist policies, there are concerns the region might be next to face similar scrutiny. However, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) remains unfazed by the chatter. When asked at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on December 10 whether the company would consider manufacturing cars in the United States, CEO Benedetto Vigna stated that Ferrari will always make its cars in Maranello, northern Italy, and that will not change even if tariffs are introduced. Morningstar analyst Rella Suskin believes that, unlike its competitors in the industry, Ferrari’s high-end clientele and exclusive market allow the company to absorb high tariffs by adjusting prices without considerably impacting demand. Its order book is already strong, and the sports car maker is planning to launch its first fully electric vehicle by Q4 2025. Ferrari’s financial performance remained robust. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 5, the company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenues to EUR 1.6 billion ($1.68 billion), with a net profit of EUR 375 million ($394 million). The company is seeing order book visibility well into 2026, driven by impressive order intake for the 12Cilindri coupe Spider, and the unveiling of the F80 Supercar. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating for Ferrari with an average share price upside potential of 16%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has also improved. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 36 hedge funds held a stake in Ferrari, up from 30 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now.

From there, we selected the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024. The 10 best car stocks to invest in now have been ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on hedge fund sentiment, we used a higher market cap as a tiebreaker between them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A classic Ferrari sports car against a lush green hillside, symbolizing the company's luxurious performance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is an Italian designer, manufacturer, and retailer of luxury sports cars. It also produces limited series and one-off cars. The company is active in around 60 countries and territories through its network of authorized dealers. Following his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for automakers, due to their reliance on auto parts from these countries. While Europe has largely been absent from Trump’s protectionist policies, there are concerns the region might be next to face similar scrutiny. However, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) remains unfazed by the chatter. When asked at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on December 10 whether the company would consider manufacturing cars in the United States, CEO Benedetto Vigna stated that Ferrari will always make its cars in Maranello, northern Italy, and that will not change even if tariffs are introduced. Morningstar analyst Rella Suskin believes that, unlike its competitors in the industry, Ferrari’s high-end clientele and exclusive market allow the company to absorb high tariffs by adjusting prices without considerably impacting demand. Its order book is already strong, and the sports car maker is planning to launch its first fully electric vehicle by Q4 2025. Ferrari’s financial performance remained robust. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 5, the company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenues to EUR 1.6 billion ($1.68 billion), with a net profit of EUR 375 million ($394 million). The company is seeing order book visibility well into 2026, driven by impressive order intake for the 12Cilindri coupe Spider, and the unveiling of the F80 Supercar. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating for Ferrari with an average share price upside potential of 16%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has also improved. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 36 hedge funds held a stake in Ferrari, up from 30 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now. Overall RACE ranks 9th on our list of the best car stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of RACE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RACE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 7 Reasons Why 2025 Could Redefine Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/12/29/7-reasons-why-2025-could-redefine-crypto/
Time Published: 2024-12-29T11:30:00Z

Despite questions over regulation, lingering SEC lawsuits and scores of billion dollar zombie blockchain, bitcoin and the entire crypto market had a roaring comeback in 2024. Donald Trump at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, TN. (Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Crypto winter? Over. Fallen empires and courtroom drama? In the rearview. The survivors? Battle-tested and eyeing the horizon like it’s the next gold rush. After years of clashes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds have arrived. As of mid-December 16, U.S. bitcoin ETFs held $129 billion in assets, surpassing the $125 billion in gold ETFs, according to Norway-based K33 Research. A post-election cocktail of market euphoria and Donald Trump’s promises to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world” and establish a strategic bitcoin reserve sent bitcoin past $100,000. Solana is having a moment, fueled by memecoin hype and new categories like dePINs—networks that leverage blockchain tech to decentralize control and ownership of physical infrastructure. Platforms like Polymarket, where users bet on the outcome of U.S. presidential elections, and the battle royale game Off The Grid have found mainstream success. A new wave of “degens” are gambling on tokens like fartcoin and dogwifhat, both now with a market cap above $1 billion. “It’s the year that crypto moved into the mainstream consciousness in a way that it hadn’t since 2021, and that it is now a sustainable long-term asset class that is going to have a voice and is going to matter,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at Dragonfly, a San Francisco-based crypto venture capital firm. “If you look at just the effect that crypto had on the election—both as donors and in terms of bringing it forward in legislatures and for presidential candidates—that's never been done before and obviously a big step forward in legitimization.” With Trump and a cadre of crypto-friendly officials poised to take office, the stage is set for what insiders are already calling "crypto’s golden age." Here’s what’s brewing: The art of bold price prediction is back in vogue. Crypto asset manager Bitwise forecasts $200,000—or even $500,000—per bitcoin if the U.S. creates a strategic reserve akin to those for oil or gold. The logic: the U.S. official bitcoin stockpile would trigger global FOMO. Trump floated using 200,000 bitcoins confiscated from criminals (worth $21 billion) to jumpstart the reserve at the Nashville Bitcoin conference in July. But the legal pathway is murky—will it require Congressional approval, or can the executive branch act unilaterally? Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a Treasury-operated reserve in July. Skeptics argue the asset’s volatility could undermine financial stability. Trump's silence on whether the U.S. would acquire more bitcoin through open market purchases adds another layer of intrigue. The incoming administration is shaping up to be the most pro-crypto yet. Key appointments include: “There's a real opportunity to get good policy in place for the industry,” says Kristin Smith, CEO of Washington DC-based Blockchain Association, which represents more than 100 crypto companies. “The White House has indicated that this is a priority. I think we're going to see a combination of efforts across government, a legislative push for market structure and stablecoins and a big shift towards a lot of the innovation coming back to the US,” she adds. The pipeline of crypto IPOs is heating up. Bitwise names five companies likely to go public next year: Additionally, Dragonfly’s Hadick says, “I expect the LP market to get better—they’ll want to put more capital into crypto—and a lot of the traditional web 2 crossover funds return to the space. We are already starting to see it in certain pockets like stablecoins and payments.” But VC dealmaking tends to lag public market price rallies by a quarter or two, he adds. MicroStrategy’s stock is up over 400% this year. Now part of the Nasdaq 100, analysts predict S&P 500 inclusion is next thanks to new accounting rules that would allow it to reflect its bitcoin investments at market value in its financial statements. This change could usher MicroStrategy into index-tracking funds and hence the portfolios of countless U.S. investors. Cofounder and executive chairman Michael Saylor's "Bitcoin Treasury" play—selling bonds and equities to hoard the asset—has propelled his $86 billion enterprise into the ranks of the S&P 500's top 100 firms. Coinbase, up 70% this year, could also join the coveted index, according to analysts. The stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, potentially doubling to a $400 billion market cap as the U.S. edges closer to long-awaited stablecoin legislation. In 2024, stablecoin transactions’ volume reached $8.3 trillion, nearly matching Visa's $9.9 trillion in payment volume, according to Bitwise. Tether and Circle still reign supreme, riding the wave of high interest rates. However, if they continue to operate more like asset managers than payment companies, their growth could soon stall, cautioned Hadick. Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge in October sent a message—stablecoins could become cornerstones of fintech. Stripe hails them as “superconductors for financial services,” touting their unmatched speed, low cost, and global reach. Robinhood isn’t far behind with ambitions for a global stablecoin network. Meanwhile, next-generation “stablecoin 2.0” models are quietly gaining traction. “There are a bunch of new stablecoin models that are kicking back revenue to holders of the token, or actually the applications who onboard users,” explains Ceteris, head of research at New York-based crypto analytics firm Delphi Digital. “I could see those being disruptive.” Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been proselytizing tokenization for years. From real estate to art, everything might soon have a token. The big benefits: instantaneous settlement, lower costs than traditional securitization, round-the-clock liquidity and transparency. Three years ago, the crypto sector had only tokenized $2 billion in real-world assets (RWAs), including private credit, U.S. debt, commodities, and stocks. Today that figure is close to $14 billion. Venture capital firm ParaFi predicts that the tokenized RWA market could skyrocket to $2 trillion by 2030, heralding a significant transformation in asset ownership and trading. Buzzword of the month: AI agents. Get ready to witness the fusion of artificial intelligence and crypto in ways that feel closer to science fiction. The first shoots of this trend are already breaking ground. Look at TruthTerminal—an AI agent that not only pulled in $50,000 from Marc Andreessen but also became a millionaire by leveraging social media on X. Its success stemmed from promoting a coin based on an absurd early 2000s meme (the token’s anonymous creator(s) transferred a significant sum to TruthTerminal’s wallet, managed by creator Andy Ayrey). But analysts are wary. Practical AI agents—for example, those attempting to execute complex transactions across blockchains on behalf of users— are scarce and early. “Agents are exciting because they are so new,” says Delphi’s Ceteris, “but will probably be the biggest bubble of this cycle, for good and bad.” While the blockchain industry remains fragmented and most decentralized apps have not yet become mainstream, the work on a robust infrastructure continues. “Solana set the trend for the high throughput chain era (cryptospeak for blockchains capable of processing thousands of transactions per second similarly to Visa and MasterCard), and you're seeing nearly every new chain launch under this kind of umbrella so there’s going to be a lot of cheap block space,” Ceteris explains. And just like that, crypto's narrative has flipped from survival to euphoria. This is just a taste of what the next year could bring. Your choice: grab your popcorn for the show—or your wallet for the opportunity. Caution is essential. The market will swerve through inevitable highs and gut-check lows. And this time, the stakes seem to be higher than ever.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology’s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground. To compile our list of the 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies with a share price of under $10 as of December 24, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Share Price as of December 24: $5.69 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) is a leading American provider of communications technology and network infrastructure solutions. The company specializes in designing, manufacturing, and supporting the hardware and software that enable effective digital communication. In the third quarter of 2024, CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) reported net sales of $1.082 billion, a 3% increase from the previous year. The company’s core adjusted EBITDA reached $220 million, reflecting a remarkable 25% growth year-over-year. This performance was largely driven by the Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS) segment, which saw its adjusted EBITDA surge by 115% to $174 million. These results were supported by the strong demand from the hyperscale and cloud data center business as the industry’s need for bandwidth and data center capacity continues to rise. In the third quarter, the company approved an additional capacity expansion project to meet the increasing demand for data center solutions. These investments are anticipated to yield high returns with short payback periods. Strategically, CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) is refining its focus. In the third quarter of 2024, the company announced an agreement to divest its Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) business units. Such moves provide the company with greater flexibility to optimize its capital structure. By concentrating on its core businesses, which now include Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), Access Network Solutions (ANS), and Networking Intelligent Cellular Solutions (NICS), CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) aims to enhance profitability. Given these strong financial results and strategic initiatives, CommScope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) presents a promising investment opportunity. The company’s focus on core operations and capacity expansion positions it well for future growth in an increasingly connected world. Overall, COMM ranks 3rd on our list of the best low-priced technology stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of COMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Is EPR Properties (EPR) Among the Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-epr-properties-epr-among-104226177.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) stands against the other stocks that pay monthly dividends. Dividend stocks have long been a favorite among investors, regardless of the payout frequency. Companies, however, are deliberate in determining how often to reward their shareholders. Annual and semi-annual dividends might provide larger payouts, but their unpredictability can be challenging for investors. While major firms opt for quarterly payouts due to practicality, some choose monthly distributions, which many investors find attractive for the steady stream of passive income. In addition, a reduction in monthly payouts would have a smaller immediate impact, and receiving dividends monthly is one of the closest alternatives to a regular paycheck, simplifying the management of day-to-day finances. That said, history suggests that companies offering monthly dividends often boast higher yields but may lack consistent dividend policies. Regardless of market conditions, dividend stocks can be a useful tool for enhancing income and boosting portfolio growth potential. For instance, investors who are years away from retirement often reinvest their dividends to increase returns. According to an estimate by Charles Schwab, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in a broader market at the end of 1993 would have grown to over $182,000 by the end of 2023 if dividends were reinvested, compared to only $102,000 if they had not been reinvested. Also read: 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024 This means that investors looking to reduce their risk while still maintaining growth potential may want to consider high-quality dividend-paying companies. This approach is favored by Ramona Persaud, manager of Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund. She tends to focus on shares of high-quality firms that offer attractive valuations and strong dividends. Persaud pointed out that falling interest rates can create a favorable environment for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also mentioned that lower interest rates may lead to gains across a wider range of stocks, a shift from the past two years when market gains were largely driven by a few large-cap growth stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "I'm excited that really good companies may get more credit from investors than they have during the wave of glamour stocks. And investors stand to gain from the stocks' dividend payments." Persaud prioritizes stocks with strong balance sheets, high potential returns on investment, and predictable cash flows. Additionally, she seeks out stocks with attractive dividend yields relative to similar companies and the broader market. Monthly dividend stocks also focus on high dividend yields, which can be a key draw. While high yields may sometimes indicate the possibility of dividend cuts or weaker balance sheets, many monthly dividend companies have been increasing their payouts for years and also maintain solid financial health. However, investors should exercise caution when investing in these stocks. High dividend yields are not inherently negative. Stocks with high yields can still uphold strong dividend policies if their business fundamentals are solid. Many companies with above-average yields have consistently paid and even increased their dividends over time. Research indicated that, in the long run, these stocks often provide superior returns. For instance, a University of Nevada study found that portfolios consisting of the top 10 highest dividend yield stocks from the Dow 30 index outperformed those with medium and low dividend yields between 1987 and 2012. The study also highlighted that investing in high dividend yield stocks can be profitable over the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations in returns. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a list of companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders. Among these, we specifically chose businesses with robust dividend practices, consistently maintaining their payouts across multiple years. The majority of these selected companies operate within the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, as they are required to allocate 90% of their income towards dividends. From that list, we picked 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A modern REIT building with a bright and inviting entrance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) leases its properties to various entertainment and educational businesses, including amusement parks, movie theaters, and ski resorts, across the US and Canada. As a triple net lease REIT, the company requires its tenants to cover all real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. It owns 352 properties and leases to over 200 tenants in 44 US states and Canada. In the past 12 months, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) has declined by over 10.4%. The company's reliance on the shrinking movie theater market is a significant concern. In 2023, only 852 million movie tickets were sold in the US, a sharp decline from 1.85 billion tickets in 2002, and this downward trend may persist. The rise of streaming platforms, affordable large-screen TVs, and increasing ticket prices have led more people to watch movies at home. Despite these challenges, the company achieved a 99% occupancy rate by the end of Q3 2024. It managed this by selling off vacant theaters, attracting more non-theater tenants for experiential businesses, and expanding its education-related property portfolio. During the quarter, EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) finalized the sale of two theater properties and one early childhood education center, generating net proceeds of $8.7 million. The company's cash position remained strong. It ended the quarter with over $35.3 million of cash on hand with total assets amounting to nearly $5.7 billion. EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), one of the best dividend stocks, started paying quarterly dividends to shareholders since its IPO in 1997. The company shifted to monthly payments in 2013 and has paid regular dividends to shareholders since then. Its monthly dividend comes in at $0.285 per share for a dividend yield of 7.79%, as of December 28. As of the close of Q3 2023, 23 hedge funds held stakes in EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR), according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes are worth $247.4 million in total. Overall EPR ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks that pay monthly dividends in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of EPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Is Phillips Edison & Company, Inc. (PECO) Among the Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Phillips Edison & Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:PECO) stands against the other stocks that pay monthly dividends. Dividend stocks have long been a favorite among investors, regardless of the payout frequency. Companies, however, are deliberate in determining how often to reward their shareholders. Annual and semi-annual dividends might provide larger payouts, but their unpredictability can be challenging for investors. While major firms opt for quarterly payouts due to practicality, some choose monthly distributions, which many investors find attractive for the steady stream of passive income. In addition, a reduction in monthly payouts would have a smaller immediate impact, and receiving dividends monthly is one of the closest alternatives to a regular paycheck, simplifying the management of day-to-day finances. That said, history suggests that companies offering monthly dividends often boast higher yields but may lack consistent dividend policies. Regardless of market conditions, dividend stocks can be a useful tool for enhancing income and boosting portfolio growth potential. For instance, investors who are years away from retirement often reinvest their dividends to increase returns. According to an estimate by Charles Schwab, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in a broader market at the end of 1993 would have grown to over $182,000 by the end of 2023 if dividends were reinvested, compared to only $102,000 if they had not been reinvested. Also read: 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024 This means that investors looking to reduce their risk while still maintaining growth potential may want to consider high-quality dividend-paying companies. This approach is favored by Ramona Persaud, manager of Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund. She tends to focus on shares of high-quality firms that offer attractive valuations and strong dividends. Persaud pointed out that falling interest rates can create a favorable environment for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also mentioned that lower interest rates may lead to gains across a wider range of stocks, a shift from the past two years when market gains were largely driven by a few large-cap growth stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "I'm excited that really good companies may get more credit from investors than they have during the wave of glamour stocks. And investors stand to gain from the stocks' dividend payments." Persaud prioritizes stocks with strong balance sheets, high potential returns on investment, and predictable cash flows. Additionally, she seeks out stocks with attractive dividend yields relative to similar companies and the broader market. Monthly dividend stocks also focus on high dividend yields, which can be a key draw. While high yields may sometimes indicate the possibility of dividend cuts or weaker balance sheets, many monthly dividend companies have been increasing their payouts for years and also maintain solid financial health. However, investors should exercise caution when investing in these stocks. High dividend yields are not inherently negative. Stocks with high yields can still uphold strong dividend policies if their business fundamentals are solid. Many companies with above-average yields have consistently paid and even increased their dividends over time. Research indicated that, in the long run, these stocks often provide superior returns. For instance, a University of Nevada study found that portfolios consisting of the top 10 highest dividend yield stocks from the Dow 30 index outperformed those with medium and low dividend yields between 1987 and 2012. The study also highlighted that investing in high dividend yield stocks can be profitable over the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations in returns. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a list of companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders. Among these, we specifically chose businesses with robust dividend practices, consistently maintaining their payouts across multiple years. The majority of these selected companies operate within the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, as they are required to allocate 90% of their income towards dividends. From that list, we picked 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Investing.com's stocks of the year

Investing.com -- 2024 has been a year of significant market shifts, with some companies soaring to new heights while others faced significant headwinds. Investing.com has compiled a list of some of the year's most notable performers: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares struggled for the first part of the year, but that changed in November after the U.S. election, with Elon Musk having aligned himself with President-elect Donald Trump. Musk’s support on the campaign trail and his appointment, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy in heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency has helped to boost Tesla's stock as investors look at it as a "Trump trade". In a recent note, analysts at Baird raised their target for Tesla to $480 from $280, based on strong growth prospects in the automaker, supported by cost reductions, new models, and favorable regulatory dynamics. “The stock has gained significant momentum and has several upcoming potential catalysts. We like the stock long term and would be buyers on pullbacks,” the firm said. A potential regulatory fast track for the Cybercab, the rollout of affordable vehicles, and Musk's ties to President-elect Trump has Baird bullish on Tesla’s outlook for 2025. With Bitcoin also surging following the presidential election as investors expect a favorable environment for the sector, cryptocurrency-focused stocks have also rallied. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) started its rally ahead of the election and is up nearly 400% (as of December 27) this year. The stock, seen as a bellwether for Bitcoin exposure, was driven by surging Bitcoin prices and the company’s continued commitment to its cryptocurrency holdings. Meanwhile, Coinbase (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:HOOD) also benefitted from the crypto resurgence, up over 58% and 216% this year, respectively. The sector’s stellar performance in recent months reflects a growing belief in the crypto market as Trump prepares to take office in January. Since August, Palantir has skyrocketed and is also up close to 400% this year, solidifying its place as one of the top performers. The company’s software solutions and growing adoption across government and private sectors have made it a standout in the data analytics space. Wedbush analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and $75 target for the company’s shares in a note, stating: “With AI spending expected to ramp significantly within IT budgets in 2025, we believe the Messi of AI Palantir is in a prime spot to continue expanding its pipeline/deal flow.” They added: “We believe Palantir has a credible path to morph into the next Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) over the coming decade with AIP leading the way as many on the Street continue to be huge skeptics of the Messi of AI." While the stocks above primarily rallied towards the end of the year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made significant gains between January and June. After a pullback, it moved higher once again between August and November and is up over 175% this year. Nvidia has continued to capitalize on the demand stemming from AI. The company’s strategic positioning at the forefront of the AI revolution made it an essential stock for growth-focused investors. Truist analysts said they are “incrementally constructive” on Nvidia’s AI dominance, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock and raising the price target to $204 from $169 in a note. The firm noted that the stock has “been a home-run investment over the last two years owing to a new wave of AI demand,” and they expect 2025 to be “another constructive year.” They state that “all relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” while they believe “NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM.” In contrast to the names above, Intel has seen its stock plummet by 60% year-to-date. Challenges surrounding the company’s health and outlook have weighed heavily on its performance. Intel has struggled to maintain its leadership in the global chip market, ceding ground to rivals like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia. The abrupt removal of CEO Pat Gelsinger marked a dramatic turn, casting further doubt on the chipmaker’s ambitious turnaround plans. In a research note, Wolfe Research told investors that the biggest issue facing INTC is that “they simply don’t have the scale to be an IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturer] any longer, and the possibility of getting help from TSMC is going to be very difficult." Earlier this month, it was reported that two Intel executives said a manufacturing spinoff is possible if a new chipmaking technology slated for next year does not succeed.

Title: Is Pearson plc (PSO) Among the U.K. Dividend Aristocrats for 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Aristocrats List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) stands against the other U.K. dividend aristocrats. In recent years, investors have turned away from UK equities, opting instead for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies. The UK stock market is contracting at its fastest rate in over a decade, driven by takeovers of London-listed companies. According to Bloomberg data, approximately 45 companies have been delisted from the London market this year due to mergers and acquisitions, representing a 10% increase compared to the total for last year. This marks the highest number of delistings since 2010. Meanwhile, the value of deals targeting UK companies has surged by 81% this year, exceeding $160 billion. Earlier this year, UK equities seemed to be experiencing a shift in sentiment among both large institutions and smaller investors. The British stock market continues to attract bargain hunters, as UK equities are now trading at a record discount of over 40% compared to global counterparts, based on Bloomberg data. Many of the takeover targets have been mid-cap companies listed on London’s AIM market, which typically feature low trading volumes and limited analyst attention. That said, in November, investors returned to UK equity funds after three and a half years of consistent monthly withdrawals and a significant sell-off ahead of the Budget. Data from Calastone shows that retail investors directed a net £317 million into funds focused on UK stocks during the month. This inflow marks a notable shift, ending 41 consecutive months of net outflows, during which over £25 billion was withdrawn since May 2021. Also read: 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds The change in investor sentiment follows a challenging October for equity funds, which experienced record outflows as UK investors withdrew their money due to fears that the chancellor would raise capital gains tax (CGT). At the end of October, during the Budget announcement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed an immediate CGT increase. The lower rate rose from 10% to 18%, while the higher rate climbed from 20% to 24%. Analysts suggest the UK stock market could be nearing a recovery, but the timing and pace of this turnaround remain uncertain. This is where dividend stocks play a key role. Prioritizing stocks with rising dividends can offer stability and consistency through different market cycles. In addition, they provide an opportunity for long-term growth, compounding returns over time until share prices rebound. The UK market offers one of the highest dividend yields among major markets. The FTSE 100 boasts a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK companies, offers slightly lower yields but still provides attractive income opportunities. This allows investors to focus on higher-growth areas, such as smaller companies, while benefiting from increasing dividends. According to a report by BlackRock, currently, UK market dividends are growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Stocks with growing dividends typically have reliable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson's 2023 annual dividend report confirmed the rise in dividend growth, noting that the UK distributed approximately $86 billion in dividends in 2023, a notable increase from the $63.1 billion paid out in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks according to yield. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned over 40 holdings of the UK Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which tracks the performance of the highest-yielding UK companies with at least 7 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 28 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Dividend Yield as of December 28: 2.01% Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is a London-based multinational education company that focuses on a wide range of educational publishing and services. The stock has surged by over 132% since March 2020 as the publisher successfully adjusted to the changing online education landscape. The company took advantage of the pandemic, earning substantial profits from its virtual schooling services. It saw a 43% increase in enrollments in its virtual schools during the 2020-2021 academic year. However, in fiscal 2023, the company experienced a 20% drop in Virtual Learning sales due to reduced enrollments. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is generating strong earnings this year, delivering over 33% returns to shareholders since the start of 2024. In the first half of the year, the company reported revenue of £1.7 billion ($1.25 billion), down from £1.9 billion ($2.39 billion) in the same period last year. After 2025, the company is set to achieve a mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in underlying sales, along with continued margin improvements. This will result in an average annual increase of 40 basis points, driven by strong performance in its core business, realizing synergies, and expanding into related markets. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO)'s cash position came in strong in the first half of 2024. The company generated an operating cash flow of £185 million, up from £106 million in the prior year period. Its free cash flow showed an increase of £77 million at £27 million. This strong cash position has allowed the company to maintain its dividend payments for 33 years in a row. Currently, it offers an interim dividend of £0.074 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.01%, as of December 28. At the end of Q3 2023, 10 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO), compared with 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of nearly $33 million. Among these hedge funds, Arrowstreet Capital was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall PSO ranks 10th on our list of the U.K. dividend aristocrats.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) stands against the other new stocks. US public markets continue to brace themselves for a 2025 resurgence, which should be led by interest rate cuts, pent-up investor demand, and a growing backlog of IPO expectations. As per PwC, there are over 700 unicorns in the private market as a result of the subdued IPO activity over the previous 3 years. Many IPO candidates, which also include some unicorns, have utilized this time to improve and strengthen their finances and transition to sustainable growth models. Apart from this, pressure continues to mount on private equity fund managers to return capital after an elongated exit dry spell, reported PwC. As per PwC, the traditional IPO market saw its gradual comeback in 2024, with proceeds garnered ~50% higher than in 2023 and ~4x the amount raised in 2022. The IPO activity was broad-based, with strong participation from sectors such as technology, life sciences, consumer markets, and financial services. Stock prices of this year’s traditional IPOs appreciated ~29%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s return of ~27% on a YTD basis (ended 26th December 2024). This highlights the strength, investor interest, and traction in new offerings. PwC went on to add that IPO activity saw a strong increase in 2024, with 61 traditional IPOs garnering more than $26.4 billion YTD, which was in line with the combined total number of IPOs in 2022 and 2023, which witnessed 28 and 35 IPOs, respectively. Despite this improvement, IPO activity remained short of early anticipations and historical levels of activity. This is because several IPO candidates decided to stay on the sidelines as they waited for a clearer economic picture after the U.S. presidential elections.

The continued rate cuts and a stable policy environment should boost investor confidence, which can help create more favorable market conditions. PwC gave a 60% probability of a “soft landing” scenario and a 20% probability of an optimistic “no landing.” Notably, both of these scenarios offer a supportive environment for IPOs. As per Lynn Martin, president of the NYSE, 2025 year will be an active one for the IPOs. Also, Reuters highlighted that reduced interest rates and inflation slowdown should act as catalysts for new listings. Furthermore, the expected easing of regulations under the new Administration paints a positive picture of the deal activity in capital markets. Bloomberg reported that, as per Goldman Sachs, the number of IPOs in the tech sector is expected to more than double next year. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener to shortlist the companies that went public in the past 2 years. Next, we narrowed the list to the ones having high hedge fund positioning. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) provides water analytics, water treatment, marking and coding, and packaging and color services. The company began trading as a publicly traded company on 2nd October 2023. Jefferies believes in Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s long-term growth potential, which should stem from its focus on mission-critical applications, consistent pricing power, and a strong direct-to-customer distribution channel. With the company’s recurring sales accounting for ~61% of total sales during the nine-month period that ended September 27, 2024, Wall Street believes that this provides some sort of stability of revenues. As per Jefferies, an acceleration in growth is expected in 2025, fueled by a recovery in consumer-packaged goods (CPG) and industrial markets. With industries seeking to reduce their water footprint and operating costs, there seems to be growing interest in closed-loop water systems and process water recycling. Therefore, Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s capabilities in these areas should drive significant growth. As consumer demand stabilizes and increases, Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) will witness improved volumes in its Materials & Chemicals (M&C) and Products & Consumables (P&C) subsegments. Jefferies believes that Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO)’s combination of mid-single-digit (MSD) organic growth and healthy potential for strategic capital deployment places it well to compound its earnings at a double-digit rate. While Jefferies is bullish on Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO), Aristotle Capital Management, LLC recently sold its position because the firm believes that its other holdings within the water value chain are more optimal investments. Here is what the fund said: “In the fourth quarter of 2023, we received shares of the water and product quality company Veralto Corporation (NYSE:VLTO) when Danaher, a current Value Equity holding, spun off the business. After further assessing the now independently operated Veralto, we decided to exit our position. We believe our other holdings within the water value chain, including Xylem, American Water Works (our most recent purchase) and to some extent Ecolab, are more optimal investments.” Overall VLTO ranks 5th on our list of the best new stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VLTO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than VLTO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British semiconductor and software design company. It was listed on NASDAQ on 14th September 2023. Wall Street believes that Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s latest v9 chip architecture continues to gain traction. This transition is significant because v9-based chips command increased royalty rates, potentially doubling or even quadrupling the fees the company receives per chip. The transition should act as a revenue driver as it affects Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s core mobile market, where it has a strong market position. As and when smartphone manufacturers upgrade their devices to incorporate v9-based processors, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) will benefit from increased royalty rates on a massive installed base. Furthermore, the enhanced capabilities of v9 architecture, which includes improved AI performance and security features, can ramp up adoption in other markets like automotive and IoT, further driving royalty growth. The compounding effect of increased royalty rates and expanding market applications should support topline and bottom-line growth. Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s energy-efficient chip designs are well-suited for an increased demand for on-device AI processing in smartphones, PCs, and other edge devices. The on-device AI market size was valued at US$17 billion in 2023 and should reach US$114.36 billion by 2031, as per Verified Market Research. Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is well-positioned to capture a substantial portion of this expanding market. Overall ARM ranks 7th on our list of the best new stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK) stands against the other new stocks. US public markets continue to brace themselves for a 2025 resurgence, which should be led by interest rate cuts, pent-up investor demand, and a growing backlog of IPO expectations. As per PwC, there are over 700 unicorns in the private market as a result of the subdued IPO activity over the previous 3 years. Many IPO candidates, which also include some unicorns, have utilized this time to improve and strengthen their finances and transition to sustainable growth models. Apart from this, pressure continues to mount on private equity fund managers to return capital after an elongated exit dry spell, reported PwC. As per PwC, the traditional IPO market saw its gradual comeback in 2024, with proceeds garnered ~50% higher than in 2023 and ~4x the amount raised in 2022. The IPO activity was broad-based, with strong participation from sectors such as technology, life sciences, consumer markets, and financial services. Stock prices of this year’s traditional IPOs appreciated ~29%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s return of ~27% on a YTD basis (ended 26th December 2024). This highlights the strength, investor interest, and traction in new offerings. PwC went on to add that IPO activity saw a strong increase in 2024, with 61 traditional IPOs garnering more than $26.4 billion YTD, which was in line with the combined total number of IPOs in 2022 and 2023, which witnessed 28 and 35 IPOs, respectively. Despite this improvement, IPO activity remained short of early anticipations and historical levels of activity. This is because several IPO candidates decided to stay on the sidelines as they waited for a clearer economic picture after the U.S. presidential elections.

The continued rate cuts and a stable policy environment should boost investor confidence, which can help create more favorable market conditions. PwC gave a 60% probability of a “soft landing” scenario and a 20% probability of an optimistic “no landing.” Notably, both of these scenarios offer a supportive environment for IPOs. As per Lynn Martin, president of the NYSE, 2025 year will be an active one for the IPOs. Also, Reuters highlighted that reduced interest rates and inflation slowdown should act as catalysts for new listings. Furthermore, the expected easing of regulations under the new Administration paints a positive picture of the deal activity in capital markets. Bloomberg reported that, as per Goldman Sachs, the number of IPOs in the tech sector is expected to more than double next year. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best New Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener to shortlist the companies that went public in the past 2 years. Next, we narrowed the list to the ones having high hedge fund positioning. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:RBRK), which went public on 25th April 2024, provides data security solutions to individuals and businesses. Wall Street believes that Rubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK) is well-positioned to continue to take share from legacy data backup providers.

The company can leverage its healthy reputation and innovative products to tap a larger share of the growing cyber resilience market. With continuous enhancements in security capabilities, the company can drive adoption and expand its customer base. Unlike legacy vendors, Rubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK)’s architecture primarily focuses on recovery over prevention, leveraging air-gapped systems that tend to isolate threats and minimize downtime, payroll disruptions, and legal costs during breaches. The company’s innovative approach and partnerships with cybersecurity giants such as Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler further strengthened its reputation. Rubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK)’s platform is designed for the cloud era, providing seamless integration with public and private cloud environments. This flexibility enables organizations to manage and protect data throughout diverse infrastructures, a capability that legacy backup solutions often lack. ClearBridge Investments sees a material upside to Rubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK)’s stock on the back of its cloud-based offerings and its plans to take share from legacy data backup providers. Here's what the firm said in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “The IPO and capital markets have begun to rebound, albeit slowly, providing new investment opportunities and idea generation. In fact, this quarter saw our first IPO participation since the capital markets fervor of 2021 with data security provider Rubrik, Inc. (NYSE:RBRK). Rubrik, meanwhile, is a next-generation data storage, backup and recovery provider showing strong, double-digit subscription revenue growth. We believe its cloud-based offerings have resonated with its Fortune 500 customer base, positioning it well to continue to take share from legacy data backup providers. The introduction of new AI data security products could offer an additional revenue source to Rubrik’s business.” Overall RBRK ranks 12th on our list of the best new stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of RBRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: This year in crypto – Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF approvals, ‘Trump pump,’ etc.

The year’s biggest development by far was the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The past year has been highly eventful. From Bitcoin’s [BTC] halving to the Ethereum [ETH] Spot ETF approval, from the quantum computing threat to Bitcoin briefly seizing headlines, here are some of the year’s big highlights. The biggest development by far was the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval. This came after some false alarms caused massive BTC price volatility, such as the one from Cointelegraph in October 2023. On 10 January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange traded products, or ETFs. Crypto Twitter went haywire, and investors were delirious at the idea of BTC being open to millions of mainstream investors. The emergence of BlackRock and Fidelity as two of the largest ETF funds was also a major boost to sentiment. They currently hold 550k and 200k BTC, respectively. From being a niche asset class, BTC is now open to the public. The funds are regulated and managed by some of the largest entities in the financial world. Michael Saylor, Co-founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy, has also been relentlessly buying Bitcoin. Other companies are beginning to stack BTC too. Source: Michael Saylor on X The Ethereum Spot ETF approval was also a boost to the industry. The 2024 presidential campaign spurred many debates about either candidate and the kind of administration they would bring. Trump’s embrace of crypto, his appearances at industry events, and his campaign promises made his administration’s pro-crypto position clear. This boosted crypto sentiment massively. In fact, the President-elect even made promises to make the USA the crypto-capital of the world. Policy reformations would probably be introduced to bring regulatory clarity. Trump also made public the intention to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a known crypto critic with a tendency to be aggressive in his oversight of crypto. Gensler would be stepping down on 20 January, Trump’s inauguration date. Whether he follows through on those promises remains to be seen. Election time saw the cryptocurrency-based prediction market Polymarket gain popularity. It allows users to gain or lose from the outcome of world events. During these elections, it massively favored Trump to be the victor, which turned out to be accurate. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025-26 In late September, Trump and his three sons announced World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) money market platform. Enthusiasts see this as a positive development, while critics brought the obvious conflict of interest to attention. WLF’s purchase of crypto tokens such as Chainlink [LINK] and Aave [AAVE] were transparent due to the nature of the blockchain, boosting these tokens’ prices. Source: DeFiLlama The DeFi ecosystem in general has also been thriving. The DeFi revival is apparent from the rising total value locked (TVL) across different chains. It was at $120 billion, at press time, closing in on the $170 billion high it made in late 2021 during the last cycle. Finally, Uniswap [UNI], the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, set records in November. Its monthly trading volume for a Layer-2 solution hit $38 billion, surpassing the $34 billion high it set in March 2024.

Title: Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW): Among the Cheap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading Into 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Cheap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) stands against the other cheap healthcare stocks. Investing in healthcare equities is typically seen as protective during recessionary times. This is because, even in hard financial times, consumers usually do not reduce their usage of prescription drugs or other necessary healthcare services. National healthcare spending is expected to reach an estimated $4.8 trillion in 2023 and increase at a 5.6% annual pace between 2027 and 2032, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). According to a World Health Organization report published in December 2023, worldwide healthcare spending reached a record high in 2021 at $9.8 trillion, or 10.3% of global GDP. Except in low-income countries, where government health spending declined as a result of their significant reliance on foreign aid, public health spending increased globally. While 11% of the world's population lived in countries where yearly healthcare spending was less than $50 per person, high-income countries paid about $4,000 per capita in 2021. Additionally, low-income countries accounted for just 0.24% of global health spending, despite having 8% of the world's population. The study claims that although public health spending rose dramatically during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, this increase is unlikely to last in the long term as countries now place a higher priority on economic problems such as high inflation, decreasing GDP, and mounting debt servicing. According to Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO Assistant Director-General for Universal Health Coverage, Life Course: “Sustained public financing on health is urgently needed to progress towards universal health coverage. It is especially critical at this time when the world is confronted by the climate crisis, conflicts, and other complex emergencies. People’s health and well-being need to be protected by resilient health systems that can also withstand these shocks.” The impending collapse of the U.S. healthcare system, especially in terms of staff shortages and financial instability, is the most worrisome aspect of the healthcare sector. There is a serious manpower shortage in the healthcare sector. An additional 124,000 doctors are expected to be required by 2030, and by 2027, 800,000 registered nurses (RNs) are expected to retire. A startling 24% of staff registered nurses are currently leaving their jobs. In certain healthcare systems, this deficit has resulted in the shutdown of critical patient services like obstetrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, and intensive care units. Nevertheless, the U.S. spends over twice as much on healthcare as the OECD average, despite these difficulties, and the average results are poorer. This discrepancy emphasizes how ineffective and unsustainable the current system is. Further taxing the revenue cycle and reducing the amount of money available for therapeutic treatments is the fact that 58% of hospital bad debt originates from insured patients. The future of the American healthcare system appears bleak when these elements are taken together. The industry faces a systemic collapse that could have serious repercussions for the economy and public health if substantial intervention and reform are not implemented. Our methodology involved selecting stocks with a market capitalization exceeding $10 billion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio below 17. We then ranked these stocks based on their P/E ratios, as of December 22. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A skilled surgeon surrounded by a team of medical professionals performing a Transcatheter Heart Valve Replacement. P/E Ratio: 10.73 Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) is a medical technology company specializing in devices for cardiovascular diseases, including structural heart disease and critical care. Its products include surgical and transcatheter heart valves (e.g., SAPIEN valves), hemodynamic and pressure monitoring devices, and vascular solutions like Fogarty catheters and carotid shunts. In Q3 2024, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) delivered strong financial performance, surpassing earnings expectations. Their revenue grew 9.6% on a constant currency basis to $1.35 billion which was driven by robust results in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT). The company reported an adjusted EPS of $0.67, slightly exceeding the projected $0.665, reflecting its ability to sustain profitability while investing in growth. The corporation's TAVR segment saw a 6% increase in global sales, reaching $1 billion, with the U.S. market performing consistently and Europe benefiting from the launch of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. Meanwhile, TMTT sales surged 74% year-over-year to $91 million which was driven by strong adoption of the PASCAL repair system and the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system. Full-year guidance for TMTT remains at the higher end of $320 million to $340 million. In the surgical segment, revenue rose 5% to $240 million which was supported by innovative technologies such as INSPIRIS, MITRIS, and KONECT. The company's strategic acquisitions, including JC Medical, JenaValve, and Endotronix, have expanded its presence in new therapeutic areas and bolstered its leadership in structural heart disease. Regulatory milestones, such as the CE mark approval for the Alterra system for congenital heart patients and U.S. approval of the 56mm EVOQUE valve, further enhance the company’s growth trajectory. As of Q3 2024, 55 hedge funds held shares in the company as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder was Fisher Asset Management with stakes worth $599 million. Overall EW ranks 2nd on our list of the cheap healthcare stocks to buy heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of EW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A row of shelves in a retail pharmacy, demonstrating the variety of drugs and over-the-counter products. P/E Ratio: 11.78 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), standing fourth among the cheap healthcare stocks to buy heading into 2025, is a leading U.S. healthcare company with a multifaceted business model. It operates over 9,900 retail pharmacies offering medications, health products, and household items. The company provides pharmacy services, including prescription filling, specialty and mail-order services, and Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) through Caremark. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) also offers health services via MinuteClinic for walk-in care and HealthHUB locations for chronic disease management and telehealth. Additionally, through its acquisition of Aetna, the corporation provides medical, dental, and vision insurance, enabling comprehensive healthcare solutions. Customers' access to services has been improved by CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) by utilizing its knowledge of health. Aetna, the company's insurance division, unveiled SimplePay Health on October 16. The new service is an alternate health plan designed to accommodate self-insured consumers' various needs. The strategy improves health outcomes while saving customers money. On October 1, Aetna revealed its 2025 Medicare plans to meet its objectives. By guaranteeing that people have access to dependable and reasonably priced healthcare when needed, the plan aims to address the members' most pressing health requirements. 59 million Medicare-eligible beneficiaries will have access to Aetna's Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans when they extend to 44 states and Washington, DC, in 2025, for a total of 2,259 counties. In addition, Medicare Advantage (MA) by Aetna will offer a $0 monthly fee to 83% of Medicare-eligible enrollees in the United States. In its Q2 2024 investor letter, Ariel Investments' Ariel Global Fund made the following statement about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS): “American healthcare company, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), also declined following disappointing earnings results and a subsequent reduction in full-year guidance. The miss was primarily due to increased utilization of Medicare Advantage plans and weakness in the health services segment driven by the loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. In response, management reiterated its focus on improving margins and enhancing its positioning in Medicare Advantage. CVS believes the program can remain an attractive business for Aetna and CVS Health over time and will construct its bid for 2025 as a multi-year repricing opportunity across plan-level benefits. Meanwhile, CVS continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and a recent accelerated share repurchase transaction.” Overall CVS ranks 4th on our list of the cheap healthcare stocks to buy heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of CVS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stands against the other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared some investment guidelines based on his 40 years of experience. As we previously discussed in our article, Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks, Cramer emphasized that both bulls and bears can profit, but greed leads to losses, advising investors to take profits and avoid being overly greedy. His second rule is that paying taxes is acceptable. Finally, Cramer stressed the importance of not making large, all-at-once buys or sales, recommending gradual adjustments to positions instead. In addition to these guidelines, Cramer’s next rule was to recognize the importance of distinguishing between damaged stocks and damaged companies. He explained that buying stocks from companies that are fundamentally flawed is a mistake with no chance of recovery, but stocks of companies that are simply experiencing temporary issues may present a buying opportunity. This distinction is critical because, as Cramer pointed out, there’s no “money-back guarantee” when buying into a company with long-term problems. Investors should focus on finding stocks that are down for reasons that aren’t related to poor company fundamentals. Cramer then moved on to his next rule, which is to always do the relevant homework. “If you want to build a portfolio of individual stocks, that's a big if since there's nothing wrong with getting all of your equity exposure from a cheap index fund that mirrors the S&P 500, well, you gotta be rigorous about it. Which brings me to my next rule: Do the homework.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 8 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Restaurants and Retail Stocks Cramer said that doing the homework means more than just picking stocks based on a gut feeling; it involves actively researching companies by listening to earnings calls, reading research reports, and staying on top of the news. Cramer noted that some investors dismiss this kind of work, seeing it as unnecessary or outdated in today’s fast-paced world. However, he was clear in his belief that failing to do proper research before buying stocks is foolish and can lead to poor investment choices. Cramer further emphasized that doing homework today is easier than ever. With so much information available on the internet, there's no excuse for not gathering as much data as possible. For those who don’t have the time or inclination to dive deep into individual stocks, Cramer suggested that index funds are a great alternative. Another crucial rule that Cramer continually stresses is the importance of diversification. “The next rule is another essential that I harp on constantly: Diversify, diversify, and diversify. Always be diversified, that controls risk, and managing risk is really the holy grail of this business. What's the biggest risk out there? It's called sector risk.” Sector risk refers to the potential for a specific sector of the economy to lag, which can result in negative impacts on investments within that sector. Cramer explained that sector risk is one of the most significant dangers to an investment portfolio, and diversification is the only way to protect against it. He frequently says that "diversification is the only free lunch in this business" because it’s the one investment principle that benefits everyone. As per Cramer, by mixing different sectors in a portfolio, at least five according to him, investors can prevent themselves from suffering catastrophic losses if one particular sector takes a hit. “Here's the bottom line: Whether you're an amateur or professional, you always need to do your homework and keep your portfolio diversified. This is the kind of routine maintenance that protects you from monster losses down the line. Remember, if you can keep your losses to a minimum and let your gains run, you almost always come out ahead. But don't try to rationalize those losses because stocks don't always come back to even or anywhere near that.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A workstation in a research lab stocked with laboratory products and services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98 Talking about life sciences equipment and solutions provider, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Cramer said: "They make big ticket equipment that these companies need to conduct research, but most of the revenues come from consumables and services for these customers. Regular viewers know that I liked Thermo Fisher for a very long time. It's been a fabulous performer over the last decade, but it’s struggled ever since the stock peaked at the end of 2021, pulled back hard in 2022... Cramer noted that while the stock showed improvement in 2023, it fell sharply after a mixed earnings report in October, which included weaker-than-expected revenue and soft guidance for the fourth quarter. He said that the selling continued, exacerbated by a broader healthcare sector decline. However, the one thing that halted the decline was when the company announced a $4 billion buyback program in mid-November, and in early December, revealed that it had already bought back $1 billion of stock. “I think things will gradually improve for Thermo Fisher with business picking up in 2025 and 2026 and hey, if the IPO market ever comes back to life, there'll be a new wave of biotech companies coming public and spending their money on life science equipment. Doesn't hurt that Thermo Fisher now only trades at 22 times next year's estimate. That's very low because this is a 30 multiple stock over many years.” For the third quarter, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) reported adjusted EPS of $5.28, a decrease from $5.69 in the same period last year, though slightly exceeding expectations. Revenue increased marginally to $10.60 billion, falling short of consensus estimates. The company raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $21.35 to $22.07, up from its previous forecast of $21.29 to $22.07. It also confirmed its revenue guidance of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion. Overall TMO ranks 1st on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A factory worker monitoring a conveyor belt of specialty chemicals being produced. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer expressed hesitation about chemical companies like LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) having ‘similarly high yields” and remarked: “Okay, I can't say it's necessarily safe that all the chemical companies have similarly high yields. A lot of them are related to China and China weakness. And I think each one has to be explored on its own and that… if this cycle stays bad and the Fed doesn't cut rates quickly enough, a lot of these companies may end up to be, let's say dicier than you'd like to be. How about that? I wanna be polite about it.” LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) is a prominent global player in the production of petrochemicals, polymers, and fuels, serving a broad range of industries. The stock has a yield of 7.18% at the time of writing on December 27, which is up from the 5.62% yield it had when Cramer last talked about it in October. As discussed in our article, Jim Cramer’s Exclusive List of 9 YEV Stocks, at the time, Cramer noted that the stock, like others in its industry, follows a cyclical pattern, performing well during strong economic periods but struggling during downturns. This cyclical nature explains why the stock has lagged this year due to broader economic challenges. He commented: “Until very recently, the two largest economies of the world, the United States and China were both deteriorating. But think about what’s happened just in the past few weeks. First, the Fed officially kicked off a new easing cycle, starting with that double rate cut I just mentioned. And then there’s a clear consensus that we are going to get several more rate cuts done before the Fed is finished… LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations over the past year, with a 77% conversion rate of EBITDA into cash, close to its 80% target. Despite facing challenging market conditions that impacted its third-quarter cash generation, the company expects an improvement in the fourth quarter due to lower global interest rates and economic stimulus measures in China. Additionally, the company is focusing on profitability through its value enhancement program, expecting to unlock $600 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year and $400 million in 2024. Overall LYB ranks 4th on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of LYB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Disney’s Biggest Disasters of 2024: From 'The Acolyte' to 'Mufasa' to ABC News
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/12/28/disneys-biggest-disasters-of-2024-from-the-acolyte-to-mufasa-to-abc-news/

The Walt Disney Company saw its fair share of disasters in 2024, even as Hollywood’s biggest studio continued to wield enormous power across media and politics. Disney repeatedly attacked now-President-elect Donald Trump throughout the campaign cycle, resulting in a bad year for ABC News. The studio saw its biggest streaming show of the year flop with subscribers, yet another ominous sign for the Disney+ service. And Disney closed out the year with a major box-office bomb. For CEO Bob Iger, 2024 was something of a transition period as the company continued in recovery mode following two financially difficult years. Iger swung the ax yet again across multiple Disney properties, with layoffs at Pixar, ABC News, NatGeo, and more. Last year, Iger laid off 7,000 workers worldwide, or three percent of its workforce, as the company’s financials tanked. Disney can take solace in the success of its blockbuster sequels — Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine were the two top-grossing movies of the year. But for every Moana 2 that rakes in a fortune, Disney also lays a giant egg, further sullying the studio’s formerly sterling reputation. Here are Disney’s biggest disasters for 2024. The Acolyte With a budget that one estimate put at close to a quarter of a billion dollars, Disney’s latest Star Wars spin-off series aimed to be a streaming blockbuster that would help drive subscriptions. Instead, the series tanked with viewers and was canceled after just one season. Who’s to blame? Most critics pointed to its weak and pointless story, unengaging main actress Amandla Stenberg pointlessly playing two twins, and pointless virtue signaling (a coven of lesbian witches saying they are not welcome in the galaxy, the casting of a transgender actor in a supporting role, and showrunner Leslye Headland herself, who promoted the series as the “gayest Star Wars” ever). Disney+ Woes The Acolyte‘s failure is emblematic of the entire streaming service Disney+, whose original and exclusive content has not resulted in the market dominance Iger had hoped for. As the year drew to a close, headline after headline signaled trouble for the content platform. In September, Disney slashed prices for new subscribers to $1.99 a month, hoping to boost its Q4 numbers. This month, an ad industry expert reported that companies are pulling their dollars from Disney+ due to unimpressive subscriber numbers, and Disney was shut out on the streaming charts by Netflix, Amazon, Paramount+, and even Peacock. Mufasa: The Lion King In what was supposed to be a box-office slam dunk, this “live action” prequel to The Lion King opened to a hugely disappointing $35 million — way off from the already muted expectation of $50 million. The movie could still find its legs, but the opening was a catastrophe for Disney, which was hoping to turn The Lion King into its own movie franchise. ABC News The Disney-owned news network face-planted hard during the presidential campaign. First, debate anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis put their fingers on the scale in favor of Kamala Harris, resulting in a rigged match that was too obvious to ignore. Muir paid the price — his World News Tonight ratings tanked the week after the debate. Then, host George Stephanopoulos stepped in it when he defamed Trump on-air, resulting in a more than $15 million settlement. The Bob Iger wing of the Trump presidential library is going to look grand. Looking Ahead As 2025 approaches, Disney is readying to launch one of its biggest titles: Snow White, starring Rachel Zegler, opens in less than three months. In February, Pixar will release its first-ever TV series, Win or Lose. Both projects have made major changes to appeal more to non-woke audiences. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

In CY24, they have not been let down by any of them. All delivered positive returns in the calendar year, with equities topping the list. As far as the long-term performance is concerned, small- and mid-cap stocks top the chart in 2024 and outperformed the other asset classes. The accompanying chart exhibits the relative long-term performance of the most liquid financial asset classes accessible to Indian investors. We considered large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, gold, silver, US equities, Chinese equities, long-term debt and short-term debt and, computed the five-year returns at the end of each year for the last ten years. The assets were picked based on investment options available for Indian investors via direct investing or mutual funds/ETFs. Overall, when looking at long-term performance, mid-caps outperformed large-caps and small-caps in terms of consistency and relatively better returns. In the last five-year timeframe ended 2024, the Nifty Smallcap 250 Total Return Index (TRI), which represents small-cap stocks, produced a compound annualised return of 30.6 per cent, while the mid-caps as represented by Nifty Midcap 150 TRI, delivered a return of 28.3 per cent. The domestic equities market demonstrated stellar show after the pandemic, despite short-term turbulences. Trivesh D, COO Tradejini says, “However, this stellar performance may not carry forward into 2025. Market dynamics indicate that growth across segments is likely to moderate, with mid-single-digit returns being a realistic projection. Large caps may continue to provide stability but face valuation pressures, while mid and small caps could witness uneven performance due to slower earnings growth and heightened regulatory scrutiny”. Over the last 15 years, mid-caps have consistently outperformed large-caps and small-caps in the majority of timeframes, as the table illustrates. Over the last two years, US equities delivered better returns compared to the large-cap stocks in the domestic market. This growth has been largely driven by the ‘Magnificent 7 ’ — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — backed by strong earnings and major investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Further rupee depreciation has boosted 5 year returns for an Indian investor. For example, while the last 5-year CAGR of S&P 500 total returns (including dividends) is 15 per cent in USD terms, it increases to 19 per cent in INR terms. “In 2024, the US market has become much more balanced,” said Pratik Oswal, head of passive funds at Motilal Oswal AMC. The 450-490 companies that had not performed well last year have also recovered in 2024 and demonstrated better returns, he added. Macroeconomic factors such as the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate cut rate and the likelihood of more in the offing, and the easing of the rate of inflation have been favourable factors, leading to a resurgence in US stocks, Oswal said. After three years of underperformance, Chinese stocks came into the limelight thanks to the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government in October 2024. The policy measure announced were aimed at supporting a weak property sector, increase retail consumption and boost capital markets. A China-focussed ETF trading in India returned 29 per cent this year, although 5-year CAGR was flat. The years 2018–2022 were not so good for the domestic fixed income markets, due to multiple headwinds. However, things changed over the last 18-20 months due to few factors including significant FII (foreign institutional investors) inflows into Indian government bonds and expectations of a rate cut cycle. Devang Shah, Head Fixed Income, Axis Mutual Fund, said, “For 2025, we believe the RBI will cut rates, driving performance of bond markets. We expect a 50-basis points rate cut in the next six months. The reasons for this would be slower GDP growth, as seen in the lower Q2 GDP, with Q3 and Q4 also expected to be lower. This would prompt the RBI to change its course and start cutting rates”. Your asset allocation plan should include debt funds since they may act as a buffer when other asset classes decline. Gold, as an asset class, is used as a store of value and a hedge against stock market volatility amid economic uncertainties. Despite short-term blips, gold prices have been on the rise since October 2022. The yellow metal has delivered a solid CAGR of 14.4 per cent over the last five years in rupee terms. Expected rate cuts by major economies and persisting geopolitical tensions led to a significant surge in gold price. Chirag Mehta, CIO, Quantum AMC said, “The surge in gold prices is anticipated to persist into 2025, with the trajectory expected to be influenced significantly by the return of President Donald Trump to office, which could herald a series of policy changes and strategic decisions.” Expected rate cuts by major economies and persisting geopolitical tensions could also lead to a significant surge in gold price he added. While the gold has been the mainstay of investors’ portfolio for years for diversification into commodities, the silver has also gained traction among investors. Silver is a key component in solar panels and other renewable energy technologies. The increasing demand for these technologies has driven up the demand for silver. Manish Banthia, CIO Fixed Income, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The outlook for silver in 2025 is shaped by two key factors: its relationship with gold as a proxy in the precious metals space and its industrial demand dynamics”. The year 2025 presents a challenging macroeconomic environment in the United States, characterized by elevated debt levels and a substantial fiscal deficit. Gold, traditionally seen as a hedge against risk, is likely to benefit from these uncertainties, and this positive sentiment could extend to silver, given its dual role as a precious and industrial metal Banthia added. Secondly, the ongoing surge in power sector investments and electric vehicles (EVs) investments continues because of new age applications demand for silver may remain robust. Should these trends persist, silver’s industrial value will likely remain strong Banthia explained. Silver, in rupee term, delivered a CAGR return of 13.7 per cent in the last five years. However, gold outperformed silver over long run in most time frames, as the table illustrates. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This year was a mixed bag for the large automakers, with sales in the US climbing and prices holding steady for the most part. But changes are coming for the industry — whether on the domestic front with a new administration or the threat of cheaper, foreign competition. S&P Global Mobility projects US sales will hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.2 million units in 2025, an estimated increase of 1.2% from a projected 16.0 million units in 2024, which S&P says still reflects an uncertain environment for auto sales in the US. "Vehicle pricing levels are expected to decline but remain high; interest rates are expected to shift further downwards, but inflation levels are anticipated to remain sticky, and new vehicle inventory should also progress, but careful management is expected too,” said Chris Hopson, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, in its 2025 report. With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from major automakers in the US next year, starting with the big three.

The biggest of the Big Three experienced a strong 2024 with robust sales of its generally higher-priced vehicles, like trucks, SUVs, and EVs.

GM announced a $6 billion ASR in June of this year, following a $10 billion ASR in November of 2023. After a Q3 in which GM said it took market share, the rest of the year was set up for success. GM said its inventory stood at around 627,000 vehicles entering Q4, which is around 50 to 60 days of supply entering a typically busy holiday period, and incentives in Q3 were 4.5% of average transaction price, which the automaker said was 2% below the industry. New EVs are coming in 2025, with the Cadillac Vistiq, Optiq, Escalade IQ, and Chevrolet Bolt EV. This comes after the company refreshed the Chevy Equinox and Traverse, GMC Acadia and Terrain, and Buick Enclave. But GM might have some issues with its EVs if the tax credit goes away under the Trump administration. “If those EV models, specifically for GM, because they made some launches that are doing fairly well in the past three months — if they're not eligible for tax credits next year, it is going to impact their ability to scale and ultimately our growth assumption,” S&P Global autos sector lead Nishit Madlani told Yahoo Finance. Despite a strong year, the company had some late-year surprises, like a $5 billion write-down in China and a wind-down of its Cruise robotaxi business. Investors will be keeping an eye on those two stories as 2025 progresses. GM’s archrival, Ford, is coming off a good sales year too. But all has not been well for the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker. The company had to scale back its profit outlook for 2024 due to supplier issues and is still losing billions of dollars in its EV business. The company canceled an upcoming three-row EV SUV and pushed back the opening of a new EV plant, opting to focus instead on smaller EVs for the future, such as a compact-style pickup it says is coming next decade. With the cash cow F-150 pickup and Expedition full-size vehicles updated in 2024, Ford’s 2025 will consist of updates to the Mustang and Ford Transit commercial van along with the release of the $300,000 Mustang GTD supercar. The company has seen sales jump for its hybrid offerings like the Maverick pickup, F-150 hybrid PowerBoost models, and Escape CUV, and will continue to shift production toward those units. Wall Street is looking for better execution from Ford as well as cost discipline. “There are indications that the profit story for them is not trending in the direction we had expected a year ago, when we raised them to investment rate,” Madlani said. “They had some warranty costs. They had some supplier stability issues that we haven't seen at other automakers. So that's why there's some questions internally around execution from the management team there as well.” Ford will give a full update on its EV business outlook and profitability in the first half of 2025. The situation isn’t much better at Stellantis, which has Dodge, Ram, Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, and others in its portfolio. A management shake-up will bring a new CEO in 2025 and a revamped plan for its automobiles and trucks. The delayed EV push for the automaker will see changes as well, with gas-powered cars joining the ranks of EVs, which will share the same platform. This comes after sales slumped for the automaker, with inventory building up and dealers having to slash elevated prices to move vehicles off the lots. “We’re grinding through a transition,” CFO Doug Ostermann said following the release of disappointing Q3 sales. For 2025 the company has promised lower prices for its existing models, like Jeep SUVs, with the addition of engine choices like V6s and V8s for customers who did not want to see those powertrain choices go away. And new models are on the way too. In terms of new product launches, the all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona is coming with a gas-powered version as well, an all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S is on the roster, and the Ram 1500 Ramcharger range-extended hybrid pickup will be pushed forward to 2025, jumping ahead of the all-electric Ram REV EV pickup. It should be noted that the Ram trucks were supposed to arrive in 2024. While S&P’s Madlani notes Stellantis has seen some improvement in terms of inventory management, there are deeper issues to work through, such as its mismanagment of production and demand in the first place. S&P ratings has a negative outlook on Stellantis at the moment. The world’s largest automaker — and the Big Three's biggest competitor — is having a banner year in the US, with year-to-date sales through Q3 up 5.5% and its “electrified vehicle” sales up a whopping 58% year to date. Powering those electrified sales are its Camry hybrids, RAV4 hybrid crossover, and even the new Tacoma that comes in mild hybrid form. And, of course, the Prius — the hybrid king that came to US shores 20 years ago is still setting the pace for hybrid sales. This year, Toyota went all out in the US with an all-new Camry and Tacoma pickup, two of its major volume sellers. It also relaunched the Landcruiser SUV and brought out minor updates to the Corolla, Sienna, and Crown, to name a few. Coming in 2025 is the new 4Runner, a midsize go-anywhere SUV with a devoted following that will be coming with — you guessed it — a hybrid powertrain. Toyota says hybrids are what Americans want, and pickup and SUV offerings like the Tacoma and 4Runner will cater to that demand. One note of caution for Toyota is the coming merger of Honda and Nissan. While the situation won’t likely change much in the near term (with the deal looking to close in 2026), it will allow the two Japanese automakers to match Toyota in size. “There is potential for a merged company to be better prepared to address the competitive threat from the newer players, as well as to be more competitive with Toyota,” S&P Global Mobility analyst Stephanie Brinley said in a note published earlier this month. Germany’s Volkswagen (VWAGY), once the crown jewel of the country’s automotive sector and formerly the world’s No. 1 automaker, had a rough year. The company’s slump in important regions like Europe (with threats of a major labor strike averted for the time being) and China is a major problem, and development difficulties with its in-house software and EV development have led to costly delays. The situation in China, once a top region for the company, isn’t going to get better anytime soon, even with a new joint venture partner coming. However, the US region has actually improved, with sales growing for the Atlas SUV, Tiguan crossover, and even Jetta sedan. Meanwhile, the company’s sole EV offering — the ID.4 — has seen sales cut by half in Q3, and the ID.Buzz van just went on sale, with a costly starting price of about $60,000. Another concern: There are no hybrids on offer at the moment in the US, a big miss considering their popularity. VW says the upcoming all-new Tiguan in 2025 won’t have hybrid power until 2026 at the latest, which is a concern as it is VW’s top seller in the US. The full-size Atlas won’t get hybrid power until 2026, either. VW’s big bet on electrification remains with EVs at the moment, which could be a tough sell. With most of its current models updated or refreshed last year or this fall with the 2025 model year, VW does not at the moment have anything big planned for next year. In fact, VW’s biggest new push in the US is with Scout Motors, its wholly owned startup that will make EV and hybrid versions of SUV and pickup adventure vehicles using Rivian tech. But those vehicles won’t be in showrooms until 2027 at the earliest, which means VW will have to power through with its current portfolio through 2025 and beyond.

Title: bl.portfolio in 2024: Preferred prudence over popularity, rationalism over exuberance

It is no different for us at bl.portfolio. Here, we take this annual ritual very seriously as we are in the business of giving ideas for your hard-earned money. In the world of investing, no one can predict the markets with certainty but what we can do is prefer prudence over popularity and rationalism over exuberance. That has always been our credo and in the same spirit, we curated our product every week this year. Here is an honest report card of all we did 2024: Caution has been the watchword in our approach to and writings on the equity markets in 2024. On the back of the nearly 20 per cent rally in the markets in 2023, our equity outlook for 2024, published on January 7 , set the tone saying that while there was no case for pessimism, there was ample case for caution this year. Our stance emanated from the market valuation at the beginning of the year (23.8 times trailing) being above long-term averages as well as heightened optimism on earnings growth. In this firm belief, even as the markets raced to their all-time highs well into the year until end-September, we gave more hold/sell/book profit calls on stocks (44) as against buy/accumulate (31). Looking back, we stand vindicated, with the markets now 10 per cent below the September peak and India Inc faced with a consumption slowdown, a slow pick-up in private capex as well as a cooling off in earnings growth. In our assessment period for our stock calls (July 2023 to June 2024), we gave 117 calls across the primary (42) and secondary markets (75). About one-third of the sell /book profits/avoid calls have worked for us, prominent among them being the calls on telecom and IT players such as Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers, Tata Communications and Birlasoft. With Nifty IT up 23 per cent this year on the back of last year’s 22 per cent, book profit calls on stocks such as HCL Tech haven’t worked well. But we continue to remain watchful on IT stocks, as we believe the rally has been driven by valuation multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. Our book profits call on PSUs such as Power Grid and NHPC worked well too, but calls to take money out on IRFC, RVNL and Mazagon Dock, though backed by sound fundamental arguments, were given a bit early, in hindsight. These stocks have eventually seen corrections since the September market peak. Reiterating our cautious views on overvalued PSUs especially in the defence space, we highlighted the significant risks in holding on to these stocks, despite their growth potential. In our edition dated July 7 , we had noted why the stocks trading at obscene valuations would be unable to ‘avert a painful retreat when market cycle attacks with a vengeance.’ It was near-perfect timing given the significant fall in defence stocks since then. Our article on the underlying factors driving the PSU rally published on May 11, 2024, is one of the top-read articles this year from the bl.portfolio section on our website. That said, half of our well-researched ‘buys’ this year (six in 11 calls) have outperformed the bellwether and the broader markets. These include value-picks NCC, KNR Constructions and UTI AMC, international pick Alphabet as well as Godrej Agrovet and Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In-house expertise on international investing is our USP, but we do admit we have been very choosy this year due to our conservative stance. Apart from the call on Alphabet mentioned above, we recommended a partial book profit on Meta Platforms in February 2024. Investors would have made 5x returns from our earlier buy recommendation in our November 2022 edition in a 14-month timeframe on this stock. This year, we also consciously covered special situations such as buyback, open offers, buyouts etc. to give more actionable ideas to investors on their existing shareholdings. The call to tender the shares at ₹10,000 in the Bajaj Auto buyback citing the massive rally and the valuation expansion has worked well, with the shares now trading 11 per cent below. Ditto with the ‘subscribe’ recommendation to the Grasim Rights issue, which has paid off. On the other hand, we found that we did not see much success with ‘accumulate’ and ‘hold’ calls. Only six of our 20 ‘accumulate’ calls (Nippon AMC, Caplin Point Labs being examples) provided opportunities to accumulate on dips. We also found that the 15 ‘hold’ calls (expected to perform inline with the markets) didn’t work for us. But it is better to err on the side of caution. On the fixed income side, at the beginning of the year , we were very clear that while rate cuts may or may not happen in India in 2024, interest rates have peaked and that investors should make the best of the rates available. We found both the short-end and the long-end of the yield curve attractive and recommended bonds/mutual funds at these ends. Fast forward to end-2024 and 10-year G-Sec yields have dropped to 6.79 per cent from 7.21 per cent a year ago and a similar pattern can be seen across maturities. Investors have thus benefitted from a rally in bond prices this year. Keeping in tune with our cautious stance on equities as well as the expectation of a peaking out of interest rates, we carefully showcased options in categories such as balanced advantage, equity savings, multi-asset, ultra short-term as well as gilt/long-duration funds in our weekly ‘Fund Call’ space in the mutual fund section. For the risk-averse investors, we also recommended safer FD options across tenures from banks and NBFCs whenever attractive options came up. If you bet on gold as a diversifier this year, you would not be disappointed. Post gold’s decent 13 per cent upside in 2023 to end at $2,063 an ounce, we had predicted it to touch $2,200 this year (technical analysis) in our annual outlook published on January 14. We further followed it up with a more bullish case for gold in our article ‘Goldilocks moment for gold’, published on March 17 , as it neared $2,200 in early March. At that point, expectations of US Fed rate cut amidst some uncertainty on whether inflation battle was actually won or not, geopolitical turmoil in West Asia, Russia-Ukraine war and high government debt and fiscal deficit levels in developed countries, made the case for gold too good to ignore. Gold went on to hit a high of $2,790 in October this year. Although it has cooled off marginally from those levels, investors who had taken a cue from our writing would have been solidly rewarded. Rupee depreciation, too, has added to gains for investors in gold in India, offsetting some of the impact of customs duty cut in the July Budget. While we have been receiving your feedback regularly through mail or social media, 2024 has been a landmark year for brand bl.portfolio in terms of making an on-ground connection with readers/investors. Towards this, the first of the ‘bl.portfolio Investor Conclave’ was held in Coimbatore in June with a presentation followed by a panel discussion with various experts on the topic of retirement planning. This event was extremely well-received and enabled us to understand the mindset of our audience. There is a plan to do more such events especially in tier-2 cities in the coming year. With bl.portfolio being entirely behind paywall on our website, online subscribers are a lifeline. To reach out to them, we initiated subscriber-exclusive webinars this year. We have so far done one on US investing and another on the market outlook for 2025 is being planned soon. Our in-house technical analysis has a great following and to add value to these readers, we commenced our YouTube Shorts video series for the ‘Today’s Pick’ column (BL Today’s Pick: Stocks to Buy or Sell) this year. Our Nifty Prediction Weekly Video series, which has a big fan base, crossed a milestone of 100 episodes in March this year with 139 having been completed so far. This year, we also experimented with guest stories written by readers based on their personal investing experience. SEBI’s report on F&O trading put out in late September gave us this opportunity. Reader response to our call was overwhelming and at the same time, heart wrenching as well. We carried a few stories with their permission to help the larger investor community take away important lessons. As the New Year dawns, bl.portfolio will see new leadership at the helm. I step down after what has perhaps been the best four-and-a-half years both for the product as well as for me, professionally. The structural changes and demands that the pandemic brought about has seen team bl.portfolio grow from strength to strength in this period and am glad that I have been able to do my bit. The show will go on and if you are looking for best parking places for your money, fresh and unbiased perspectives await you in 2025 too, at bl.portfolio.

Title: 5 A.I. Trends to Watch in 2025: Agentic A.I., 3D Models, Synthetic Data and More

In the first eight months of 2024, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) collectively recorded a staggering $125 billion in A.I.-related capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating costs, according to a September JPMorgan report. The cumulative CapEx of these four tech giants alone is expected to soar past the $200 billion mark for the entirety of 2024. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A.I. startups, meanwhile, received unprecedented amounts of funding from investors eager to cash in on the technology’s lucrative potential. OpenAI is set to finish out 2024 as the most well-funded A.I. company, most recently valued at $157 billion. Its rival Anthropic is gearing up for new fundraising that cold value it at $40 billion. Flush with cash, leading A.I. companies are now tasked with the challenge of proving to investors—and the public—that their pricy bets on the new technology will pay off. From an ongoing pivot into “agentic A.I.” to emerging new scaling laws and wide-ranging explorations of A.I.’s myriad capabilities, here’s a look at what 2025 will bring to the world of A.I.: The buzzword refers to autonomous A.I. assistants able to complete tasks without human oversight. The potential of A.I. agents to enhance workplaces and everyday life quickly caught notice in Silicon Valley, with companies like Salesforce embracing agents as their next major product. Microsoft, too, has rolled out a slew of A.I. agents in recent months. In November, it unveiled several A.I. assistants customized for its Microsoft 365 suite, including an agent able to provide translation in nine different languages. OpenAI is also on the “agentic A.I.” train, with an upcoming model expected to be able to perform tasks like booking travel and writing code. A.I. agents are “the thing that will feel like the next giant breakthrough,” said Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, during a recent AMA on Reddit. The global market for A.I. agents is currently valued at more than $5 billion, according to the research firm MarketsandMarkets. By the end of the decade, this figure is expected to soar to $47 billion, driven in part by demand for agents amongst enterprise clients. One of the key components of A.I.’s success in recent years has been the mass amounts of data fed into A.I. models. But there’s only a finite amount of text, images and videos on the internet. To avoid a plateau in the technology’s development, A.I. companies are turning to alternative ways to train their models. One of the most promising solutions is test-time compute, where A.I. models improve by reasoning and taking longer to think about potential answers before responding—a theory most recently demonstrated by OpenAI’s o1 model. On an earnings call in November, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang described OpenAI’s new model as “one of the most exciting developments” in scaling and noted that “the longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.” Huang isn’t alone in his optimism. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also pointed towards test-time compute as a new scaling law in November, while OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever earlier this month highlighted it as a progression of A.I.’s pre-training era. Another solution to A.I.’s data crisis is replacing traditional data with information generated by the technology itself. The market for synthetic data is expected to skyrocket to $2.1 billion by 2028, representing an over 450 percent hike from 2022, according to BCC Research. Altman hinted at the potential of synthetic data a year ago when discussing A.I.’s dwindling data supply, remarking in an interview that “as long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model is smart enough to make good synthetic data, I think it should be all right.” OpenAI, alongside competitors like Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and Google, have all reportedly begun using synthetic data in some way to train and fine-tune models. In October, the A.I. startup Writer unveiled a new A.I. model trained entirely by A.I.-generated data. The approach allowed the company to cut significant costs in developing the model, which totaled at a mere $700,000 in comparison to the millions doled out by other companies. OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, for example, cost more than $100 million to train. Until now, much of A.I.’s visual outputs have remained two-dimensional, something tech pioneers are looking to shift in the coming years. “Large world models” are an emerging form of A.I. that aims to build interactive three-dimensional scenes advancing the worlds of movies, games and simulators. One of the largest players in this space is World Labs, a new startup established by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li that raised $230 million earlier this year. The venture is looking to build large world models with “spatial intelligence,” a form of intelligence that understands and interacts with the real world. To demonstrate this concept, Li has previously used the example of a cat reaching out to topple over a glass of milk and humans’ ability to predict the consequence of this event and therefore take action to prevent the glass from falling. At the beginning of December, Google DeepMind launched its own large world model in the form of Genie 2, which simulates virtual environments that will be used to train and evaluate A.I. agents. The area will likely be a key focus for the lab going forward, as evidenced by its recent hiring of Tim Brooks, a former OpenAI researcher overseeing its video generator Sora. In an X post welcoming Brooks to his team, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis noted his excitement at “working together to make the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality.” Google has long had a seemingly untouchable dominance on the search market. But with the advent of A.I., a proliferation of A.I.-powered search engines is looking to shake the tech giant’s foothold. Not that Google hasn’t embraced the technology itself. In 2024, it rolled out AI Overviews, a feature that provides users with A.I.-generated summaries rather than links. CEO Sundar Pichai predicts the feature will attract more than 1 billion users monthly users and is already “increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction,” he told Wall Street analysts in October. But Google will have to contend with an increasingly crowded industry for search tools, as companies like OpenAI and Microsoft expand into the arena with the help of A.I. Meta is also reportedly preparing to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine, while the startup Perplexity AI has emerged as an especially formidable player. Recently valued at $9 billion, its A.I. search tools already process around 20 million queries on a daily basis, up from 2.5 million at the beginning of 2024.

Title: Billionaire David Tepper’s Long-Term Stock Pick: Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stands Out

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire David Tepper's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other long-term stock picks of Billionaire David Tepper. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management is a multi-billion dollar hedge fund that was co-founded by billionaire Carolina Panthers owner Tepper in 1993. The fund was initially launched with a focus on distressed debt, which Tepper had years of experience in following a seven-year run as a credit analyst and head trader at Goldman Sachs. Appaloosa quickly built a name for itself on the backs of those distressed equities and Tepper’s aggressive investment style, returning 57% within its first six months of operation and has delivered impressive compound returns of greater than 25% since inception. It was managing $800 million in assets within five years of launching, which has since grown to $16.8 billion as of late 2023. That figure would be much greater if not for the fact that Tepper began transitioning his fund into a family office in 2019, beginning the process of returning money to outside investors. By 2022, nearly 90% of Appaloosa’s assets were owned by either Tepper, his family, or Appaloosa employees. Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio contained just 38 long positions heading into the final quarter of 2024, and was valued at $6.73 billion, up from $6.18 billion at the end of June. The fund added four new positions to its portfolio during Q3, while unloading three former holdings. Tech stocks held a dominant position in the fund’s portfolio for the third straight quarter, accounting for 38.5% of its value. The fund also had significant exposure to both communications and consumer discretionary stocks, at 24.6% and 23.1% respectively. Appaloosa’s exposure to various sectors was markedly different just five quarters earlier, when tech stocks accounted for just 7.1% of its 13F portfolio, while energy and utilities stocks came in at 15% and 21.7% respectively. The fund also had much greater exposure to healthcare stocks at that time, which accounted for 9.2% of its portfolio value, compared to just 2.4% at the end of September 2024. Of particular note is not just the sector allocations of Tepper’s fund, but also where those stocks originate from. Appaloosa’s top two stock picks are both Chinese stocks, as are 4 of its top 12 equity holdings. The fund has also built a stake in a major Chinese large-cap ETF. The bulk of those China-based additions to Appaloosa’s portfolio have come within the past five quarters, just ahead of major stimulus initiatives and economic policy shifts by the Chinese government that have helped spur in a rebound in the world’s second-largest economy. In a September interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Tepper noted that despite some recent gains in Chinese stocks, they are still trading significantly below past valuations and at just single-digit earnings multiples despite double-digit growth rates. He contrasted that to the S&P trading at a 20+x multiple to highlight the ongoing attractiveness of Chinese stocks. Tepper added that the Chinese government has exceeded expectations when it comes to its stimulus plans, which should bode very well for the Chinese economy in the months and years to come. Given Appaloosa’s highly concentrated portfolio and the relatively short timeframes with which it overhauls its holdings, there is notable value in focusing on those stocks that the fund has held on to for several years. The following data is gathered from Appaloosa Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). That’s why you should pay close attention to this important indicator. Note: All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ active funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2024 reporting period. Value of Appaloosa Management’s 13F Position (9/30/2024): $417 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (9/30/2024): 284 Ranking second on the list of Appaloosa’s top long-term holdings is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has had a place in the fund’s 13F portfolio since Q1 2020. The fund cut its stake in the tech giant by 18% during Q3 to 970,000 shares, with the stock ranking as its fourth-largest position overall. Hedge fund ownership of Microsoft was flat during Q3 and has dipped by 9% over the past year. Some investors are worried that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s lead in cloud services and generative AI is wilting, which has forced it to boost its genAI-related capital expenditures. While that could drag down free cash flow in the near term, the investments are expected to begin paying dividends in the second half of the company’s fiscal 2025, when new capabilities are rolled out for Azure. Barclays predicts Microsoft’s Azure growth will accelerate in the second-half of FY25 to between 31% and 32%, while UBS is even more bullish, projecting 34% year-over-year growth. Loop Capital predicts that Microsoft’s free cash flow will still grow at a strong CAGR of 18% through FY27 despite the capex constraints, before accelerating to as high as 40% growth in FY30. The firm has a $550 price target on Microsoft. RiverPark Large Growth Fund expects continued double-digit revenue and EPS growth for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) according to its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top detractor in the third quarter following a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that featured inline operating metrics but mixed guidance. Positively, the company reported strong revenue (+15%) and earnings growth (+10%), powered by Azure (+30%), and operating margins of 43%. Guidance however calls for lower than expected fiscal first quarter Azure revenue as infrastructure constraints limit growth, and higher capital expenditures throughout the company’s fiscal 2025 to alleviate these constraints. The company expects growth to reaccelerate in the back half of fiscal 2025 as more AI capacity comes online. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd among Billionaire David Tepper's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Also: This pocket camera has fully replaced my iPhone for video shooting Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: Big Tech’s H1B Arguments Aren’t Just FALSE… They’re Also Immoral.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/27/2024 10:11:47 PM PST by SoConPubbie A fierce debate has broken out between President-elect Donald J. Trump’s very recent tech industry supporters and his long-standing America First base. At the core of the disagreement is the subject of legal immigration—specifically, how Trump should handle so-called “high-skilled” foreign worker programs like the H1B visa.One of the staunchest proponents of expanding the labor pool in this way is billionaire Elon Musk. In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well.

I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well.

Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage.

They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. 15 posted on 12/28/2024 1:39:08 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: FLT-bird Interesting points.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly.

I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners.

ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs.

That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good.

Until this is fixed, we will continue to send our jobs to workers off-shore, and off-shore workers on-shore.I'm a contractor. I do projects for large banks. It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners.

But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs.

That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury.

Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. Interesting points. It’s kind of like putting a tariff on H1B workers so other countries don’t dump them here. Off-Topic: Is your tagline a reference to the movie “Signs”? I'm a contractor. I do projects for large banks. It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH!

They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Google’s blowout earnings report in April, which sparked the biggest rally in Alphabet shares since 2015 and pushed its market cap past $2 trillion for the first time, tempered fear that the company was falling behind in artificial intelligence. As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google’s employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company’s workforce. “We’ve noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce,” one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. “How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company’s success?” The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. “Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases” another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company’s vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday’s close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai’s vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai’s standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google’s grip on U.S. search. The company’s share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had “offended our users and shown bias,” according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. “We definitely messed up on the image generation,” Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. “It was mostly due to just not thorough testing.” The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google’s traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked “How many rocks should I eat each day,” the tool said, “According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day.” AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren’t hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview’s launch shouldn’t discourage them from taking risks. “We should act with urgency,” Reid said. “When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won’t always find everything and that just means that we respond.” Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ’s request represents the agency’s most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won’t have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company’s AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube’s combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple’s AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company’s cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company’s Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. “Google does not have one single visionary leader,” a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. “Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.” In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan’s and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of “chief scientist,” but internally, he is now listed as an “IC,” or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai’s leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should’ve happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google’s scrappy roots. He’s flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said. A few employees say they’re no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more “cost efficiencies” across the company in order to invest more in AI. “I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities,” Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a “Central Reorg Support Team Partner.” The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff’s “ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.” “Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,” one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. “Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,” another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai’s leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn’t violate any of the company’s “AI principles.” However, documents and reports show the company’s agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that “Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.” In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google’s security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. “This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company “carefully confirmed” that every person terminated was involved in the protests. “By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.” That round of job eliminations underscored Google’s clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company’s original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker’s age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for “Google,” spelled out in the font of IBM’s logo.

And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said. A few employees say they’re no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more “cost efficiencies” across the company in order to invest more in AI. “I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities,” Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a “Central Reorg Support Team Partner.” The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff’s “ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.” “Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,” one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. “Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,” another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai’s leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn’t violate any of the company’s “AI principles.” However, documents and reports show the company’s agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that “Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.” In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google’s security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. “This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company “carefully confirmed” that every person terminated was involved in the protests. “By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.” That round of job eliminations underscored Google’s clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company’s original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker’s age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for “Google,” spelled out in the font of IBM’s logo.

Title: Analyst on Alphabet (GOOG): ‘Take a Deep Breath and Look Through Antitrust Stuff’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Wall Street is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO Sylvia Jablonski said in a recent program on Bloomberg that there are trillions of dollars of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to be invested in AI amid demand that is at an all-time high. “There’s a biggest wealth transfer of our generation happening as we speak. And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they’re allocating their funds to. And, you know, retail has definitely spoken, and institutions have definitely spoken, and they’re looking for that, that fourth industrial revolution allocation.” Sylvia also talked about the relationship between quantum computing and AI and explained how this technology would improve AI systems: “So chatbot AI is, you know, kind of version one. Quantum is taking everything to the next level. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly. It will help, you know, essentially health care, cryptography, aerospace and defense, you know, blockchain technology. Anything you can think of will be better, too, with quantum supercomputing power.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks that are currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 160 Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management chief marketing strategist, made the case for Alphabet during a program on CNBC and said he believes the stock is undervalued. “I would urge investors to look through the antitrust stuff, which I would say will take at least half a decade to play out. Use this as an opportunity to crunch the numbers. It’s now selling at its lowest PE relative to the market of all time—about 80% of the market PE in an expensive market. This is the one MAG7 stock I really like. It can perform well if it hits its earnings numbers, it’s not overly expensive, and it offers a nice way to invest in that space even if you’re cautious about the other valuations.” Grisanti also reminded investors about Microsoft’s anti-trust issues back in the day and the stock performance: “I’d ask investors to take a deep breath. I am old enough to remember Microsoft in the late ’90s and their six-year battle with the antitrust authorities, where the government sought to break up the company. Microsoft lost the first round but eventually prevailed on appeal. During that time, the stock tripled.” The market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79—a roughly 11% outperformance. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google’s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader. What are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August. This growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day—substantially higher than Uber’s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber’s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo’s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing. In the third quarter, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion. Google Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit—a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment’s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: FedEx Corporation To Spin-Off FedEx Freight Business In 1H26
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2024/12/27/fedex-corporation-to-spin-off-fedex-freight-business-in-1h26/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T18:02:33Z

(Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images) Deal Overview On December 19, 2024, FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX, $278.66, Market Capitalization: $67.1 billion) announced that its Board of Directors had concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation of FedEx Freight through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company (for more information, visit spinoffresearch.com). Earlier, FedEx disclosed in June 2024 that it was weighing options for the LTL business, which involves carrying multiple shipments from different customers on a single truck. The Company intends to execute the planned separation through a capital markets transaction, creating two independent, publicly listed, industry-leading companies. The transaction is expected to qualify as a tax-free separation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to commence the separation process immediately, with the intent to execute the transaction within 18 months, subject to regulatory and certain other conditions and final approval of the FedEx Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as the financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel. FedEx Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders The Company also announced its 2Q25 results on 12/19. The Company revised its FY25 outlook, where the Company expects flat revenue year over year, compared to the prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase. The Company expects Diluted EPS of $16.45 to $17.45 before the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments compared to the prior forecast of $17.90 to $18.90 per share; and $19.00 to $20.00 per share after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $20.00 to $21.00 per share. Key Data Deal Rationale The spin-off of the Freight business was announced as FedEx trimmed its full year profit forecast, highlighting how FedEx’s main businesses continue to struggle with weak demand, especially in the U.S. at its Express unit. As per Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer, it is the right time to pursue a separation while the company navigates through the unique dynamics of the LTL market. Analysts have long argued that Freight was undervalued within FedEx, which has been slashing expenses and consolidating its express and ground operations to compete with delivery rivals like Old Dominion (ODFL), United Parcel Service (UPS), XPO (XPO), and Saia (SAIA). Year to date, the Company’s stock gained 10.5%, underperforming the S&P 500 index by 16.8%. With the spin-off of Freight from the rest of the Company, the management believes it will be able to achieve a premium valuation for its Freight business similar to its LTL competitors, most notably Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL). FedEx Freight, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, is estimated to have an enterprise value of more than $30 billion within the next 18 months, while a leading brokerage firm estimates the value between $30 billion and $35 billion. FedEx has identified strategic opportunities in separating FedEx Freight into an independent company while maintaining collaborative ties. The separation will enhance operational focus, accountability, and agility, enabling both entities to capture profitable growth and unlock market value. FedEx will continue advancing initiatives like DRIVE, Network 2.0, and Tricolor. Distinct public stock listings will provide unique investment profiles, strengthening the value proposition for each Company. Both entities will have strong balance sheets, allowing flexibility for growth investments and shareholder returns. Operational, commercial, and technological synergies will be preserved through agreements to ensure continuity, enhance speed, and reduce costs. The FedEx brand will remain unified, extending its values of speed, reliability, and trust across both businesses, with the new Company operating as FedEx Freight. Post separation, FedEx expects to deliver significant value to its stockholders through its transformation and strategic initiatives, focused on reducing the Company’s cost to serve while helping customers compete and win with the world’s smartest and most efficient logistics ecosystem. The initiatives underway through DRIVE are expected to create $4 billion in cost savings by the end of FY25. In comparison, Network 2.0 is targeted to generate savings of $2 billion by the end of fiscal year 2027, supporting enhanced profitability and driving greater flexibility and efficiency across the network. FedEx remains committed to a continued strong balance sheet at both entities while continuing to reduce capital intensity and increase capital returns. Post spin-off, FedEx Freight will be the largest LTL carrier with the broadest network and fastest transit times in its industry. The Company already has a market share of around 17% and has deep and long-standing relationships with customers who value choice, simplicity, and reliability. With a focus on safety, facility utilization, revenue quality, and operational efficiency, FedEx Freight has maintained its leading market share position while increasing operating profit by nearly 2% on average per year over the last five years. The business has delivered approximately 1,100 basis points of operating margin expansion over the same period. FedEx Freight is expected to benefit from a strong balance sheet that will allow it to maintain and extend its leadership position in the LTL market. FedEx Corporation (FDX) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997, to serve as the parent holding Company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. The Company operated under two business segments, the Federal Express segment and the FedEx Freight segment. FY24 Segment Revenue and FY24 Geographical Revenue Federal Express Segment Federal Express pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader today, providing a range of rapid, reliable, time- and day-definite delivery services to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated air-ground express network. In connection with its one FedEx consolidation, on June 1, 2024, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were merged into Federal Express. As of June 7, 2024, Federal Express employed approximately 430,000 employees and had approximately 64,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), nearly 700 aircraft, and over 175,000 motorized vehicles in its global network. Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations. Federal Express also provides cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions. FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers — FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight Mexico offers FedEx Freight Priority to deliver cross-border and intra-Mexico LTL shipments door-to-door. Customers receive support from the FedEx Freight International Services team to monitor LTL freight shipments, review customer paperwork, and follow up to avoid shipping delays when shipments are crossing borders. FedEx Freight provides additional services to Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with industry leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight and Federal Express. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers with easy access to their account information. Customers can also process domestic and cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Web Services, FedEx API, and LTL Select. FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level. FedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment-to-the-door services and standard through-the-door service available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population. Premium through the- door service with packaging removal is available to 90% of the continental U.S. population. The services include flexible delivery windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with flexible pickup windows and label-less options. As of June 7, 2024, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 motorized vehicles from a network of approximately 360 service centers and had approximately 40,000 employees. Lance D. Moll is the President of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. Financial Overview 2Q25 For 2Q25, the Company recorded revenue of $21.97 billion, down by 0.9% YoY compared to $22.17 billion in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to decline in volume and fuel surcharges. Revenue decline was due to lower revenue growth in both FedEx Express and Freight segments. Operating income was $1.05 billion, down 17.6% YoY, compared to $1.3 billion in 2Q24. Operating income margin was 4.8%, down by 100 bps. The decline in operating income was due to lower demand for U.S. domestic package and freight LTL services impacted by macroeconomic factors, increased purchased transportation and wage rates, and higher business optimization costs. Net income for the period was $741 million, down by 17.7% YoY compared to $900 million in 2Q24, and diluted EPS was $3.03 per share, down by 14.6% YoY. 1H25 For 1H25, the Company recorded revenues of $43.5 billion, down by 0.7% YoY, due to lower volume and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement at both transportation segments. Additionally, 1H25 revenue was negatively affected by one fewer operating day at both of transportation segments and reduced demand surcharges at Federal Express. Operating income for the period was $2.1 billion, down by 22.8% YoY, with an operating margin of 4.9%, down by 140 bps compared to the prior year period. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower demand for U.S. domestic package and freight LTL services driven by macroeconomic factors, increased purchased transportation and wage rates, and higher business optimization costs. The results were also negatively affected by one fewer operating day and lower demand surcharges. This was partially offset by increased demand for international export package services, base yield improvements at Federal Express and FedEx Freight, and continued cost savings related to DRIVE. Net income for the period was $1.5 billion, down by 22.4% YoY compared to $1.98 billion in 1H24, and diluted EPS was $6.24 per share, down by 19.9% YoY. Segmental Information 2Q25 For 2Q25, The FedEx Express segment recorded revenues of $18.84 billion, up slightly by 0.4% YoY. The lower growth in revenue was due to lower priority package volume, the expiration of the contract (Sep 29) with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to provide the USPS domestic transportation services, and reduced fuel surcharges, partially offset by increased deferred package volume and improved base yields. Operating income for the period was $1.05 billion, up by 1.6% YoY, with an operating margin of 5.6%, up by 10 bps. The increase in operating income was due to higher base yields, partially offset by increased operating expenses. 1H25 Federal Express segment revenue was $37.1 billion, down slightly by 0.1% YoY, due to lower priority package and U.S. freight volume, partially offset by increased deferred package volume and improved yields. 1H25 revenue was also negatively affected by one fewer operating day and reduced demand surcharges. Federal Express segment operating income was $2.0 billion, down by 14% YoY, with a margin of 5.4%, down by 90 bps. The decline in operating income was due to increased operating expenses and one fewer operating day, partially offset by higher base yields. The increase in operating expenses was due to increased wage and purchased transportation rates, business optimization costs, and increased employee benefits, partially offset by lower fuel prices and continued benefits from DRIVE initiatives that drove a reduction in permanent cost structure. These initiatives included the continued transformation of its structural network, improving the efficiency of information technology and back-office functions, optimizing operations in Europe, and increasing linehaul efficiencies. FedEx Freight Segment 2Q25 For 2Q25, FedEx Freight segment revenue was $2.2 billion, down by 11.2% YoY, primarily due to lower shipment volumes and reduced yields. Operating income for the segment dropped significantly by 36.5% YoY to $312 million, impacted by the decline in revenue. Operating income margin dropped by 570 bps to 14.3%. The decrease in income was partly offset by reduced operating expenses, with a 22% YoY decline in combined fuel and purchased transportation costs due to lower fuel prices and shipment volumes. Salaries and employee benefits expenses fell by 4% YoY because of reduced staffing to align with lower volumes, though higher wage rates partially offset these savings. Depreciation expenses increased by 38% YoY, primarily due to the absence of a gain on facility sales recorded in 2Q24. 1H25 For 1H25, FedEx Freight segment revenue was $4.5 billion, down by 6.8% YoY, impacted by lower shipment volumes, reduced yields, and one fewer operating day compared to the prior year. Operating income was $751 million, down by 22.8% YoY, and with an operating margin of 16.7%, down by 340 bps. The decline in operating income was primarily due to the revenue shortfall, partially mitigated by lower operating expenses. Combined fuel and purchased transportation costs fell by 16% YoY, reflecting decreased shipment activity and lower fuel prices. Salaries and employee benefits expenses were down 2% YoY due to reduced staffing levels, although higher wage rates offset some of the reductions. Depreciation expenses rose by 17% YoY, attributed to the prior-year gain on the sale of facilities in 1H24. FY25 Outlook FedEx has revised its fiscal 2025 outlook, expecting approximately flat revenue YoY, a downgrade from its earlier forecast of low single-digit growth. Diluted EPS is now projected between $16.45 and $17.45, excluding mark-to-market (MTM) retirement plan accounting adjustments, down from the prior estimate of $17.90 to $18.90. Including adjustments for business optimization costs, EPS is forecasted at $19.00 to $20.00, also lower than the previous $20.00 to $21.00. The effective tax rate (ETR) is now expected to be around 24.0%, revised from 24.5%. While unable to forecast MTM adjustments due to potential material impacts on consolidated financial results, FedEx reaffirmed permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion from the DRIVE transformation program and capital spending of $5.2 billion focused on network optimization, fleet modernization, and automation. These projections assume stable economic conditions, fuel price expectations, planned stock repurchases, and no new adverse geopolitical or economic developments. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting 2Q results by $0.07 per diluted share. The Company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during FY25 for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the Company’s 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion.

The company that began 2024 in turmoil after Sam Altman's dramatic return has morphed from a cautious non-profit company to an AI powerhouse worth $157 billion. With a $13 billion investment from Microsoft and a deal to power Apple iPhones, the company is on track to generate $11.6 billion in revenue. Game over for all the other suckers trying to elbow their way into the AI market? Hardly. The money flooding into AI continued to reach tsunami proportions throughout 2024, with billions of dollars going into funding dozens of worthy competitors around the world, ranging from China’s Moonshot AI to Paris-based Mistral. During the last week of November alone, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI pocketed $4 and $5 billion respectively. Investors who once saw OpenAI as the new big thing in tech are spreading their bets across a field of nimble, hungry competitors and anything ending in AI could be the next frontrunner—especially after delays from OpenAI, including Sora, its ballyhooed audio cloning tool (and, supposedly, its next GPT model.) It seems like decades since ChatGPT burst onto the scene with its revolutionary chatbot, which users could communicate with as easily as talking to a friend. (The chatbot launched in November 2022 and added speech in September 2024.) Almost overnight it made Google search look antiquated, something that the olds use. These days, it’s probably the first thing a GenZ thinks about when someone says “AI.” The company that sparked the AI revolution with ChatGPT pushed the boundaries of AI capabilities in 2024 after the boom of GPT-3.5, releasing its multimodal GPT-4o in May with an unprecedented 88.7% score on the MMLU benchmark. By September, its new o1 model—which is supposed to handle complex reasoning—raised the bar again, achieving 83.3% accuracy on International Mathematics Olympiad questions—a massive leap from GPT-4o's 13.4%. With over 200 million weekly active users, OpenAI's influence ran so deep that Google, deep in the throes of the Innovator’s Dilemma, suddenly began to fear for its $160 billion search business. But money and fame don't guarantee a happy ending, especially in tech. Anyone remember the Blackberry? Google certainly isn’t going the way of the Blackberry any time soon. Besides, it’s not like it was caught with its pants down. OpenAI was launched in December, 2015 and two months later, the search giant unveiled its new Gemini Ultra foundational model, with the capacity to process 2 million tokens of context—making OpenAI’s GPT-4 look light weight. AI is so integral to Google that CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company is moving from mobile to an "AI-first" strategy. And not a second too soon: The switch to Gemini boosted the popularity of Google One—the tier that offers access to Gemini Ultra—to over 100 million subscriptions 24 hours after its release. We just crossed 100M Google One subscribers! Looking forward to building on that momentum with our new AI Premium Plan (launched yesterday) offering AI features like Gemini Advanced, plus Gemini in Gmail, Docs + more coming soon. https://t.co/m7zAVop7P6 pic.twitter.com/sMdwJeq0iU — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 9, 2024 Google is not just flexing technical muscle; ChatGPT is still widely used but Google may be onto something. Its foundational model also powers its RAG, short for "retrieval augmented generation," platform NotebookLM, which was first conceived to help people handle huge amounts of information and data on big amounts of files. The product didn’t move a needle until an update changed the way people used RAG models. Welcome, Google’s podcast generators. That feature alone was enough to boost the model’s popularity, and increase user engagement with a pretty active Reddit community, interesting social experiments and even some business applications to explore. “I think we’ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they’re using it every day,” Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs, told The Independent. Meanwhile, OpenAI has given us a voice mode to talk to, still keeps its 128k token context window, and under legal threat, removed its horny Scarlett Johanson voice. The Gemini lineup has been key for Google’s outstanding performance. Since January 2023, its stock price doubled, reaching an ATH on July 10, 2024. Smaller than Google, but probably as important in terms of its role in the boom of AI chatbots this year is San Francisco-based Anthropic. Founded by former OpenAI researchers, Anthropic emerged as OpenAI's most formidable challenger in 2024, turning heads with explosive growth and deep-pocketed backers. The rivalry between ChatGPT and Claude, Anthropic’s suite of large language models, is the equivalent of the Cold War in AI culture. When one company releases a feature, the other immediately strikes back. The two models are always competing for the top spot in the LLM Arena and the community is always trying to decide which one is the best. Anthropic’s revenue grew over 1,000% this year after the launch of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June, with a major part powered by third-party API users. Anthropic's rise mirrors the early days of OpenAI, but with an even steeper trajectory. And the investments keep flowing in. Amazon has poured $8 billion into the startup, while Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion. These cash infusions were also probably strategic bets from tech giants hedging against OpenAI's dominance, and a mirror of a proxy war between cloud computing providers, with Microsoft supporting OpenAI to benefit Azure versus Amazon supporting Claude to benefit AWS. Anthropic and OpenAI mine the gold, whereas Microsoft and Amazon basically sell the shovels. Anthropic's success is not just due to its models’ quality. Overall, the company pushes for a broader shift in the AI landscape. While OpenAI chased consumer popularity, Anthropic focused on specialized models that prioritized safety, betting that enterprise customers would pay premium prices for targeted solutions. In Europe, French startup Mistral AI raised eyebrows by securing $1 billion in funding and a $6 billion valuation in June. Its open-source models are matching GPT-4's capabilities at a fraction of the cost. To put this in perspective, this means, according to calculations by Trending Topics, that "Mistral AI is worth €105m per employee," making it the most valuable startup in European history. A recent upgrade called “Le Chat,” is being positioned as Mistral’s ChatGPT killer. It offers basically everything ChatGPT does—for free. It provides good outputs, handles code, generates images, supports agents and browses the web in real time. And Mistral is just getting started, with a planned expansion into the United States and a new office in the belly of the beast in Palo Alto, California. Chinese firms aren't just copying anymore—they're innovating. Even with a major embargo imposed by the United States in an attempt to stifle innovation, companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Baichuan AI, backed by massive government support, are developing models tailored for emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. They're building a parallel AI ecosystem that could rival anything coming out of San Francisco. Huawei, the massive telecom giant supported by the state, for example, released its own OS and is embedding it into its lineup of smartphones and home devices, creating a fully functional ecosystem. Another Chinese model, Yi Lightning beats GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the LLM Arena, the new Deepseek has come to compete against OpenAI’s reasoning model o1, and Baidu’s Ernie reached 100 million users in December 2023 and boosted its user base to over 200 million users in April 2024 According to the World Economic Forum, China’s AI market is estimated to top $61 billion next year with VCs pouring over $120 billion into AI ecosystems. Believe it or not, Meta plays the role of the good guy in this story. While competitors such as OpenAI and Anthropic fought over market share with expensive, locked-down models, Mark Zuckerberg's company took a different route: open sourcing its technology. Llama 3.2, released in September, showcases just how far Meta's open-source strategy has come. The model processes both text and images, powers everything from augmented reality apps to visual search engines, and with Meta looking to work with U.S. government agencies to use its model on national security applications. And beyond government and corporations, the Llama-powered Meta AI chatbot is a pretty promising ChatGPT competitor. Recently expanded into dozens of countries, the chatbot can generate images of similar or arguably better quality than Dall-e 3 and even animate them (which ChatGPT cannot), search the web, handle coding tasks, and imagine scenes on the spot. Beyond that, Meta has other generative AI models for audio generation, video editing, segmentation, drawing animation, and more With Llama 4 around the corner in 2025, promising even better handling of text, voice, and images, Meta's betting that open beats closed every time. The numbers back up Zuckerberg's gamble. Meta AI, the company's answer to ChatGPT, racked up 500 million monthly users, with India leading the charge. Over a million advertisers jumped on Meta's AI bandwagon in September alone, cranking out 15 million AI-generated ads. The company's revenue shot up 18.9% year-over-year to hit $40.6 billion in Q3, with ad impressions climbing 7% while prices rose 11%. All this AI goodwill doesn't come cheap. Meta's dumping $38 billion into capital expenditure this year, mostly on AI research and the hardware to run it. That includes cramming its data centers with 350,000 of Nvidia's prized H100 AI chips by year's end. But Zuckerberg's playing the long game. By partnering with cloud giants AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure to host Llama models, Meta's building an ecosystem that could reshape how AI technology spreads—and who profits from it. Not bad for a company that lost almost 75% of its value when it started to focus on the "metaverse" and grew 600% since its shift to artificial intelligence as its key business model. Is OpenAI still king of the hill? Technically, maybe. At least it is the most recognizable—and valuable—AI startup in the scene. But the hill itself has changed. The race isn't about raw power anymore—it's about trust, accessibility, and real-world impact, and a few of these areas, notably trust and safety, are a bit murky right now for Sam Altman’s unicorn OpenAI's early lead has evolved into a complex web of specialized players, each carving out their own niches. Some focus on consumer applications, others on enterprise solutions, and a few brave ones tackle the fundamental research that could unlock AGI. For the immediate future, Sam Altman seems very confident OpenAI can reach AGI next year, which would put OpenAI on top of the hill for probably a long, long time if—and this is as “if” as it can get—they succeed. However, other very respected and talented experts, like Meta’s chief of AI research Yan LeCun, believe such achievement is accomplishable in around 10 years or so. Whether you decide to be optimistic or pessimistic will depend on who’s your favorite rockstar. That said, the real winner of 2024's AI race is the users. Competition drives innovation, but it also forces companies to address concerns about safety, privacy, and accessibility. This is why the Amodei brothers left OpenAI to found Anthropic and why Ilya Sutskeyver left to found Safe Superintelligence. This is why Huawei developed its own mobile OS and used domestic technology to build one of the best phones of the year, why developers come up with customized, better versions of the most popular AI models, and why AI as a technology has become a social phenomenon in the last two years. As these AI titans battle for supremacy, they're building tools that transform everything from how we work to how we create and communicate. And that 'one AI to rule them all'? Maybe that was the wrong question all along. In 2025's AI landscape, diversity will likely play an important role. And that might be exactly what we need.

Title: HHW Gaming Presents The 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up, Plus Our Pick For Game of The Year

Source: Ubisoft Montpellier / Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown / 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up 2024 has come to a quick end. It has been a rollercoaster of year in video games; we break down the good, bad, and ugly in our wrap-up. 2023 was a year to remember, thanks to releases like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more, but don’t get it twisted. 2024 was no pushover due to so many solid releases. There was also some shaky news in the gaming industry, and we will discuss all that and hand out our award for Game of the Year. So let’s wrap up 2024. Source: PlayStation / PS5 Pro Sony’s worst-kept secret, the PS5 Pro, finally arrived after a year and some change of speculation and information leaks. The reveal of Sony’s powerful console refresh landed with a thud with news of the console’s $700 price tag, and that’s without a stand and disc drive because both accessories are optional, leaving many asking, did play have limits? Many then asked if this console was even necessary, despite the company knowingly marketing it to a more niche gamer who prioritizes graphics and frame rates. The consensus on the console at the end of the day was that it provides players with a significant boost in performance and fidelity, but it’s not something you need to rush out and buy. We shall see how the PS5 Pro fares in 2025 and if it was genuinely worth Sony even making it. Our prediction: we expect it to fare well in the new year as developers focus more on the PS5 and Pro models and no longer have to wor optimizing games for the PS4. Source: Bernard Smalls / iOne Digital / HHW Gaming / PS Portal / PlayStation The PS Portal was a big surprise win for Sony. When it was first revealed, the immediate question was, why? It didn’t run natively, had no Bluetooth capability, and was essentially just a companion accessory for the PS5 console, only working off the console’s Remote Play feature. When news of the device started circulating back in 2023, and photos began hitting the web, we immediately felt that Project Q, as it was called at the time, was Sony’s way of testing if they should get back in the still hot handheld market, Nintendo very much dominates that. That turned out to be the case, with PlayStation boss Hideaki Nishino saying that the PS Portal sales were a “huge success” story for the company and adding that the device would continue to “evolve.” With the addition of Cloud Streaming (Beta), we have seen signs of Sony actively developing a native handheld device that will not require you to be tethered to your PS5 console. Sony isn’t alone; Xbox is also working on a handheld device but has yet to pull the lid off what has come up with. Keeping it a buck, if you have been on the fence about the PS Portal, now is a better time than any to consider getting yourself one; this gamer truly appreciates how clutch it is when being in front of the television and console is not an option. Just make sure that the internet and Wi-Fi are up to snuff. Source: Xbox / Xbox Gaming x Amazon Fire TV As we approached the end of the year, Microsoft made its plans for the future abundantly clear: almost all of your devices, not just the black box, are Xboxes. Since Xbox’s mission was clear after its shaky start following the Activision /Blizzard/King acquisition, it was able to regroup after its epic failures. Desperate for wins, Xbox finally got some, but not the conventional way. Instead, they released console exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment, followed by Sea of Thieves and Grounded on the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. These titles became best sellers in the PlayStation Store despite lackluster console sales. The highly anticipated Senua’s Sacrifice: Hellblade II, another technical masterpiece from Xbox studio Ninja Theory, was also released in 2024. However, it was also a polarizing game, with critics divided on whether it was worth the wait and whether it should have been considered a big exclusive for the Xbox Series X. Two massive wins for Team Green had to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to Xbox Game Pass to high praise. 2025 can be an interesting year for Xbox. Yes, many people are still skeptical about the company’s plans moving forward, mainly because they feel their loyalty has been taken for granted. Still, Xbox was losing, and they realized they needed to pivot. They still have their mid-level refresh console, codenamed Brooklin, the aforementioned native handheld in the works, and plenty of games in the pipeline, so we are still very intrigued. Source: Microsoft / Xbox Yes, it was cool to discuss all of the good things that happened in 2024, but we would not be honest if we didn’t mention the layoffs and the shuttering of numerous video game studios. At the beginning of the year, Microsoft announced it was laying off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees. This was not a good look for a company that had just spent $69 billion to acquire the Call of Duty developer. It continued the trend from 2023 when an estimated 10,500 game industry workers lost their jobs. Xbox also shuttered four of its studios: Tango Gameworks, which delivered the surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush; Redfall developer Arkane Austin; Alpha Dog; and Roundhouse. PlayStation also got in on the act as well, laying off 900 employees in February 2024 and suffering what the biggest miss of the year with its hero shooter, Concord, which never really got to see the light of day following a very poor reception and eventually shuttering the studio behind it, Firewalk was was. Gaming journalism also suffered after Gamestop shut down Game Informer magazine after 33 glorious years and many fire cover stories and exclusives. Gamestop didn’t even give the magazine the proper sendoff it deserved, opting for a lame landing page when you visit the now-defunct publications landing page. What a sad way for the iconic magazine to end. Former Game Informer employees discuss the unceremonious end on the FPS Podcast below. Source: Ubisoft / The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown In a year that saw plenty of bangers like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Astro Bot, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Helldivers II, Tekken 8, and more, there can only be one HHW Gaming Game of The Year. But determining which game would win our prestigious Game of the Year award wasn’t hard. The winner is Ubisoft Montpellier’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. There was no doubt that The Lost Crown was a special title from the first time we booted it up in January. In our review of the game, our resident gamer, Beanz, wrote: The Last Crown is a masterpiece; I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with this game. The combat is snappy and fun to use thanks to the combo system and Sargon’s acquired abilities, allowing for stylish, fast gameplay. While Ubisoft Montreal is hard at work on the Sands of Time remake, Montpellier’s The Lost Crown is not just a placeholder; it’s the perfect pivot for the franchise, putting it on a refreshing path to newfound greatness. Sadly, Sargon’s journey will likely not continue because Ubisoft disbanded the Montpellier team, leaving the game in limbo. This development is disheartening because Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was a unique game with the potential to become a new hit chapter in the iconic video game franchise. We will keep our fingers crossed that Ubisoft will recognize the error of its ways with The Lost Crown, but we’re not holding our breath. Well, that’s it for 2024, onward to 2025. Keep it locked on HHW Gaming for the games we are looking forward to in 2025, and hit the gallery below for other games we thought were bangers in 2024.

The Dow fell sharply on Friday, dropping more than 500 points as tech giants within the so-called “Magnificent Seven” saw significant declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 542 points, or 1.25%, by Friday afternoon, erasing much of the market’s gains from the holiday-shortened week. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 slipped 1.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.3%. Additionally, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.58%. The tech sector faced widespread selling pressure, with the “Magnificent Seven” mega-cap stocks trading in the red. Amazon (AMZN-0.63%) slid 2.2%, Apple (AAPL-1.14%) lost 2%, Tesla (TSLA-2.88%) dropped 4.8%, Microsoft (MSFT-0.96%) fell 2.4%, Alphabet (GOOGL-0.39%), the parent company of Google, declined 2.5%, and Meta Platforms (META-1.16%) shed 2%. Investors continued to offload AI stocks on Friday, locking in profits during the holiday season. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-3.99%), Palantir (PLTR-1.89%), and Nvidia (NVDA+1.02%) — another Magnificent Seven stock — fell sharply, dropping by 5.5%, 3%, and 4.4% respectively.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on ARM Holdings plc (ARM): ‘I Prefer ARM Holdings Over Intel In The Current Tech Landscape’

Time Published: 2024-12-27T16:53:16Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). High angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 68 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-22-24 Performance Since Then: -2.20% ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British chip design house whose IP is present in the majority of smartphone processors and other chips. This enables the firm to enjoy a wide moat, which has strengthened in today's era of data centers and cloud computing. Big tech firms have used ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s designs to make in-house chips. The firm has also sought to further solidify its market presence by providing an off-the-shelf solution to firms looking to design chips. However, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s shares are down by 16% over the past six months as they have been driven by the firm's inability to significantly benefit from the ongoing AI boom despite its near-ubiquity in the smartphone industry. In August, Cramer shared that he preferred ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) over Intel, and the latter's stock has lost 5.6% since his comments: "Intel is struggling with competition from AMD and Nvidia, and I prefer ARM Holdings over Intel in the current tech landscape. Intel has challenges but may benefit if it can leverage AI advances effectively." Overall ARM ranks 6th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Escalating US-China Trade War to Hurt These Tech Stocks in 2025
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/escalating-us-china-trade-war-153500064.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T15:35:00Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The ongoing US-China trade war has intensified, with technology being a primary battleground. What began as a tussle over trade imbalances has evolved into a strategic clash over technological supremacy. Over the past few years, the United States has tightened its export restrictions, limiting China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies critical for Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G and supercomputing. Key players like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Intel Corporation INTC and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM have been caught in the crossfire, facing regulatory and market challenges that jeopardize their growth prospects. Recent measures, including the U.S. Commerce Department's export controls on advanced AI chips and chipmaking tools, aim to curb China’s technological advancements. While these restrictions align with the U.S. national security objectives, they have disrupted the semiconductor supply chain and stoked economic tensions. In retaliation, China has imposed restrictions on rare earth metals critical for semiconductor production. The escalating trade war has created a challenging environment for U.S. tech companies reliant on the Chinese market. As we step into 2025, uncertainties surrounding the conflict are poised to affect revenue streams, supply chains and investor sentiment. Here's a closer look at how leading semiconductor players like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and QUALCOMM could bear the brunt of these challenges. NVIDIA has been a proponent of the U.S. government’s restrictions throughout the past three years. In 2022, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. In 2023, the United States imposed new restrictions on selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market. This year, the U.S. government restricted the export of NVIDIA's advanced A100 and H100 GPUs to China, a key market for AI development. The U.S. government is continuing its efforts toward restricting China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. These kinds of restrictions are going to hurt NVIDIA’s business in China with a negative impact on its top line, margin and cash slows further jeopardizing its ability to support existing customers and complete the development of certain products timely. NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Micron Technology had found itself in the middle of this tug-of-war long ago. For the company, chip sales in China make up more than 10% of its total revenues. In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications with the intention of stopping these chips from getting into Chinese hands. Later in 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China imposed a restriction on Micron on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. Tit-for-tat actions like these have the potential to jeopardize the company’s prospects, which are already afflicted by the weak demand for its memory chips. Moreover, the memory chip market’s cyclical nature, combined with these geopolitical tensions, could exacerbate its financial volatility in 2025. Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Intel’s total revenues experienced a whopping 27% contribution from its Chinese customers in 2023. The company faces unique challenges due to its reliance on both China for manufacturing and the United States for research & development. China’s latest stance of replacing U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives has become a concern for Intel. The country’s latest decision to phase out foreign chips from its major telecom networks by 2027, coupled with the U.S. government’s directive to revoke Intel’s chip export licenses to the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei, has a big potential to affect the company’s top line. Although Intel has been heavily investing in its foundry business to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing, these efforts may take years to bear fruit. The company’s struggles to regain market leadership in the face of geopolitical headwinds could further pressure its bottom line and stock performance in 2025. Intel Corporation price-consensus-chart | Intel Corporation Quote QUALCOMM has a lot to lose from the US-China trade war as a major part of its business comes from China. The company has also set up multiple manufacturing facilities in China. In early 2024, Qualcomm faced the same restrictions as Intel where the U.S. government revoked its chip export license for certain technologies to Huawei. Retaliation from the Chinese trade associations and government can worsen QCOM’s situation. The Chinese government has already put policies, such as the Made in China 2025 initiative aiming for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025. These policies can enable QUALCOMM’s existing customers to develop their own chipsets . QUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote The escalating US-China tech war presents a formidable challenge for U.S. semiconductor companies like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and Qualcomm. These companies are not only grappling with the immediate effects of export restrictions and retaliatory measures but also facing long-term structural shifts in global supply chains and competitive dynamics. Investors should exercise caution and closely monitor developments in the trade conflict as these could significantly impact the semiconductor industry’s growth trajectory in 2025. While U.S. tech stocks have historically been robust performers, the geopolitical landscape could bring volatility that warrants careful portfolio positioning. At present, NVIDIA and QUALCOMM each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Micron and Intel each have a Zaks Rank #3 (Hold).

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently making headlines on the back of latest analyst ratings and important news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 Vijay Rakesh, Mizuho senior semiconductor analyst, said in a latest program on CNBC that Broadcom shares have more room to run: “Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), on the other hand, is just starting to put up massive numbers now. I think we like the name; they have a huge ramp coming up over the next two years. It’s very under-owned. People were cautious heading into earnings, and so we think there is probably some more legs left to the run.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: OpenAI may become a for-profit because it needs 'more capital than imagined'

OpenAI has revealed a plan to restructure its operations and more cleanly separate the for-profit and non-profit arms of its business as it seeks to raise more cash. The artificial intelligence startup has been discussing plans to restructure for several months now, according to various reports, as it tries to attract new investors. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion evaluation in its latest round of funding, which was reportedly led by Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital and backed by Microsoft (MSFT-0.96%) and Nvidia (NVDA+1.02%). But that’s not enough. “The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,” OpenAI’s board wrote in a new blog post. “We once again need to raise more capital than we’d imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.” Under OpenAI’s current structure, the company’s investors are issued equity by its for-profit arm, which is overseen by its non-profit board, whose “principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors.” The company announced its “capped profit” structure in 2019, after founding the company in 2015 as a non-profit. “As we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup — we have to become an enduring company,” OpenAI wrote, adding that its plans “enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space.” The ChatGPT maker’s new plan includes establishing the for-profit arm of OpenAI as a public benefit company (PBC), mirroring a step taken by xAI — helmed by OpenAI founder Elon Musk — as well as Anthropic. Although such companies have a stated goal of positively impacting society, the pivot to establish AI firms as PBCs has led to accusations of “ethicswashing.” By setting up the for-profit arm as a PBC, OpenAI’s current board will be able to consider the interests of investors more easily, which could help it win over potential shareholders. xAI, despite being less than two years old, raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation earlier this month, while Anthropic has raised almost $14 billion in venture capital since it was founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI employees. Although details were not revealed by OpenAI on Friday, previous discussions had explored giving CEO Sam Altman about $150 billion of equity, according to Reuters. The non-profit side of the business will hire its own leadership team and staff to engage in charity involving the healthcare, education, and science sectors, according to OpenAI. It will also own “significant interest” in the for-profit side through stock determined at a “fair evaluation” determined by third-party advisors. OpenAI’s plans face a few hurdles, including a slew of recent executive departures and a revived lawsuit from Musk, who wants to stop the company from becoming a for-profit. In November, Musk expanded his lawsuit against the AI startup and several of its co-founders, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior and calling it a “market-paralyzing gorgon.” Later in the month, Musk’s attorneys filed a preliminary injunction against the AI startup, several of its co-founders, and Microsoft to stop its transition to a for-profit company. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The AI stock trade is starting to shift beyond the 'Magnificent 7'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence has once again driven the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks to another banner year, with Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) stocks all recently hitting record highs while Nvidia (NVDA) shares boast a more than 175% gain this year. Next year, investors expect the hype to spread even further into areas like utilities and software stocks, which will continue to benefit from Big Tech's large AI bet. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin projects the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025 and that the rest of the market's gains will come closer to those of large-cap tech stocks. "It's less about valuation but more about earnings growth that will dictate those returns," Kostin said during a Goldman Sachs 2025 media roundtable with reporters. "The narrowing of the differential between the growth rates is likely to lead to a narrowing of [difference in] the performance." The rapid earnings growth seen in large caps over the past 18 months is expected to slow, while earnings are expected to pick up for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, issued a 6,666 year-end target for the S&P 500 in 2025 that includes a call for a broadening of earnings driven in part by AI. "AI is definitely playing a role in 2025 earnings," Subramanian told Yahoo Finance. "And in fact, one of the reasons that we're bullish on the broadening out of earnings is the idea that instead of everybody spending on tech capex, tech capex is actually picking up, and tech companies are sort of spending on a broader array of industries." To Subramanian's point, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta alone are expected to have increased capital expenditures by 42% in 2024 and another 17% in 2025, pushing their total spend next year to $244 billion. Not all of this spending is on AI chips. Tech companies are also ramping up spending to pay for the power required to run AI data centers. During a 2025 outlook roundtable with reporters, BlackRock's Investment Institute pointed out that the power required to operate one data center is about equal to the average amount of power used in a day by all of New York City. This has strategists, including BofA's Subramanian, bullish on the companies exposed to that part of the technology buildout, including the Utilities sector (XLU), which is already up more than 20% in 2024, partially driven by AI optimism. This part of the AI trade has already begun to shift. In his 2025 equity outlook, Kostin highlighted a basket of three potential AI trades, noting that the transition from "phase 1" stocks like Nvidia to "phase 2" stocks in Goldman's AI "infrastructure" bucket is already well underway. As seen in the dark blue line in the chart below, AI infrastructure stocks, which include other semiconductor companies like Arm Holdings (ARM) and utility power plays like Vistra Corp (VST), have already seen large rallies. In the year ahead, Goldman thinks the changing of the AI guard will further take hold as the trade moves to "phase 3" under a basket of stocks Goldman has dubbed "enabled revenues." These are a group of companies that will benefit from the rollout and monetization of AI solutions. In other words, those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. A large portion of this basket of stocks that Goldman is tracking are software and services stocks, including names like Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and Adobe (ADBE). And as seen in the sharp move higher in the lighter blue line in the graph below, "phase 3" AI stocks are already catching a bid. For example, Salesforce shares recently added more than 10% after reporting earnings and citing the success of its new AI tool, Agentforce. Goldman added that this isn't necessarily a call for AI infrastructure stocks to underperform the market in 2025 but rather to point out which portions of the AI trade could have more upside. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon agreed. As the AI trade enters its next phase, "there should be more focus, or an increasing amount of focus, on the adopters versus the creators," Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

US stocks opened on a downbeat note as Wall Street slogged to the finish of a largely triumphant year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 2.2% Friday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gave up 1%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. After stacking impressive gains this year, some of the biggest names in tech are losing ground as investors take profits, rebalance their portfolios, or reassess their lofty valuations. Tesla (TSLA) on Friday lost more than 4%. Nvidia (NVDA) gave up 3%, while Amazon (AMZN) decreased by 2.5%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains, but markets have been unable to mount a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. Markets have largely digested the year's remaining key economic data points, and investors are now turning their attention to two big themes for the coming year: the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump's ascent back to the White House. On the former, stocks have largely taken in stride the Fed's plans to scale back rate cuts next year after an initial plunge last week. Bets have now shifted squarely to May as the next meeting at which the Fed will slash interest rates, as it continues to grapple with stubborn inflation while keeping a close eye on a cooling labor market. And on the latter, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul writes that while Trump talked up his big plans during the campaign, especially on the economy, those plans could soon face a reality check from other key power players. The US government long had the nation’s biggest tech giants in its sights, and in 2024, it hit bull's-eye. The big victory came in August when the Justice Department convinced a federal district court judge that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) had abused its search engine dominance and violated antitrust law. What transpired in 2024 could have future implications for some of the other big names in the tech world, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims. For now, Wall Street doesn't appear rattled. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks of the world's largest technology companies helped push the market higher in 2024, thanks partly to advancements around artificial intelligence. But the incoming Trump administration adds another layer of uncertainty to the next chapter of Big Tech antitrust enforcement.

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains and is hoping to resume a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up more than 26% on the year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is up over 30%. The blue-chip Dow (^DJI) has risen a more modest 14%. Airline stocks soared in 2024. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Index has climbed 60% for the year — its biggest yearly gain in a decade, Bloomberg reports. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has risen roughly 27% over that time frame. While major airlines Delta (DAL), United (UAL), Alaska (ALK), and JetBlue (JBLU) were all down slightly Thursday, they are set to post yearly gains far ahead of their S&P 500 peers. United Airlines is the best performer of the group — its stock soared 144% in 2024. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group shares are up nearly 72% for the year. Delta Air Lines rose 55% in that timeframe, and JetBlue climbed 41%. American Airlines' (AAL) performance was in line with its peers, while Southwest Airlines' (LUV) 18% gain for the year fell behind.

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. "Google does not have one single visionary leader," a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. "Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed." In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of "chief scientist," but internally, he is now listed as an "IC," or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google's scrappy roots. He's flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google's Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company's hit AI products in 2024. After Brin's hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google's position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they've seen Brin walking around the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they're pursuing. Despite Brin's reemergence, several employees told CNBC they're doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn't strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it's hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company's AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco's waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of "Wicked" actors, where one, labeled "execs" looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled "Gemini" while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as "users." A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. "Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company's future, and are proud to work here," the spokesperson said. A few employees say they're no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google's CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more "cost efficiencies" across the company in order to invest more in AI. "I think any organization can always push a little further and I'll be looking at additional opportunities," Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a "Central Reorg Support Team Partner." The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff's "ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations." "Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do," one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. "Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people," another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai's leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn't violate any of the company's "AI principles." However, documents and reports show the company's agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that "Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations." In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google's security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. "This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe," a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company "carefully confirmed" that every person terminated was involved in the protests. "By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable." That round of job eliminations underscored Google's clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars' Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company's original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker's age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for "Google," spelled out in the font of IBM's logo. WATCH: Google's fate hinges on this man: Demis Hassabis Got a confidential news tip?

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025.

Ruslan Desyatnikov is Founder and CEO of QA Mentor, Inc., an independent software-testing company headquartered in New York. As the tech sector faces unprecedented upheaval and widespread layoffs, the QA industry is feeling the impact, grappling with new uncertainties. This shifting landscape presents significant challenges that demand our attention. It’s time to confront how these changes are reshaping the world of quality assurance and what it means for professionals in the field. From 2022 to 2023, major tech firms carried out significant job layoffs. Amazon let go of 27,000 workers, Meta dismissed 21,000 and Microsoft laid off 10,000. These figures have only grown as we moved into 2024, as over 500 tech companies have made job cuts, resulting in over 100,000 employees losing their jobs since the start of this year. This is a world away from 2020-2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation that led to heightened demand for tech products and services, such as remote work tools, e-commerce platforms and digital entertainment. During this period, tech companies saw stock prices soar on investor optimism in a pandemic-changed world. Global central banks kept interest rates low to aid economic recovery, allowing tech firms affordable borrowing for growth. Government stimulus and aid bolstered businesses, including tech, amid pandemic uncertainties. As the global economy faced renewed challenges around 2022, including rising inflation and interest rates, tech giants shifted gears from their aggressive hiring stance of 2020-2021. Now, they're cutting back on hiring and implementing layoffs to ensure financial stability post-pandemic. This abrupt change is reshaping employees' career trajectories from optimism to uncertainty almost overnight. In this industry upheaval, the QA sector must seize the opportunity to leverage automation and AI to stay competitive. As AI testing solutions advance, QA professionals need AI tools to remain marketable. By integrating AI, companies can: • Optimize efficiency with AI. AI-driven tools quickly spot patterns and anomalies often missed by traditional methods, streamlining testing, cutting manual work and boosting productivity. AI also prioritizes test cases based on data, ensuring focus on critical areas. • Control costs through predictive AI. AI reduces manual labor by predicting defects early, minimizing rework and errors. AI-driven resource management enhances efficiency and keeps budgets lean. • Enhance human resource allocation. With routine tasks automated, QA teams can tackle complex challenges and innovation. AI augments human expertise, allowing teams to focus on strategic initiatives and elevate service delivery. • Develop new AI-driven services. Adopting AI enables companies to create new testing services tailored to evolving market needs. AI offers the scalability and adaptability needed to stay ahead with innovative solutions. • Modernize workflows using AI. AI accelerates test execution by auto-generating cases and scripts, improving accuracy and ensuring consistent, reliable results across environments. • Strengthen risk management. AI-powered testing tools help identify potential risks early in the process, offering predictive insights that reduce the likelihood of critical failures. This proactive approach helps ensure higher-quality releases and mitigates costly issues in production. To effectively address the challenges facing the QA industry, companies must adopt a comprehensive approach that includes targeted employee training and upskilling. Here are some concrete steps to enhance your QA team's capabilities: • Implement continuous learning programs. Focus on advanced testing frameworks such as Selenium, Appium and JUnit to ensure QA engineers are proficient in the latest tools and methodologies. • Equip teams with knowledge. Provide training in areas like API testing, security testing and performance testing using tools like Postman, OWASP ZAP and Apache JMeter. • Foster expertise in test automation scripts. Encourage the use of languages like Python, Java and JavaScript to keep teams agile and adept at handling evolving testing requirements. • Provide certifications in cloud-based testing platforms. Offer certifications for tools such as AWS Device Farm or Sauce Labs to prepare QA professionals for future testing in cloud environments. • Incorporate hands-on workshops and real-world project simulations. Integrate these into training programs to significantly improve practical skills. • Invest in employee development. Provide access to industry conferences and webinars to keep teams updated on the latest trends and best practices in QA. In the context of present challenges, sticking to traditional methods is no longer sufficient. To stay competitive, companies must integrate data-driven insights into their quality assurance strategies. Here’s how to leverage data effectively: Begin by utilizing analytics tools to thoroughly analyze test results, track performance metrics and uncover patterns. This approach provides a clearer picture of where to direct your testing efforts and how to refine your processes. Predictive analytics can help you anticipate potential issues before they become critical, reducing the risk of defects in production. Optimizing resource allocation becomes more precise with data. By understanding workload and performance metrics, you can ensure that high-priority tasks receive the necessary focus and attention. Data insights also help refine test coverage strategies, revealing gaps and overlaps to ensure comprehensive and targeted testing. To foster continuous improvement, establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly review metrics related to testing efficiency, defect rates and resolution times. This practice highlights areas for enhancement and validates the effectiveness of changes made. Cultivating a data-driven culture is essential. Equip your QA teams with the skills and tools to interpret data effectively, promoting a proactive approach to quality assurance and driving excellence in your testing processes. The tech sector’s massive layoffs have sent shockwaves through the QA industry, creating a climate of uncertainty and demanding urgent adaptation. Yet, within this upheaval lies a golden opportunity for QA teams to embrace AI, automation and data-driven strategies. By optimizing efficiency, controlling costs, modernizing workflows and upskilling employees, QA professionals can turn disruption into innovation. It's time for the industry to shed its old skin, rise above the chaos and redefine what quality assurance means in a post-pandemic world. The future belongs to those who can navigate the turbulence with agility and foresight. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?

Title: Drill, Baby, Drill 2.0: Why Trump’s Return Will Bring Blockbuster Years For Natural Gas

In October 2008, with the economy reeling from the onset of the Great Recession and oil prices having spiked to $147 per barrel ($211 in today’s money), Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden was asked during a debate to contrast his party’s energy policy with that of the Republicans. Biden said that their “only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to be drilled.” His vice presidential opponent Sarah Palin pounced; “The chant is ‘drill, baby, drill.’ And that’s what we hear all across this country… because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.” Biden and Obama won that election, though Biden woefully underestimated American ingenuity. During the Obama years drillers boosted natural gas production by 45% to 92 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), while oil output more than doubled to 9 million barrels per day (bpd). But the frackers were too successful, causing a global oil glut that drove prices down to $28/bbl in 2016 and bankrupted dozens of companies. The industry recovered during the first Trump term; with executives refocused on growing profits. Despite the industry’s antipathy for Joe Biden, U.S. oil output has climbed steadily during his presidency to a record 13 million bpd of oil and 125 bcfd of natural gas today. And again the world is in an oil glut. Prices are currently hovering around $70/bbl and OPEC is holding back nearly 5 million barrels per day of untapped production capacity against the world’s daily 103 million barrels of consumption. Meanwhile Chinese oil companies are predicting peak oil demand as widespread electric vehicle usage in the nation is replacing gasoline guzzlers. “The fundamental outlook is bearish,” writes oil analyst Michael Hsueh at Deutsche Bank. This is why the resurgence of Drill, Baby, Drill under the second Trump term will focus not on oil, but rather natural gas. Biden has been a decidedly anti-gas president. The biggest affront: in 2022 he instituted a moratorium on new approvals of liquefied natural gas export projects. In recent years LNG exports from the U.S. have grown from nothing to 12 billion cubic feet per day, about 8% of total domestic supply. Despite the permit ban, projects already approved and under construction have continued apace, and are set to more than double U.S. exports. According to Neil Beveridge, analyst with Bernstein Research, “The expected glut of LNG is still coming, but it has been delayed, with maximum supply now expected in 2026 or 2027” – just in time for Trump (who is widely expected to reverse Biden’s ban) to take credit. A large portion of U.S. LNG heads to Europe to replace sales of Russian pipeline gas halted by the war on Ukraine, and to Asia, where it lessens reliance on the burning of far dirtier and carbon-intensive coal for electricity. Supplying LNG to the world is only half of the Drill, Baby, Drill equation. New demand for electricity in the United States is set to surge during the Trump years, particularly because of the rise in artificial intelligence. McKinsey, the consultancy, figures that the electricity needed to power A.I. data centers will grow from 25,000 megawatts today to 83,000 mw by 2030. This could cost upwards of $300 billion of capital investment in power plants, buildings, transmission lines and server farms. Data centers power demand would grow to some 12% of all U.S. electricity, up from 5% now. Drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania. Observing this coming need for power, Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI and others have invested billions into everything from solar and wind to advanced nuclear and geothermal. Investors in new publicly traded nuclear startup Oklo include Chris Wright, Trump’s incoming Secretary of Energy and Sam Altman of OpenAI. Oklo says it will work with developer Switch to roll out 12,000 megawatts of new nuclear by 2044. That’s a lot, but won’t come soon enough. Until advanced nuclear is a real thing, gas has proven it is the only scalable bridge fuel capable of displacing coal. Over the past 20 years U.S. has reduced coal consumption 63% from peak down to 400 million tons per year, while natural gas use is up by more than half to 33 trillion cubic feet per year. As a direct result, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are down 15% over this period, the most of any developed nation. (China, by the way, continues to use record amounts of coal, 5 billion tons last year.) So the tech giants are turning to gas. One example: Meta recently announced plans to build a datacenter and 2,200 megawatt gas-fired plant in West Richland Parish, Louisiana, at a cost of $10 billion. Meta’s gas supplier is likely to be Occidental Petroleum, whose shares are down 20% this year to $48. Oxy is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s top holdings. Over the the summer it added several million more shares in the petroleum company at a price of nearly $60 per share. Investment analyst Chris Dowd at Third Avenue Management sees good times ahead for a cadre of other gas-focused exploration and production companies. These days he says his team is “licking its chops” on a micro-cap called SandRidge Energy. The Oklahoma City-based SandRidge (market cap: $406 million) emerged from bankruptcy a couple years ago and carries virtually no debt against a portfolio of some 450,000 acres of gas fields in the Mid-Continent area of Oklahoma and environs. Dowd loves that SandRidge has been keeping some of its wells “shut in” – holding on to gas in the ground rather than sell it at what has been historically low prices over the past year. Dowd says SandRidge has the potential to boost output 20% in short order to respond to LNG and A.I. demand. The company also has $1.6 billion of past operating losses to shield future earnings from federal income taxes. Biden’s permitorium “gummed up the inventory” of new wells needing to be drilled and fracked, says Dowd. “Once we get that flowing and don’t have the start-stop, we will have the machine really humming.” Coterra Energy is “another one that is a coiled spring,” says Dowd. “If we have ‘drill, baby, drill’ they can really lean in to adding production.” Coterra ($18 billion market cap) has been aggressive in buying back stock, but has a richer P/E of 15. Dowd prefers SandRidge. Trump is likely to allow the leasing of more federal lands for gas drilling. Biden’s Dept of Interior in 2023 leased only 161,000 acres of federal land, versus an average of 1.2 million acres a year during the Obama and Trump years. The reason is the Bureau of Land Management’s new “conservation and landscape health rule,” which places ecosystem health concerns (i.e. the threatened greater sage grouse and dunes sage lizard) on equal footing with the economic benefits of resource extraction. Of somewhat greater concern to the oil lobby is the Biden EPA’s newly finalized rules governing “fugitive emissions” of natural gas from fields and pipelines. Operators will have to pay $900 per ton of emissions, rising to $1,500 per ton in a few years. And they have to pay to install equipment to monitor those emissions and verify them using third parties. Many gas producers would welcome Trump efforts to soften or scrap the methane rules, which could cost billions of dollars a year in fines for the nation’s biggest emitters. One of those, Houston-based Hilcorp Energy, owned by billionaire Jeffery Hildebrand, recently agreed to a consent decree and $9 million civil penalty with the EPA over natural gas emissions from its San Juan Basin fields in the Four Corners region. Hilcorp teamed with Carlyle Group in 2017 to buy the decades-old San Juan assets for $3 billion. The field emits a lot because it consists of 12,000 gas wells across 2 million acres and hundreds of miles of gas collecting pipelines. Hilcorp promised to cut 113,000 tons of emissions there over 3 years – like taking 24,000 cars off the road. Some gas producers aren’t too concerned by such restrictions, because they have already been working not just to limit leaks, but to capture and permanently sequester carbon emissions. Chris Kalnin, CEO of BKV Energy, which raised $200 million in a 2024 IPO explains that his company has been injecting carbon dioxide underground at its shale fracking operations in north Texas. The work is monitored by gas detectors and third-party certified by American Carbon Registry, which mints non-fungible tokens representing the amounts of carbon sequestered by BKV and published them to the blockchain. This way BKV can sell its customers “decarbonized” gas, at a roughly $5 per thousand cubic feet premium. Alternatively, BKV can turn that gas into lower-carbon electricity at the 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant that BKV acquired in Temple, Texas. “We see multiple ways to win, aligned with megatrends,” says Kalnin. “The greens are on one side and drill, baby, drill is on the other side, and the silent majority is stuck in between,” says Kalnin. BKV (market cap $1.9 billion, $250 million ebitda) initially built up a gas position in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania, then in recent years Kalnin took the unusual tack of buying up assets in the birthplace of shale gas fracking – the Barnett shale field outside Fort Worth, Texas, where wildcatting legend George Mitchell proved out the combo of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In 2020 BKV bought Devon Energy’s fields there for $500 million. And in 2022 it acquired ExxonMobil’s Barnett for $750 million. Kalnin says Exxon hadn’t made any meaningful investments there for years. “The Barnett is alive and well,” he says. And there’s plenty of shale gas left to frack all across the country. “They left huge meat on the bone.”

Title: What Drove The 70% Surge In Barclays Stock This Year?

BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM - OCTOBER 18: The sun shines on the Barclay's logo outside a branch of the ... [+] bank Barclay's on October 18, 2023 in Bristol, England. Barclay's has confirmed that it will close a number of branches due to changing customer habits with virtually all banking transactions now taking place online. The number of people visiting physical branches has fallen dramatically in the last five years, according to the company, with the Covid 19 coronavirus pandemic also contributing to changes to banking habits. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) Barclays stock (NYSE: BCS) has gained about 70% year-to-date, as compared to the 25% rise in the S&P500 over the same period. In contrast, Barclays’ peer Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is up 35% year-to-date. Also see, What’s Happening With HSBC Stock? So what are some of the factors that have driven Barclays’ stock higher of late? Earlier this year, Barclays announced a strategic overhaul aimed at stabilizing its operations and improving profitability. The bank has shifted its focus toward expanding its domestic lending business in the U.K, including mortgage lending and personal loans, which offer greater stability. At the same time, it has been reducing costs in its more volatile investment banking segment. The company also bought Tesco Bank in a deal that was closed in early November in a move that bolsters Barclays’ retail banking presence in the UK. Barclays is also targeting over £2 billion ($2.5 billion) in gross cost savings and aims to improve its Return on Tangible Equity to over 12% by 2026, up from about 9% in 2023. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Barclays posted better-than-expected Q3 results. Net profits attributable to shareholders stood at £1.6 billion (about $2 billion), while Barclays’ revenues for the period rose 5% year-over-year to £6.5 billion. Growth was driven by the company’s investment banking business - which has considerable exposure to the U.S. market - fared well, led by renewed deal making activity as well as higher volatility in the stock markets, which boosted fee revenues. The bank is also seeing higher-than-expected net interest income - essentially the difference between the interest earned on loans and what they pay on deposits. Barclays raised its NII guidance for 2024 to £6.5 billion ($8.16 billion), up from £6.3 billion previously. This improvement is driven by slower-than-expected rate cuts in the UK and structural hedges that the company previously took on to mitigate the impact of falling interest rates. The increase in BCS stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 32% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 6% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We value Barclay’s stock at about $12 per share which is slightly below the current market price. See our analysis of Barclays’ valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate.

Title: From Apple’s record valuation to Zara’s share surge: An A-Z of financial markets in 2024

It was the year that the drawn-out Apple tax case finally came to a conclusion as the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) confirmed that the European Commission had been correct in deciding back in 2016 that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid from Ireland and must pay the State €13 billion in back taxes, plus interest. Outgoing EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who persisted with the case, would tell reporters hours after the final ruling that she had broken down in tears when she learned the outcome. The €14 billion pot, including interest, held in escrow since 2018, took centre stage in the recent general election, featuring in all party manifestos as they pledged to spend the windfall on everything from housing to the green transition. The case had no bearing on Apple’s own share price, however, as it spiralled to new heights, making it the first business to beach the $3.5 trillion (€3.3 trillion) level. Bulmers ciders’ parent C&C was rattled in June when the drinks group restated three years of its earnings due to accounting errors, resulting in the company taking an underlying charge of €5 million and parting way with its chief executive of just over a year. C&C subsequently said that it will pay a €1.3 million settlement to the former CEO, Patrick McMahon. He had succeeded David Forde, who quit in May 2023 after the group incurred a one-off charge of €25 million related to the delayed implementation of a new business management system at one of its UK units. Corre Energy, the second-last company to float on the Irish stock market, in 2021, plunged 95 per cent this year as the storage developer for renewable energy required two emergency cash injections from large shareholders as it searched for a long-term investor and saw members of its original board, including its founders, depart. The Irish-run but Dutch-based company said in October that it was now prioritising capital expenditure on two projects in Germany, with the first of these on track for a final investment decision in 2026, after its previously most advanced project in the Netherlands encountered permit challenges. DCC, the Dublin-based but London-listed distribution and services conglomerate founded in 1976 by businessman Jim Flavin, moved to abandon its conglomerate roots in November as it set out on a path to sell its healthcare and technology units to focus on its fast-growing energy division. It follows the disposals over the past decade of DCC’s food and beverage assets, including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brand, the frozen and chilled foods logistics business, and recycling and waste management arm. Analysts estimate the healthcare and technology units could fetch a total of more than £3 billion (€3.63 billion), with the cash generated set to be returned to investors, most likely by way of share buy-backs. CEO Donal Murphy is hoping the narrowing of DCC’s focus will turn investors’ attention to how its energy division, which still earns most of its money selling fossil fuels to households, is increasingly targeting the green energy transition. The European Central Bank (ECB) and other big central banks remained centre stage during 2024 as they began to reduce interest rates following a series of hikes in recent years in a war against inflation. The ECB cut its key deposit rate a total of one percentage point spread across four quarter-point reductions since June. The rate-setting body for the euro zone expects inflation across the region to be back at its 2 per cent target next year, down from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2023. Wall Street in New York lured more Iseq heavyweights this year, with Flutter Entertainment, parent of Paddy Power and Betfair, delisting from Euronext Dublin, the Irish Stock Exchange operator, in January. It was followed in July by Smurfit Kappa, which moved its main quotation to the US on completion of its merger with cardboard box-making rival Westrock to form Smurfit Westrock. CRH had quit the Irish market in late 2023. Greencore more than doubled in value in 2024 following a tumultuous eight years, as its CEO of two years, Dalton Philips, steered a recovery for the maker of sandwiches to ready-made Italian meals for big supermarkets. In the process, Philips backed out of low-yielding contracts and leaned into trends such as the “joy of missing out” to push dine-in meal kits to those happy to forgo going out. Greencore’s earnings for the year to September topped the company’s own guidance, even after it had raised its forecasts three times during the period. Philips also signalled that the group is preparing to get back out on the acquisitions trail for the first time in years. Harland & Wolff, the Belfast-based shipbuilder that produced the Titanic, collapsed into administration in September, with insolvency practitioners at Teneo assigned to oversee the process, after it failed to find new funding to stay afloat. The company’s AIM-listed shares in London were suspended in August and ultimately delisted in October. The administrators entered exclusive talks the same month to sell the business to Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navartia. A deal was agreed before Christmas. Ires Reit, the Republic’s largest private residential landlord, reached a truce with activist investor Vision Capital in April by offering two board seats to nominees of the Canadian firm as the group continued a strategic review into its options as the share price remained under pressure. Ires hired property industry veteran Eddie Byrne as its CEO that same month, succeeding Margaret Sweeney. The board concluded in August that a substantive sale of the group or its assets – which Vision had been seeking – was not in Ires’s best interests, though it committed to a “capital recycling programme”, selling off noncore apartment assets to unlock some value for investors. The outcome has yet to excite stock market investors. Ires’s shares fell over 17 per cent this year. Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) shares were in the doldrums this year as the US pharma and medtech giant continued to add to a settlement offer aimed at ending thousands of ovarian cancer lawsuits linked to its talcum powder. J&J moved in September to wrap the $9 billion (€8.54 billion) settlement in a pre-packaged chapter 11 bankruptcy of a unit, called Red River Talc, in Texas. A federal judge will decide on the validity of this route – which would end almost all cases – early next year. Kingspan was in focus in September as a long-awaited final UK report on the Grenfell tower disaster in London. The company’s Kooltherm K15 insulation board had been used for 5 per cent of the insulation behind the building’s cladding. The Cavan-based group didn’t know that its product had been used in the development and the report found that insulation was not the main cause of the fire that claimed the lives of 72 people. However, the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was scathing of the group for falsely claiming that a form of K15 had successfully passed fire tests that allowed it to be used on the external walls of high-rise buildings in the first place. It “knowingly created a false market” for the insulation, he said. Luxury goods groups from LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy and Kehring, owner of brands including Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, to Swatch, whose watch brands span Omega to Longines, saw their shares slide this year amid uncertainty around demand out of the key Chinse and Japanese markets. Management consulting firm Bain & Company estimates that global sales of personal luxury goods will fall 2 per cent this year, with economic uncertainty shrinking the industry’s customer base. It reckons China, which had seen a sustained boom for years amid a growing middle class, is on track for a 22 per cent sales slump in 2024. CRH selected chief financial officer Jim Mintern to succeed Albert Manifold, who had pursued record levels of deal-making over the past 11 years to move the traditional seller of cement and other base materials into full-scale construction services, as of the end of 2024. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€12.5 million) last year and CRH said in its latest annual report that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align” with practices in the US, where it moved its main stock market listing last year. Nvidia, the undisputed darling of Wall Street as the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, saw its shares soar over 190 per cent over the course of 2024 – pushing its market value to $3.43 trillion (€3.3 trillion) – as it continued to deliver blowout earnings. Its stock rose at a multiple of the pace of the other members of the so-called magnificent seven, which also include Facebook’s parent, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon. Japanese camera giant Olympus was in focus for all the wrong reasons in October when its German CEO, Stefan Kaufmann, was booted out amid allegations of the purchase of illegal drugs. Kaufman, who had joined a European unit of Olympus 21 years ago, was subsequently indicted by prosecutors, suspected of having taken possession of cocaine and the synthetic drug MDMA multiple times in Tokyo in 2023. Irish financier Paul Coulson’s Ardagh saw its riskiest bonds trade at below 20 cent on the euro during 2024 as investors became increasingly concerned about the glass and metal containers group’s $12.4 billion (€11.7 billion) debt pile – especially as the outlook for its glass bottles unit continued to weaken. The multinational glass and metal containers manufacturer for the drinks industry, built up by Coulson over the past 25 years, continues to weigh how to reduce its borrowings. The price at which its most-junior – or subordinated – bonds have been trading indicates that holders of these notes expect they will have to write off much of what they are owed as part of restructuring. Coulson owns about 36 per cent of the business, which traces its roots back to the now long-defunct Irish Glass Bottle Company. CEO quitting and firings hit record levels globally in 2024, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the international firm that assists “transitioning” executives find new roles. Big CEO exits include Laxman Narasimhan from Starbucks, who was ousted by his board in August after 17 months, Mark Schneider at Nestlé, Dennis Muilenburg at Boeing, Pat Gelsinger at Intel and Carlos Tavares at Stellantis, the car-making group whose brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep. Reddit, the Californian social media company, made its long-anticipated stock market flotation on the Nasdaq in March in a deal that valued the business at $8.87 billion (€8.4 billion). The 19-year old company, popular for its member-led communities known as subreddits that span interest areas from world news to brain-rot memes, has seen its share price soar about 250 per cent since, helped by the posting its first-ever profit in the third quarter of this year, as a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature that translates English posts into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German drove user numbers higher. Sterling became the surprise best-performing currency among those by G10 (group of 10 industrialised nations), following years of volatility that has seen it dubbed the British lira among other names, according to the Wall Street Journal. The pound rose as much as 5.2 per cent against the euro alone, as the Labour Party’s election victory in June lifted a lot of political uncertainty and the Bank of England trailed other big central banks in cutting interest rates. Still, that was nothing on the performance of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which soared as much as 150 per cent – turbocharged in November by Donald Trump’s re-election as US president. The Republican has vowed to make the US the “crypto capital” of the world. Elon Musk’s Tesla soared 29 per cent in the week of the Trump victory, pushing it above the $1 trillion (€950 billion) valuation mark amid hopes the president-elect’s highest-profile promoter on the campaign trail (who contributed more than $130 million to the cause) will see his companies get favourable treatment from the incoming administration. Still, China’s BYD overtook Tesla late last year as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles with its more affordable range. It also sped past Tesla in terms of overall revenues in the third quarter for the first time, helped by hybrid sales as well as battery-powered vehicles. Italy’s second-largest bank, Unicredit, ruffled political and labour union feathers in Germany in September when it swooped in to snap up a 21 per cent stake in Frankfurt-based Commerzbank with a view to launching a takeover bid. While chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a big proponent of an EU banking union, he denounced the Italian manoeuvre as “an unfriendly attack”. Unicredit has since launched a €10 billion bid for domestic rival Banco BPM – and its CEO, Andrea Orcel, has indicated he is unlikely to make a move on Commerzbank at least until German elections are done and dusted in February following the unrelated collapse of Scholz’s government. Still, he has since upped the Commerzbank stake to 28 per cent. Irish banker David Duffy led Virgin Money to a £2.9 billion (€3.5 billion) sale to fellow UK lender Nationwide Building Society at the end of September to create the second-largest mortgages and savings business in that market. The former AIB chief executive quit the Irish bank in 2015 for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), then a subsidiary of National Australia Bank. He led CYBG through an IPO in early 2016 and into a merger two years later with Virgin Money. Duffy stepped down as Virgin’s CEO as the Nationwide tie-up was completed and is estimated to have secured a pay-day worth as much as £15.3 million (€18.3 million) through the sale of shares and stock options he held in the bank. Walt Disney defeated a challenge to its board in April from activist investor and Brooklyn Beckham’s father-in-law, Nelson Peltz, handing a victory to CEO Bob Iger and ending one of the most expensive boardroom battles in history. The stock has rallied strongly in the past few months after the company reported better-than-expected results for its financial year to September, boosted by its streaming business and issued a rosier outlook than followers of the company had been used to in recent times. French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel set out on a path towards full ownership of Eir, as two US hedge funds began to exit their investment in the former Irish telecoms monopoly, in which debt market investors hold €1.35 billion of bonds. Firms belonging to Niel acquired 64.5 per cent of Eir in April 2018 in a deal that saw two of the company’s largest pre-existing investors, hedge funds run by New York firms Anchorage Capital and Davidson Kempner, roll most of their shares into a combined 35.5 per cent interest. It is understood that Davidson Kempner sold its 8.9 per cent holding in the business over the summer to Anchorage Capital. Anchorage began to gradually sell down the combined stake by participating in a share buyback by a holding company above Eir in October. Neil’s stake currently stands at about 69 per cent. The market interest rate – or yield – on French 10-year government debt rose above those of crisis-scarred Greece for the first time in late November as Michel Barnier’s government limped towards collapse after he controversially used special powers to force through his budget without a vote. Marine Le Pen’s far-right grouping and the left-wing New Popular Front united in early December to force through a no-confidence motion in the former Brexit negotiator’s government. Greece, which emerged from a third international bailout in 2018, saw its creditworthiness upgraded to investment grade in late 2023 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, following 13 years of junk status. Its economy has grown faster than the EU average over the past five years, its government is rapidly reprivatising banks that were rescued during the crisis and it is repaying chunks of its bailout loans ahead of schedule. Zara owner, Inditex’s shares soared as much as 45 per cent in 2024, twice the pace of the wider European retail sector as its popular fashion ranges and nimble operations helped it cope better than some of its rivals with changing consumer demands. The group, which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear brands, has been quicker to adapt to fashion trends and potential headwinds than some of its rivals, thanks to its tightly managed supply chain, according to analysts. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Inditex’s ambitious expansion plans in the US, its second-largest market by sales, where it opened its first Zara store in 1989 and where its Massimo Dutti brand has made a tentative return recently after a previous foray into market failed. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Mopping up the messy entrails of 2024 isn’t a straightforward job. What kind of year was that anyway? For much of the business world, it felt like a wait-and-see period – a damp purgatory for some, a cushioned holding pattern of a year for others. Plenty enjoyed a 2024 that was somewhere between reasonable and decent, if not the definitive bounce-back they had hoped for in January. Some started the year in positions of strength and went on to manifest more success than ever. Some, channelling corporation tax receipts, were worryingly buoyant. But within industries wracked by inflation, cost-of-living pressures and/or retreating rates of investment, “survive ‘til 25″ became the quiet catchphrase. Some ran out of money, then ran out of time. Some just wilted. Others swam in a sea of setbacks, gasping through another quarter, another season. Dispiritingly, those for whom the year could have been better included much of the hospitality industry. More than 600 restaurants, cafes and food businesses closed, according to the Restaurants Association of Ireland industry lobby group, as swollen costs and the legacy of pandemic debt overwhelmed them. In August, there was shock among restaurateurs as celebrated chef Dylan McGrath shut down two restaurants, Brasserie Sixty6 and Rustic Stone, warning that hospitality in Dublin was “simply not sustainable”. Other big names joined in the retrenchment: October saw Shanahan’s on the Green close for the foreseeable, while Dillinger’s in Ranelagh said goodbye to customers after a 15-year “wild ride”. For Press Up, the fast scaled-up group founded by schoolfriends Paddy McKillen jnr (son of the property developer) and Matt Ryan, there was something even more unpalatable on the menu: a reckoning. In September, London-based lender Cheyne Capital took control of the group in a debt-for-equity swap that aims to solidify its financials. One Wowburger and three Wagamama restaurants in Dublin were shuttered and though it later opened Asian restaurant Kaldero in the former Wagamamas outlet on South King Street, it was still a glum autumn for a group that had previously seemed immune from the woes of the sector. Not far away, a retailer at the heart of Dublin since the 1970s was counting the cost of changed fashions: Alias Tom, which in its time had clothed U2, Westlife and the business and political elite, went into liquidation, citing “the move toward less formal workwear”. Founded in 1976 by Tom Kennedy, Alias Tom once had exclusivity on brands such as Prada, Hugo Boss and Gucci. But in 2024, the “only realistic option” left for the company – 10 per cent of which was still owned by Kennedy – was to wind up. Dublin stockbrokers were part of the Alias Tom clientele at one point, but Dublin stockbrokers are now themselves a lesser spotted breed. As for the Irish Stock Exchange, which has traded as Euronext Dublin since 2018, this wasn’t a vintage year. In July, packaging group Smurfit Kappa, as it was then known, completed a hat-trick of heavyweight exits that started in 2023 with CRH and continued in January with Flutter Entertainment. Mention of the 231-year-old exchange in the budget speech of the somewhat younger Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers, reflected the extent to which a halving of companies on the Iseq All-Share index since 2018 was perceived to have become an Ireland Inc problem, not merely a Euronext one. It hasn’t helped that HealthBeacon and Corre Energy, two of the only three companies to take initial public offerings (IPOs) in Dublin over the past five years, have not had a tremendous time of it. By January, cash-burning medical technology company HealthBeacon had progressed from “embattled” status to officially in need of rescue. One arrived courtesy of US-based kitchen appliance maker Hamilton Beach Brands, but the company consequentially delisted. Corre Energy, for its part, spent most of 2024 watching its share price plunge. There was little else to do. The company develops underground storage facilities for renewable energy, but permit challenges have pushed back a crucial final investment decision on its key Zuidwending (ZW1) compressed air energy storage project in the Netherlands until after 2027. Back in February, co-founder Darren Patrick-Green exited his president and executive director roles after an unrelated business he owned was linked by UK revenue officials to a tax avoidance scheme. In November, with Corre still desperately seeking a strategic investor, chief executive Keith McGrane stepped down. A search for new executive energy began. The relief at the start of the year was that there appeared to be no sequel to “tech winter”, the job-shedding phenomenon of 2022-23 that had seen just about every technology company in town announce at least one round of redundancies. But 2024 ended on a bum note for the indigenous sector after the Government opted not to extend the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) accelerator programme – which trains, mentors and invests in start-ups – beyond its November 2025 end date. It was open-letter time. [ The Irish Times view on the National Digital Research Centre: ending State funding is short-sightedOpens in new window ] More than 200 tech founders warned that if the Government didn’t reverse the decision, which they blasted as “disconnected from reality”, it would stymie future innovation and economic resilience. Alas, a general election had already been called by this point and no one was paying much attention. Michael O’Leary, an early election headline-maker, more often than not appears in the winners’ section of this annual review. The longest-serving chief executive of any large airline doesn’t really have bad years, not relative to everyone else. The short-haul king doesn’t even have to crack a joke for a roomful of Fine Gael supporters to collapse with laughter because they think he has. Alas, one of the key tasks to befall him in 2024 was to wait for multi-troubled Boeing to pony up the planes it owes his airline, and for that reason alone it can’t have been a hilarious year. The new executives in charge of the US manufacturer “continue to disappoint”, O’Leary was heard lamenting in summer. By October, he seemed resigned to the likelihood of having to “walk back our traffic growth” as a result of delivery delays he summed up in characteristic style as a “pain in the backside”. To the election, then. Losing slowly in count centres is a common fate, but presumably no less deflating for that. Caught up in a comprehensive greenlash, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media Catherine Martin was second only to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the high-profile casualties list. Martin, who will be missed by an arts community she supported better than most, came under Oireachtas committee-grilling pressure in the spring after she appeared to stir up tensions from nowhere with then RTÉ chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh over the precise nature of the information conveyed to her about the procedures followed when RTÉ reached an exit agreement with former RTÉ finance chief Richard Collins. RTÉ hadn’t done anything wrong this time, but the organisation-reforming Ní Raghallaigh, baffled by the Minister’s arcane complaint, felt forced to resign, and later echoed Martin’s critics in the Opposition by accusing her of “taking a hands-off approach” to its various crises. It seemed there was also nothing any Minister could do, meanwhile, about airport operator DAA’s strange obligation – thanks to a 32 million passenger cap mandated by planning laws – to actually suppress passenger numbers at Dublin Airport. In August, the airport had the busiest month in its history. A good return on investment for the public money that is annually poured into promoting Ireland to potential overseas visitors? DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs, frustrated by the uncertainty and branding the cap “not the best look for Ireland”, was not the only one wishing it was that simple. As the year neared its close, one Irish export was confirmed as a toxic brand. Conor McGregor’s earning power unravelled at pace after a High Court jury upheld Nikita Hand’s civil claim that she was raped by the mixed martial arts fighter in a Dublin hotel. IO Interactive, the Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, was the first to “cease its collaboration”. Then, one by one, every retailer that had previously been keen to sell McGregor’s Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey destocked them. Proximo Spirits – the company to which McGregor sold his whiskey in 2021 – valiantly announced it would stop using his name and likeness in its marketing in a bid to save its acquisition. But with even the paraffin wax version of McGregor at the National Wax Museum taken out of circulation, the taint by association was unmistakable. Let’s swiftly segue now to some bona fide winners via the spectre of Donald Trump, a man who showed us all in 2024 that being a judge-confirmed rapist is no barrier to becoming US president. Trump’s election victory threatens to make losers of vast tracts of the planet, if not the planet itself – a cheery thought to dwell on when Jools Holland’s Rhythm & Blues Orchestra breaks into its traditional Hootenanny rendition of Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think). But if the world ends in 2025, at least some people can say they went out on a high. Those highs were literal for Aer Lingus pilots. By late July, they were back in the air after a two-week work-to-rule period plus an eight-hour strike. Holding firm in the face of “management intransigence” meant they pocketed a 17.75 per cent pay increase – following a Labour Court recommendation – rather than the 12.25 per cent originally offered. They also won a boost to their allowances and swerved the rostering concessions sought by the IAG-owned airline. Along the way, the travel plans of 90,000 passengers were disrupted while, as the dispute hit the headlines, social media users were quick to spy a certain resemblance between Capt Mark Tighe, president of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association, and one Captain Birdseye. He won’t have cared. For the pilots, the outcome was, he said, “the greatest pay award seen in 30 years”. After seeing his stock plummet within international tech circles in 2023, Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave ascended once again this year to cruising altitude. He was back as chief executive of the events group, having served a six-month hiatus to placate the tech luminaries who found his stance on Israel – that “war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies” – controversial. Some of them, including Meta and IBM, returned to sponsor this year’s event in Lisbon at which a more muted Cosgrave avoided any further turbulence. A memorable main character of another kind was at the centre of the film Poor Things, in which Emma Stone played an adult woman implanted with a baby’s brain, bringing home four Oscars and a box office take of $117 million (€110 million). [ Poor Things review: Emma Stone is properly unsettling in this provocative feminist fable drenched in Victorian horrorOpens in new window ] This was heartening for fans of unsettling, offbeat fantasy cinema. But it was even more rewarding for Element Pictures, the prolific Dublin production company led by Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe, with the total of 11 Oscar nominations garnered by Poor Things setting a new record for the most ever secured by an Irish-produced film. Another home-grown company generating joy was Smyth’s Toys. Accounts filed later in 2024 showed the retailer’s combined pretax profits across the regions in which it operates hit €54.6 million in 2023. That’s a lot of Lego. Indeed, with its businesses in the Republic and Northern Ireland now representing just 14 per cent of its total revenues, the Mayo brothers behind Smyth’s Toys have made expansion across Europe look like child’s play. Also doing well overseas was Co Tyrone’s Sarah Friar, the former chief executive of neighbourhood social networking service Nextdoor, who in June joined artificial intelligence hype-lodestone OpenAI as its chief financial officer, working alongside Sam “superintelligence” Altman. Another appointment of note came in December when Trump nominated Dublin-born Gail Slater as assistant attorney general at the US department of justice’s antitrust division. “Together, we will Make America Competitive Again!” the president-elect posted on Truth Social. Making America Healthy Again, genuinely, were the EY Entrepreneur(s) of the Year: Sharon Cunningham and Orlaith Ryan, the chief executive and chief technology officer respectively of Clonmel-headquartered Shorla Oncology. Their company, which raised $45 million this year, counts four US Food and Drug Administration-approved products within a growing portfolio of accessible, life-saving treatments for patients with rare, orphan and paediatric cancers. At the ceremony, Ryan described the award as “validation” for the Shorla team’s years of hard work. But whatever happened to those erstwhile Iseq stalwarts after they upped sticks from the Dublin stock market? It was onwards and upwards for Tony Smurfit as he moved seamlessly from his role as boss of cardboard box-making giant Smurfit Kappa to the new position of group chief executive of packaging mega-giant Smurfit Westrock. This followed July’s formal seal on the Irish company’s deal to merge with US peer WestRock. Smurfit Westrock, which has its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, reported a net loss for its first quarter as a merged group, booking $500 million (€461 million) of expenses and accounting adjustments related to the transaction. But its earnings otherwise pointed to “a strong foundation to build upon”, said a confident Smurfit. True, not every athlete at Paris 2024 was a huge fan of the sustainable cardboard beds the company supplied to the Olympic Village. The good news, however, is that these have now been recycled into “the equivalent of 1.5 million wine boxes”. Cheers! Cement-maker CRH, for a long time the largest stock on the Iseq, found itself enjoying New York life. In the 12 months after it relocated its main listing to Wall Street, its share price swelled 60 per cent. By autumn, it seemed not even bad weather could leave much of an imprint on its performance. It will be all change for the company in 2025, with acquisition-loving chief executive Albert Manifold set to be succeeded in the top job by his finance chief, Jim Mintern. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€11.9 million) last year, hanging on to his title as the highest paid boss of an Irish plc, but Mintern could be in line for an even bigger bonanza, with the company indicating that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align with US practices”. Insert dollar signs here. Will gambling company Flutter Entertainment have a ka-ching of a 2025? You wouldn’t bet against it. The owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, led by chief executive Peter Jackson, recently snapped up Italy’s Snaitech and a 56 per cent stake in Brazil’s Betnacional operator NSX Group – deals that give Flutter top three positions in most of the world’s regulated gambling markets. National Football League (NFL) results didn’t quite go the way of its US brand FanDuel in October, but you can’t win them all – not in the short term. Over the medium term, as more US states legalise sports betting, FanDuel and Flutter remain poised to cash in. There were comebacks of sorts this year for two Irishmen who both resigned from their previous roles after different forms of misconduct. Declan Kelly – who quit his global public relations firm Teneo in 2021 after accusations of drunken misbehaviour at a charity concert – spent 2024 signing up sports stars and business names for his new-ish advisory vehicle Consello, which expanded its operations into Ireland. As for former BP chief executive Bernard Looney, he was “wishing BP well”, he said, as joined the board of US data centre company Prometheus Hyperscale a year after he was obliged to resign from the oil giant for failing to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Having spent 32 years at BP, Looney (54) told the Financial Times he was “thinking about the next 32 years” of his career. Same, Bernard, same. It may take almost that long to assess the full ramifications of the creeping change and dramatic power swings we witnessed and endured in 2024. But for now, with the tendrils of Christmas already starting to unwrap, the only thing left to do is to wish everyone who deserves them many sustainably profitable returns in 2025 – and everyone who doesn’t, none. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Valve makes more money per employee than Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix combined

The big picture: Valve is one of the most important and influential companies in the PC gaming market. It's also one of the most unique due to its private nature and unusually small workforce relative to its impact and competitors. A recent analysis of data uncovered through an ongoing lawsuit against the company highlights how Valve starkly contrasts with the world's biggest tech giants. A Valve employee recently provided PC Gamer with a rough calculation of the company's per-employee income, revealing that Valve generates more money per person than several of the world's largest companies. While the data is a few years old and doesn't account for some significant recent trends in the tech sector, Valve's ranking in this metric likely hasn't shifted much over that time. Exact figures for Valve's per-hour and per-employee net income remain redacted. However, a chart from 2018 confirms that Valve's per-employee income exceeded that of companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Intel, and Amazon. Click to enlarge Facebook's second-place ranking of $780,400 per employee – or $89 per hour – likely stands far ahead of competitors such as Apple and Microsoft because Facebook employs just under 70,000 employees compared to the two PC giants, which each have workforces over twice that number. By contrast, Amazon, with a headcount of over 1.5 million, earned only around $15,892 per employee, or $1.81 per hour. Filings from a 2021 antitrust lawsuit brought by Wolfire Games revealed that Valve employed just 336 people at the time – fewer than the development team for Baldur's Gate 3. Despite this relatively tiny workforce, Valve oversees Steam, which hosts nearly 40 million daily users and dominates the PC game sales market. Wolfire cited this discrepancy as evidence that Steam's 30 percent revenue commission for most titles is unjustified. Notably, the available data doesn't reflect the impact of the Steam Deck, Valve's handheld gaming PC, which launched in 2022. It's unclear to what extent Valve hired or outsourced additional staff for the device's development and production, but it's unlikely the company expanded its workforce anywhere near the scale of other tech giants. Valve would likely remain at the top of a per-employee income ranking based on current data. However, recent trends such as widespread layoffs and the ongoing AI boom could shift the standings for other companies. It would also be intriguing to see whether Nvidia has entered the ranking, as the AI explosion has propelled its profits to new heights, recently making it the newest member of the $3 trillion club.

Title: The era of big bets on EV plants in Canada is over - it’s time for consolidation, minister says

Full Content:
Industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector.Tara Walton/The Canadian Press The era of Canada putting down big bets on massive new electric-vehicle battery plants is coming to end. As Industry Minister, François-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen Stellantis N.V., STLA-N Volkswagen Group and Honda Motor Co. HNDAF commit to new factories in Ontario that represent some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector. A few months ago, Mr. Champagne was still talking up the possibility of landing one or two more such commitments from global automakers. But in a year-end interview with The Globe and Mail, he acknowledged he’s no longer big-game hunting the same way. Instead, the focus has shifted to solidifying the existing commitments during a turbulent period for the nascent EV sector, and leveraging them to grow out the domestic supply chain that they are meant to anchor. “Now, it’s about consolidation,” Mr. Champagne said, referring in particular to landing and advancing investments in mining and refining battery materials such as lithium, graphite and nickel. Repeatedly invoking a new mantra about the need to achieve greater “speed and scale,” he was tacitly acknowledging that Canada needs to dramatically pick up the pace for the battery plants to be supplied primarily by the country’s ample reserves of critical minerals – access to which was one of the main reasons cited by the automakers for placing the investments here. Mr. Champagne also reflected on how Ottawa’s EV-battery strategy has played out to date, defending the government’s billions of dollars in subsidies, in the face of mounting skepticism resulting from setbacks in the auto sector’s transition to EVs, as it has struggled with slower demand growth than expected. While that bumpiness has not derailed the three landmark battery plants in Ontario, it has jeopardized a fourth planned by Sweden’s struggling Northvolt AB, and seen other retreats such as Ford Motor Co. F-N putting off plans to assemble EVs at its facilities in Oakville, Ont. Quebec says Northvolt battery project will go ahead as company cuts 20% of global staff How much longer Mr. Champagne will be the point-person for the strategy is an open question, given that a federal election early in 2025 appears increasingly likely, and the governing party that he serves faces a double-digit deficit in opinion polls. But his perspective may be useful context for whoever is in office by the end of 2025, and tasked with deciding whether and how to double down on trying to turn Canada into a force in EV-making. One of his arguments is that subsidies for the battery plants will not be nearly as high as most people perceive – particularly when it comes to Stellantis and Volkswagen, which most media reports have suggested will top $28-billion in combined support from the federal and Ontario governments. (The Honda deal has a lower ceiling and is structured differently.) That figure is essentially the maximum total possible, contingent on the plants operating at full capacity from the earliest possible date, because it’s mostly derived from production subsidies per battery made that expire in the early 2030s. An arguable upside of the EV demand-growth slowdown, to which Mr. Champagne implicitly pointed, is that the cost for taxpayers will be lower because the factories – expected to be operational for decades – won’t need to ramp up as quickly. “People have this impression that we have dispersed that money,” he said. “But today, I’ve landed tens of billions of investments, and I’ve only dispersed a few hundred million.” He was somewhat more philosophical on the more negative consequences of the industry’s recent struggles, including for Canada’s large industry of parts-makers and other suppliers at the mercy of automakers’ rapidly shifting timelines for EV roll-outs – framing it as inevitable during a revolutionary industrial change. “If you look at the history of the world, when you have a shift in technology for the next century, the first few years are always bumpy,” he said. “My role, and the role of the industry, is not only to look at next week or next month or next year, but to position Canada for long-term success.” He also suggested that in the near-term, Canada is well-positioned to weather uncertainty around the pace of the shift away from internal combustion engines, because Ontario still has several assembly plants making vehicles with those gas-fuelled motors for the foreseeable future, as well as some (notably Stellantis’s Windsor assembly plant) building flexible platforms that can make both types of vehicles. In a possible nod to current political dynamics in the United States – where most Canadian-made vehicles are sold, and where president-elect Donald Trump’s EV skepticism may or may not be counterbalanced by Elon Musk’s role in his administration – Mr. Champagne repeatedly invoked Tesla Inc. as evidence of the need for patience. He did so on the premises that Tesla had plenty of highs and lows before establishing dominance of the early EV space, and that Tesla’s soaring stock price shows that investors retain faith in EVs ultimately taking over the market. Otherwise, he mostly steered away from commenting on the extent to which Mr. Trump’s threat to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian exports could hurt all forms of vehicle-making here, other than to express optimism that Mr. Trump’s sensitivity to markets – which could react negatively to massive disruptions of the highly integrated Canada-U.S. supply chain – will help dissuade him. Actually strengthening that supply chain in the coming years is partly contingent on the natural-resource question – whether Canada can kick-start its mining sector enough to supply not just domestic facilities but also U.S. ones, as industries seek to reduce reliance on China – which contributes to the government’s focus shifting upstream. Mr. Champagne touted a few examples of progress over the past couple of years – particularly at the mid-stream level, such as plans for Canada’s first copper-foil factory and a joint venture by General Motors Co. and Posco Chemical Co. Ltd. to produce cathode active materials, both in Quebec. He also noted the multifaceted nature of Honda’s investment in Ontario, which includes partnerships with Posco and with Asahi Kasei Corp. to make battery components. That could carry extra weight since Honda’s recently announced plan to merge with Nissan Motor Corp. to create the world’s third-largest automaker, which is widely seen as an effort to keep pace with Chinese competitors. And Honda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe hinted to The Globe earlier this year that his company is interested in further investing in this country’s natural resources. But while the effort to get more critical minerals to market does not rest entirely with whoever sits in his chair in cabinet – and is contingent on factors ranging from the federal Natural Resources ministry’s efforts to work with provinces to speed up permitting, to infrastructure investments, to the Finance Ministry’s implementation of mining tax incentives – it now requires the sort of entrepreneurial hustle Mr. Champagne brought to landing the battery plants. He acknowledged that it might have seemed more obvious to start upstream and then move downstream. The economic case for subsidizing the battery plants always rested partly on the establishment of a reliable market for Canadian resources, so it’s a significant hitch that Canada is not yet fully prepared to supply them. But Mr. Champagne contended that there was a narrow window during which the automakers were deciding where to situate the battery plants – which has now almost closed, with most such North American commitments already made – and he had to seize it. The alternative, he suggested, would have been to effectively give up on Canada’s long history of making cars and trucks, which was a real prospect a few years ago as a decades-long decline threatened to be worsened by being left behind in the EV shift. “One of the first briefings I got from officials was basically that [I would be] presiding over the end of the auto sector in Canada gradually,” he said. “And we turned what was a challenge into an opportunity.” Whether Canada’s efforts to position itself as a major player in the electrification of transportation hold up as a win in the long-run, though, will depend on the success of its next phase working backward to build a supply chain – whoever is steering it.

Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and Chairman of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), executed significant stock transactions on December 23, 2024. According to a recent SEC filing, Zuckerberg sold Class A Common Stock through CZI Holdings, LLC and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation, accumulating a total sale value of approximately $21.5 million.

In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has been the subject of notable developments. RBC Capital maintained its Outperform rating on the company and increased its price target to $700, reflecting a potential for 15-20%+ earnings growth. This increase comes as Meta continues to emphasize artificial intelligence (AI) investments to enhance user engagement and solidify its market presence. Canaccord Genuity also maintained a positive stance on Meta, raising the company's price target from $700 to $730. This adjustment recognizes the company's growth prospects, especially in ad creative generation and business messaging. In addition, Emarketer's estimates predict that Instagram, a Meta property, will constitute half of Meta's advertising revenue in the U.S. by 2025. This projection emphasizes Instagram's importance as a central revenue generator for the company. However, the company faced a setback when the Irish data protection commission imposed a $264 million fine on Meta's Irish subsidiary over a data breach affecting 29 million users worldwide. Lastly, analysts from Truist Securities expressed a positive outlook on Meta's prospects for 2025, anticipating larger companies like Meta to outperform smaller firms. These are recent developments, presenting a snapshot of the dynamic environment in which Meta operates. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Hits New Highs with $30.1B in Semiconductor Revenue – What’s Fueling the Surge?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other top performing dividend stocks in 2024. Over time, dividend stocks have shown consistent resilience in difficult market conditions. Despite the recent focus on AI, the long-term appeal of these stocks has grown. Income investors have noticed this shift, reflected in the increasing role of dividends in personal income. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, emphasizing the importance of dividends as a key income source. The report also noted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than a third of total equity returns in the broader market, with the rest coming from capital gains. The dividend growth strategy seems to be working for long-term investors as these stocks have generated strong returns over the years. Considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree highlighted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%, which is over 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that dividends have only decreased in six years during the past 64 years, and only once by more than 5%. In comparison, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as dividend cash flows, as short-term price movements are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by the stability of cash flows. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income This year, dividend stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has gained only 6% year-to-date, while the market has surged by over 27%. Although this might seem discouraging for dividend investors, seasoned investors recognize that this presents a great opportunity to buy dividend stocks. Chris O’Keefe, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, pointed out that the widening performance gap between the market and dividend stocks in 2024 creates an ideal time for investors to consider these equities. Along with O'Keefe, many analysts are encouraging investors to focus on dividend stocks due to their favorable outlook. The Dividend Aristocrats index has struggled to keep pace with the market since 2020. Dividend stocks saw a brief resurgence in 2022 as recession concerns led investors to seek out stable sectors like utilities and consumer goods, but the recovery was short-lived. By 2023, rising interest rates made bond and money-market returns more attractive than dividend yields, causing companies to adopt a more cautious stance and conserve cash amid economic uncertainty. This year, many of the top-performing stocks from the COVID era have once again driven the market to new highs. Despite underperforming for the past two consecutive years, analysts remain optimistic about dividend stocks. They believe that dividend-paying equities could see a resurgence in 2025, as investors are increasingly seeking cash returns. The broader market’s dividend yield recently dropped to a 20-year low, falling below 1.19%, significantly lower than the long-term historical average of 4.3%. With interest rates rising on risk-free investments like Treasuries, companies are recognizing the growing competition for yield. As a result, many are responding by increasing dividends or introducing them for the first time. Notably, several major technology companies began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market that they are positioning themselves as value plays within a high-growth sector. A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. For this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in 2024 so far. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with the highest year-to-date (YTD) as of December 25. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their YTD gains. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Year-to-Date Return as of December 25: 120.82% An American multinational semiconductor company, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks second on our list of the best performing stocks that pay dividends. The company offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. It recently announced its Q4 2024 earnings and reported revenue of $14.05 billion, which showed a significant growth of over 51% from the same period last year. Semiconductor revenue reached a record $30.1 billion, fueled by $12.2 billion in AI revenue. The AI revenue, which grew 220% year-over-year, was driven by the company's leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. In fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased by 37% compared to the previous year, reaching a record $31.9 billion. Though Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has not provided full-year guidance, analysts anticipate the company's revenue will grow by nearly 19% in the current fiscal year, reaching $61.1 billion. Moreover, the semiconductor specialist is expected to see a 15% increase in revenue over the next couple of fiscal years as well. In addition to its strong earnings, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also showed a solid cash position. During the quarter, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $5.6 billion, and its free cash flow came in at $5.48 billion. This cash flow represented 39% of the company's revenue. Due to its growing cash flow, it announced an 11.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.59 per share on December 12. This marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of December 25, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.98%. As of the end of Q3 2024, 128 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database held stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared with 130 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $14.5 billion. With more than 23.4 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the best performing dividend stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Slower AI spending could ignite a 'vicious' downturn for chipmakers, Nvidia supplier says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-spending-investment-data-centers-semiconductors-chip-stocks-ai-phone-2024-12

Semiconductor companies will suffer if Big Tech's spending on data centers slows, the head of the largest provider of chip-testing equipment told the Financial Times. Artificial intelligence-linked smartphones could save the day, he added. According to Advantest CEO Doug Lefever, the downswing wouldn't have to last long to have a pronounced effect on the industry. Given the concentration of hyperscalers in the space, he said, "any slowdown in the data center buildout is going to have big reverberations in the supply chain." Firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, generating both excitement and apprehension on Wall Street. By the end of the year, hyperscalers will have spent an estimated $222 billion on AI chips and data centers to run the emerging technology. Although AI spending is projected to keep surging, some industry watchers have grown anxious about whether the spending spree can last — especially if AI doesn't live up to the hype. Even Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has warned about overspending on AI, which he described earlier this month as a "race to the bottom. " He added, "While there is a big movement of a lot of companies into these kind of public clouds, I think that we have to be careful exactly how much we're investing." Overspending fears briefly dented the performance of key semiconductor companies in September. Lefever has good reason to pay close attention to the space: Enthusiasm for AI has made semiconductors increasingly complex, boosting demand for Advantest's equipment. ADRs on the Tokyo-based stock are up 71.32% this year as a result. "I don't like to use the word bubble because it implies that it's going to go away, but there will be cycles," Lefever told FT. "When that next cycle comes . . . it could be pretty vicious." AI smartphones, however, could prove the industry's saving grace, Lefever said. "Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the killer app with the AI handsets . . . if that happens and people start replacing their phones, it's going to be crazy," he told FT. Wall Street analysts are equally bullish over AI phones, a consideration already seeping into price targets. On Thursday, Wedbush Securities raised its target on Apple to $325, citing high expectations over Apple Intelligence — an AI software accessible on new iPhone products. "This will be a multi-year AI journey that will define the future for Apple with its next generation chip architecture, hardware releases, and future iPhone models built around the AI foundation that many consumers will ultimately embrace," analyst Dan Ives said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Meta Platforms (META, Financials), Broadcom (AVGO, Financials), and Tesla (TSLA, Financials) all saw weightings within the Nasdaq 100 index shrink after notable stock price gains over the year. Bloomberg data shows that these changes aim to keep the index in balance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META. Among those earning higher weight were Apple (AAPL, Financials), Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), and Alphabet (GOOG, Financials; GOOGL, Financials). The rebalancing follows a rule limiting the total weight of the top five components to around 40%. Projected at 515,000 units with year-over-year rise, Tesla is likely to set a new quarterly record for vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter. Third week of December saw 17,600 weekly insurance registrations for Tesla; its weekly insurance registrations in China showed a 12% rise over previous quarter and a 13% year-on-year increase. Although it declined consecutively from last week, Tesla's quarterly performance in the Chinese market is probably going to be outstanding. A tire pressure monitoring system issue that might lead to an accident by not sufficiently notifying drivers of low tire pressures has caused Tesla to issue a recall for over 700,000 automobiles. Among the specific models from 2017 to 2025, the recall calls especially for the Model 3, Model Y, and the 2024 Cybertruck. Tesla will provide a free over-the-air software update to address the problem. Although some recent dips, Tesla's stock has seen noteworthy rise and now ranks among the $1 trillion market capital value. Shares for this month are up 35%; for this year they are 87%. Broadcom officially joined the $1 trillion club driven by a demand for its chips running artificial intelligence. Its AI-generated fiscal 2024 revenue doubled year-over-year to $12.2 billion, therefore fueling total sales of $51 billion more. Forecasts of a 40% rise in fiscal 2025 and rising market share inspire experts about Broadcom's potential AI income growth. Claiming violation of its patents on "virtual machines," Netflix has sued Broadcom's subsidiary VMware. This legal action feeds ongoing disputes between Netflix and Broadcom that include claims of Netflix breaching Broadcom's video streaming technology patents since 2018. Broadcom's stock has exploded over 100% as demand from artificial intelligence customers takes hold. AI revenue surged 280% to $3.1 billion only in the last quarter. Broadcom's acquisition of a significant quarter growth driver, a cloud computing software company, VMware has also drawn compliments from investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Forecasts of a 40% rise in fiscal 2025 and rising market share inspire experts about Broadcom's potential AI income growth. Claiming violation of its patents on "virtual machines," Netflix has sued Broadcom's subsidiary VMware. This legal action feeds ongoing disputes between Netflix and Broadcom that include claims of Netflix breaching Broadcom's video streaming technology patents since 2018. Broadcom's stock has exploded over 100% as demand from artificial intelligence customers takes hold. AI revenue surged 280% to $3.1 billion only in the last quarter. Broadcom's acquisition of a significant quarter growth driver, a cloud computing software company, VMware has also drawn compliments from investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks struggled to meaningfully extend a "Santa Claus" rally the day after Christmas while Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed the session up 28 points after flipping between positive and negative territory throughout the light trading session. Small cap stocks inched higher, sending the Russell 2000 (^RUT) up 0.9%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to hover near the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets kicked off the "Santa Claus" rally on Tuesday as the S&P 500 notched its best Christmas Eve performance since 1974, according to Bespoke. The broader index and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release of weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. Stocks closed mixed amid a light trading session on Thursday following the Christmas holiday break. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 28 points, or nearly 0.1%. Stocks were little changed throughout the session, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory as the market struggled to meaningfully extend its Santa Claus rally. Small cap stocks however rose as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gained more than 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 15% year-to-date, but Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE) have been the big laggards of 2024. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out, with the exception of Intel (which was booted off the blue-chip index in place of AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in November), industrial giant Boeing is the biggest laggard, down 30% since the start of the year after a slew of production and safety challenges. Sports apparel com[any Nike is also down about 29% since the start of the year. Tesla (TSLA) extended declines to 2% on Thursday afternoon, making it difficult for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to firmly trade in positive territory. Still, shares of the EV maker are up more than 80% year to-date. The majority of those stock gains were achieved following Donald Trump's presidential victory in November, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk was instrumental in supporting. Trading volume for Tesla stock on Thursday was about 30% less than average daily volume, according to Yahoo Finance chart data. Bitcoin was trading 3% lower on Thursday afternoon as prices hovered below the $96,000 level. The token is down about 10% from its all-time highs north of $108,000 reached over a week ago. Despite the recent dip, bitcoin is up nearly 120% year to date, far outperforming other asset classes like gold and the major stock market averages. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports, 2024 has been a year when everything changed for the cryptocurrency once viewed as a fringe sideshow, a concern for D.C. policymakers, and a subject of ridicule for top Wall Street figures. Crypto's widespread acceptance this year translated into major gains for investors who were along for the ride. Stocks wavered by 1 p.m. ET, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hugged the flat line while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed. Shares of EV giant Tesla (TSLA) and social media company Meta (META) both fell, weighing on the Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Meanwhile, chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) rose for a fourth straight day. GameStop (GME) stock rose as much as 10% early Thursday before paring gains. Shares were up roughly 6% midday. The stock's gain comes after infamous meme stock trader "Roaring Kitty" — whose real name is Keith Gill — posted a mysterious photo of a wrapped present on Dec. 25. GME's climb Thursday puts the stock on track to notch a roughly 16% gain over the past five days. The stock is up over 88% in 2024, fueled by Roaring Kitty's return to social media after three years of silence. Still, GameStop shares remain well below all-time highs of over $80 during the stock's short squeeze in 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET. Shares of Honeywell (HON) and Boeing (BA) rose more than 1%, helping lift the blue-chip index slightly above the flatline. Apple (AAPL) touched intraday highs after a price target raise to a Street high of $325 from Wedbush analysts Dan Ives. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pared early morning losses to trade just below the flatline. Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap. Read the full story here. Shares of AI chip heavyweight (NVDA) fell more than 1% while the rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks wavered on Thursday. Technology stocks led the modest market declines as the "Santa Claus rally" from Wednesday took a pause after the Christmas holiday break. Shares of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) flipped between positive and negative territory during morning trading. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: If 2024 was the year of AI chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. Autonomous and semi-autonomous AI systems, you can think of agents as super powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You’ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies.

Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street.

Decrypt conducted analysis using data from CoinGecko and Nasdaq to identify top-performing coins. To qualify, assets needed a starting market cap of at least $500 million, observed from January 1 to December 17. Other digital asset-related investments, including those of major companies, also did quite well. Here's a look at this year's top-performing assets. One of the newer meme tokens to sit near the top of the market, Pepe (PEPE), launched last year. The token is based on Pepe the Frog, an internet cartoon later labeled a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League after alt-right groups strangely adopted it. Pepe hit a new all-time high in December. The Ethereum-based token started the year with a market cap of $590.8 million, but landed at $9.4 billion by December 17—a 1,492% surge. Pepe grabbed headlines for—in typical meme style—its absurd rise in value and how rich it made a small number of traders. But unlike many assets in the bizarre space of meme tokens, Pepe kept going up, and it’s now the 28th biggest coin by market cap. It wasn’t long ago that the little-known Sui (SUI) came on the scene: Launched in May 2023, the blockchain was developed by ex-Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers and now has a buzzing DeFi community using its speedy network. Rapid blockchain Sui’s native SUI token has boomed this year. In January, its market cap stood at $925 million. A 1,193% rise means that by December, it had hit nearly $12 billion. SUI is now the 18th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Michael Saylor’s software company went all in on Bitcoin this year—and the firm’s stock shows that it was trading for less than $70 a share at the start of the year. By December, it had increased nearly fivefold—touching $386. That’s a 464% increase and better than everything else on the Nasdaq, including Nvidia. MicroStrategy was formerly a quiet software company. It then started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and rebranded itself as a “Bitcoin treasury company.” This year, the Tyson, Virginia-based entity accelerated its orange coin buys, promising speculators the best deal for Bitcoin exposure. Investors—including hedge funds looking to get volatile returns—piled in on the stock. The O.G. meme coin. Created as a joke to poke fun at the silly amount of altcoins being minted into existence, Dogecoin (DOGE) is now the seventh largest crypto by market cap. Its market cap jumped by 342% this year and now stands at $45.9 billion. Bitcoin’s rise certainly helped. It’s mainly got Tesla CEO Elon Musk to thank for that: The world’s richest man posted frequently about the asset in 2020-2021, and did so again this year amid speculation that the coin would be used on his platform X (formerly Twitter). XRP has had a strong year. The token facilitates transactions on the Ripple network, which provides institutions with a blockchain solution for cross-border payments. The token’s market cap has shot up so much that it’s now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, increasing 286% from $34 billion to $131.2 billion. It was briefly the third largest this month, overtaking Tether; and on January 1 of this year, it was sixth. The coin has made headlines over its dealings with the authorities. The SEC hit Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit in 2020, alleging that the company sold unregistered securities to investors to raise funds. But last year, the company scored a partial win against the regulator when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges to retail investors did not qualify as securities. The ruling was interpreted as a win by Ripple—and the crypto industry as a whole—despite the judge ruling that $728 million worth of tokens for institutional sales constituted unregistered securities sales. Let's call this one an honorable mention, given the title of this article. It’s been an incredible year for Bitcoin, and the world’s biggest asset manager has played a part by making the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency available to all via an ETF. The iShares Bitcoin Trust is a traditional investment vehicle that allows investors to buy and sell shares that track Bitcoin’s price. The shares are traded on the Nasdaq. When it started trading in January, IBIT broke record after record with trading volume and inflows: By December, it had more than $50 billion in assets under management, achieving the milestone in just 228 days—quicker than any other ETF in history. Several other top asset managers also have Bitcoin ETFs trading, but BlackRock’s product has been the most successful.

US stocks held steady Thursday as trading resumed after the Christmas holiday and Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) held steady after erasing early morning losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.1%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets looked to be struggling in a bid to extend the start of the "Santa Claus rally," which kicked off with a bang on Tuesday. All three major indexes rose around 1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release on weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET.

Title: From Microsoft to Nvidia, the AI agents are coming in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If 2024 was the year of artificial intelligence chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. You can think of agents as super-powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You’ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies. The goal is to cut down on often bothersome, time-consuming tasks like filing expense reports — the bane of my professional existence. Not only will we see more AI agents, we’ll see more major tech companies developing them. Companies using them say they’re seeing changes based on their own internal metrics. According to Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot at Microsoft, the Windows maker has already seen improvements in both responsiveness to IT issues and sales outcomes. According to Lamanna, Microsoft employee IT self-help success increased by 36%, while revenue per seller has increased by 9.4%. The company has also experienced improved HR case resolution times. As with any new technology, using AI agents will take some getting used to. But if they live up to the lofty expectations tech companies are laying out, they could win over plenty of users as an impressive new use case for generative AI. “If … you immediately get very rapid and very accurate and very meaningful and helpful responses, then that can start to change people's habits,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. “But changing people's habits takes a while.” The AI chatbot/AI copilot/AI agent discussion can be a bit confusing. After all, generative AI chatbots still feel like a new technology, and now we’re already being shuffled on to the next big thing. But those three capabilities are all part of the same overall system. Ray Smith, Microsoft’s vice president of AI agents, says you can think of an AI copilot as your main interface for interacting with your chatbot or assistant. Kind of like a home screen for your different AI needs. When you ask your chatbot or assistant to complete various tasks for you, it will reach out to the AI agents with the appropriate capabilities. If that sounds complex, here’s an easy example: Say you want to book a flight. You could tell your chatbot to see what flights are available for you, and it will use different AI agents to check your flight preferences, your calendar and availability, and potentially even your financial apps to make sure you’re getting a flight in your budget range and then come back with a handful of suggested flights. Earlier this month, Google debuted its experimental prototype, Project Mariner, which is capable of navigating the web and performing tasks via Google’s Chrome browser. In a video demo, Google shows an example of a user who needs to look up the contact information for a number of companies listed in a Google Sheets document. The user tells Mariner to memorize the list of companies, go to their websites, and find their contact emails. The agent then actively navigates to each website, grabs the email information, and provides it for each company. Google significantly sped up the process in the demo video, explaining that Mariner is still in its early stages and that it takes time for it to complete requests. But the company says accuracy and speed will improve quickly, though it doesn’t have a set release date. Apple’s (AAPL) Apple Intelligence will eventually offer AI agent-style functionality as well. In upcoming updates, the company says you’ll be able to do things like ask Siri when you should pick up your husband or wife from the airport. The assistant will then check your email to see when the flight is expected to land, check traffic via Apple Maps, and provide you with a suggested time to hit the road. According to Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman, agents will also be able to do things like help workers find potential business opportunities then help them set up and book meetings with prospective clients. Don’t expect high-powered, multistep AI agents to go mainstream as soon as the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Day. We’ll start to see a few next year, but it’ll likely take a bit of work to iron out all of the kinks. Instead, expect companies to lean into more basic enterprise use cases. “There's going to be also what I’ll call more boring agents that do productive things, things that automate IT processes, things that automate other tedious tasks,” O’Donnell said. “Those, I think, are going to become really important next year.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: The biggest gaming controversies of 2024

Layoffs, politics, and the culture wars dominated 2024, but there were plenty of regular, everyday goofs, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. 2024 was a big year for gaming, and so naturally it was also a big year for gaming-related controversies. While hand-wringing over fears that "videogames cause violence" seems to have subsided, at least for now, political and culture wars nonsense is more pronounced than ever. The videogame industry itself, meanwhile, continued to suffer decimation as funding dried up and executives who overplayed their hands during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic slashed headcounts in the name of "sustainability." There's no other way to put it: It got ugly out there. Of course, there were plenty of conventional fumbles too: Dissembling, dishonesty, and some straight-up bad calls provided plenty of "things that actually happened" for gamers to be unhappy about. From Facebook rejecting ads for board games to a weird cat game accused of being built with AI, here's our roundup of the year's biggest lowlights. Our face: 😕 What happened: When board game publisher Fort Circle attempted to purchase Facebook ads for a new edition of Votes for Women, a board game about the women's suffrage movement in the US, it received an unexpected surprise: Facebook said no. The problem, according to an automated response provided by Facebook to the publisher, is that the ad "mentions politicians or is about sensitive social issues that could influence public opinion, how people vote and may impact the outcome of an election or pending legislation." The outcome: You might think that such patent stupidity is the result of a bad algorithm making bad decisions, as they do, and you'd be correct. But when Fort Circle requested a review of the ruling, that too was rejected. Not being able to run ads had a material impact on the Votes for Women crowdfunding campaign—"Most Kickstarter creators will tell you that Facebook advertising is a crucial piece of the crowdfunding puzzle," Fort Circle founder Kevin Bertram said at the time—but more broadly it points to a pretty serious failure in Facebook's review process. Our face: 😡 What happened: In March, a little-known company called Sweet Baby Inc was suddenly thrust into the spotlight by "anti-woke" gamers outraged by, as one put it, the narrative consultants' promulgation of "ideological worldviews that I believe have taken hold of the Western world, media, and gaming as a whole." Which is of course nonsense: The company is contracted by developers who want to improve pre-existing elements of their games, and it has absolutely no power to force anyone to do anything—least of all make wholesale changes to their projects to enforce some sort of imagined "race and identity group quota." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The outcome: As ridiculous as it sounds (and is), the furor was (and is) real. A Steam curator group dedicated to "detecting" the presence of Sweet Baby Inc in games has now swollen to more than 460,000 followers, and the company was forced to lock its social media accounts following a torrent of abuse. Our face: 🤨 What happened: The Fallout TV show on Amazon was a hit, but it made some Fallout die-hards angry because of a perceived lack of faith to the lore. PC Gamer's Chris Livingston broke the whole thing down in detail, but the short version is that aggrieved fans believed Bethesda was using the Amazon show to erase Fallout: New Vegas—a fan-favorite in the series that was notably not developed by Bethesda, but by Obsidian—from the timeline. The outcome: Reactions to the conspiracy theory varied: Showrunner Graham Wagner said the wasteland isn't static and sometimes things happen, New Vegas lead designer Josh Sawyer understands the annoyance but really doesn't give a shit, and Todd Howard, the man currently atop the Fallout creative mountain, expressed mild exasperation about the whole thing, promising that "New Vegas is a very, very important game" to Bethesda. Bottom line? Everyone needs to simmer down. Our face: 🤔 What happened: Battlestate Games shot itself in the foot real good in April with the release of a $250 Unheard Edition of the game that included, among other things, access to co-op PvE—a mode that owners of other editions would have to pay to play. What really stuck in the community's craw, though, was a previously-released $150 Edge of Darkness edition that promised "free access to all subsequent DLCs," but that did not offer access to the new mode. Battlestate argued that the PvE mode was not DLC but a "unique feature of the new game," and thus didn't count. That went over about as well as you'd expect—extremely not well, to be clear—and Battlestate made the situation worse by dicking around with half-baked sops. It eventually offered six months of co-op play for free, but not until some future date because the servers don't have the capacity to handle everyone; on top of that, people who bought the $250 edition were promised priority matchmaking, meaning everyone else would be stuck in longer queues. They were also given access to in-game items protecting them from scavs and enabling more and better gear to be carried, conferring a distinct advantage over others, including those who bought the previously-prized $150 version. The outcome: As PC Gamer's Jake Tucker said, Battlestate "wiped out years of goodwill in one catastrophic week," but somehow it wasn't quite finished stepping on the Lego it'd dumped on the floor. After initially offering owners of the Edge of Darkness edition of Escape from Tarkov an option to upgrade to the newer release for $100 (what a deal), Battlestate reduced the upgrade price to $50; players who had already forked over $100 for the upgrade were offered $50 in "compensation," in the form of a single-use Escape from Tarkov voucher. Our face: 😣 What happened: Not content to sit quietly on the sidelines and watch Battlestate blow years of goodwill to smithereens with unforced errors, Bethesda said "hold my beer" and rolled out a "next-gen" patch for Fallout 4 that PC Gamer's Ted Litchfield described as nothing short of "calamitous." It wasn't just that the update changed so little, it actually made things worse: The added ultrawide support borked the UI, modded saves wouldn't load, and frame rate was still capped at 60. Adding insult to injury, the update rolled out on the heels of the hit Fallout TV show on Amazon, which had sparked a whole new wave of interest in and excitement for the game series, and the mod team behind Fallout London had to delay the total conversion's release to be sure it'd be compatible with the new version. The outcome: An update to the update rolled out a few weeks later, correcting a few issues but leaving the biggest problems for modders to fix. Many of them recommended the simplest fix of all: Use the Fallout 4 Downgrader tool to revert the game to a pre-"next gen" state and be happy with a game that works like it's supposed to. For the record, Fallout 4's next-gen patch hasn't been updated since. Our face: 😵 What happened: The Kerbal Space Program 2 controversy actually kicked off in early 2023 with a catastrophic early access launch, but it took a weird, drawn-out twist in 2024. In May, it was reported that KSP2 developer Intercept Games, along with Rollerdrome studio Roll7, were being closed as part of sweeping layoffs at parent company Take-Two Interactive. But shortly after that report, the Kerbal Space Program X account piped up, saying, "We're still hard at work on KSP2. We'll talk more when we can." Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick threw more confusion on the fire a couple weeks later, saying the closure report wasn't true: "We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear." Zelnick insisted he wasn't trying to be "cute or difficult" about the situation, but yeah, he was being kind of cute and difficult. Not too long after that, Intercept employees confirmed that large numbers of people at the studio, and possibly the entire team, was being laid off. The outcome: In November, Take-Two sold its Private Division publishing label to an unnamed buyer, and at the same time finally confirmed that Intercept and Roll7 had in fact been closed at some point prior to the sale. Take-Two still hasn't explained what happened between 'we haven't closed the studio' and 'the studio is closed.' As for Kerbal Space Program 2, it appears to be cooked: The KSP X account hasn't posted since the "still hard at work" promise in May, and the most recent game update—a relatively small bug-fix patch—went live in June. The game currently has a "mostly negative" overall user rating on Steam, and a concurrent player count that hovers around 100. Our face: 😐 What happened: Arrowhead's fascism-is-fun shooter Helldivers 2 was on a monster roll following its launch in February, but ran face-first into a concrete wall in May when Sony, the game's publisher, announced that players on Steam would be required to have a PlayStation Network account if they wanted to keep playing. That was the plan from the start, but the requirement was initially put on hold because of server issues when the game first went live. That didn't mollify players, who came hard with the time-honored tradition of a review-bombing: More than 220,000 negative reviews flooded into Steam, dragging Helldivers 2's "overwhelmingly positive" rating to "mixed." Sony stood its ground briefly but eventually backed down, leaving Arrowhead to clean up the mess. The outcome: An influx of positive reviews followed in the wake of Operation Cleanup, but like grassy fields in France that remain pockmarked with shell craters, evidence of the battle remains in the game's "mostly positive" rating on Steam: Good, but nowhere near what it used to be. And despite the debacle, Sony isn't giving up on the PSN account requirement on PC: President Hiroki Totoki said in November that linked accounts are necessary so people can "safely" play its games. Our face: 😬 What happened: Things went sideways in a hurry for Tekken pro Kim "JDCR" Hyun-jin, who was about to claim victory against opponent Alexandra "AK" Laverez at Dreamhack Dallas when his controller crapped out, eventually determined to be the result of someone who was previously connected to the setup turning their controller on. That forced a redo of the match, and that didn't go over well: As PC Gamer's resident fighting game pro Mollie Taylor recounted, "Twitch chat can be seen saying things like 'JDCR won that fair and square,' 'JDCR ALREADY WON,' 'JDCR got screwed,' and 'Jdcr won. This is rigged'." When the do-over match eventually went ahead, AK—who was undoubtedly going to lose prior to the technical trouble—came out on top, and the reaction was predictable. AK received "a heaping of rather undue hate," Taylor wrote: Some said he should have forfeited the match, others went so far as to claim that he'd intentionally sabotaged JDCR's controller connection in order to avoid a loss. The outcome: JDCR ultimately finished ninth in the tournament, just missing out on a top-eight finish that would have earned him a qualifying position at the Esports World Cup. DreamHack founder Alex Jebailey said on Twitter that he felt "incredibly sorry for what happened" and that he'd help JDCR attend future qualifiers for another World Cup shot. But, he added, "the amount of death threats and crazy things being said to me are pretty horrendous." Our face: 🤠 What happened: Starfield was a perfectly fine Bethesda RPG, but didn't quite live up to the pre-release hype. The mood among players soured further as months went by with minimal support, and the launch of the Starfield Creation Kit in June did not improve things. The big problem was the release of a single Trackers Alliance mission called The Vulture that cost $7, which thanks to the magic of Starfield Creation Credits bundle pricing was in reality $10. Unhappy players likened the DLC to Oblivion's infamous Horse Armor, the 2006 add-on that heralded the era of cosmetic microtransactions. The outcome: Horse Armor won in 2006, and despite the widespread early upset it looks like The Vulture did too: In response to the backlash, Todd Howard said "we hear the feedback" (ie., a small review bombing campaign on Steam) but Bethesda hasn't budget on the price, and it remains among the most popular of more than 2,700 Starfield creations. Our face: 🤬 What happened: Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a nexus of anti-woke gamer upset since revealing Yasuke, one of its two protagonists. Yasuke is a real-life historical figure who lived in Japan in the 16th century and eventually became an attendant of Oda Nobunaga. He's an ideal fit for an Assassin's Creed character, but he's also Black, and that caused great distress among certain corners of the gaming world, who very suddenly discovered a new commitment to historical authenticity (it's widely believed Yasuke served as a samurai, but not known for certain) and felt that featuring him instead of a "real" Japanese samurai was disrespectful to Japan. X owner Elon Musk amplified that sentiment in May, replying to a complaint about the game posted on his platform that "DEI kills art." Ubisoft's ham-fisted efforts to address what it apparently imagined were good-faith concerns about the game, meanwhile, only made the whole situation worse. It got to the point where even Reddit was sick of dealing with it. Other, more self-inflicted problems cropped up over the second half of the year. In July, Ubisoft apologized for using a real-life reenactment group's flag in Assassin's Creed Shadows concept art without permission, and in October the maker of a collectible said it would be redesigned following complaints that it bore a striking resemblance to the one-legged torii standing outside the Sannō Shrine, a remnant of the 1945 nuclear attack on the city of Nagasaki. Frankly, though, I don't think either issue would have attracted nearly as much attention had the anger pump not already been primed by the inclusion of Yasuke. The outcome: Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed in September to February 14, 2025, so we're still waiting to see how that works out, but it's been interesting watching Ubisoft grapple with the blowback. There seems to be confusion, or perhaps conflict, on how best to approach it: Executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté said in June that Musk was "feeding hatred," but in September, after announcing the delay, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot took pains to reassure everyone that "our goal is not to push any specific agenda" with games. But Coté is having none of that, saying more forcefully in November that some of Assassin's Creed Shadows' loudest critics post "lies, half truths and personal attacks online," and that "when we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away." Our face: 🤢 What happened: Guy Beahm, better known online as the streamer Dr Disrespect, was banned from Twitch for life in 2020. But the reason for his ouster remained a secret until June 2024, when a former Twitch employee alleged that Beahm was shown the door because he was caught "sexting a minor" through Twitch's Whispers messaging system. A few days later, Beahm acknowledged exchanging messages with a minor in 2017 "that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," but insisted that "nothing illegal happened" and that he never faced criminal charges as a result of his actions. The outcome: The fallout was immediate and severe. Beahm was fired by Midnight Society, the game studio he co-founded in 2021, when the allegations first came to light; shortly after his public admission, 2K Games, Turtle Beach, the NFL, and YouTube also cut ties with the streamer. Our face: 😧 What happened: Destiny 2 studio Bungie laid off 220 employees in July, less than a year after an October 2023 layoff that saw a number of long-time and high-profile staffers put out of work. What really pissed people off, though, were claims that Bungie CEO Pete Parsons had spent more than $2.4 million on vintage cars over the two years leading up to the layoffs. Parson's money to spend, yes, and not a huge amount of it compared to the cash Destiny 2 has hoovered in over the years, but as PC Gamer's Harvey Randall put it, "Isn't it weird that he has so much of it while his now-former employees face anxiety over their basic living expenses?" Some former Bungie employees sure thought so. The reaction to Parsons' vehicular habits was no doubt amplified to some extent by his public performance in the wake of those October 2023 layoffs, in which he did his best to present himself as an innocent bystander rather than a well-paid, still-employed studio chief. As one person said in response to Parsons' post about those layoffs on X, "Your senior social lead probably would have recommended against this post, which you would have known had you not let them go." The outcome: Destiny 2 is still grinding along, but the road ahead hasn't gotten any smoother. In October, Sony carved off more of Bungie, making its Creative Studios arm a part of PlayStation Studios, and in December former Destiny 2 and Marathon director Christopher Barrett, who was fired in April over allegations of inappropriate behavior with female employees, sued the company for $200 million, saying Bungie "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating they had 'investigated' Barrett and 'found' he had engaged in sexual misconduct." Our face: 😮 What happened: Amina Abakarova, a 40 year-old chess player from the Russian Republic of Dagestan, was scheduled to play Umayganat Osmanova, a 30 year-old longtime rival who had beaten Abakarova into second place in a tournament the week prior. Not wanting to risk a second consecutive L, Abakarova decided to up her game by smearing liquid mercury all over the chess board and pieces they were meant to use. Mercury is of course very poisonous, and Osmanova began complaining that she was unwell, nauseous and dizzy around half an hour after the game began. Doctors were called in, and were fortunately able to prevent her from succumbing to the poison. The outcome: Abakarova might be a really good chess player, but she's not much of a criminal mastermind. She applied the poison in full view of security cameras, and was thus quickly busted by police. She reportedly copped to the whole thing, not because she wanted to win the match but just because she really doesn't like Osmanova, and now she's facing up to three years in prison and a lifetime ban from competitive chess play. It may not seem like a world-shattering controversy from our videogame-centric perspective, but it was a very big deal in the world of chess: Malcolm Pein of the English Chess Federation said he'd "never seen anything like this before," adding that it was "the first recorded case of somebody using a toxic substance, to my knowledge, in the history of the game of chess." Our face: 😒 What happened: Black Myth: Wukong is a good game and a major success, but it's also become a pivot point in the culture wars thanks to a 2023 IGN report on the long history of sexism at developer Game Science. The issue was put back under the spotlight in August 2024 when the studio sent out streaming guidelines just ahead of Black Myth: Wukong's release forbidding, among other things, "feminist propaganda" during streams. Naturally, the usual parts of the Twittersphere were thrilled to see a developer being so "based," especially since Black Myth: Wukong was a hit, proof positive that 'real gamers' don't want politics in their videogames, or somesuch. Others viewed the whole thing more as just strange and a little creepy. The outcome: Game Science has steadfastly refused to even acknowledge the issue: On multiple occasions, both before and after the streamer guidelines came to light, the studio has kept its head down and refused to comment on the controversy. Which may be a comment in itself: As PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon wrote, "It's hard not to read the silence as a sign that Game Science feels it has nothing to apologize for." Our face: 😶 What happened: Mega-YouTuber Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson had a good first-half in 2024, with his main account becoming the most-subscribed channel on the platform in June, but a very bad second half, as his media empire became embroiled in multiple scandals. Longtime collaborator Ava Kris Tyson was accused of grooming a 14-year-old fan after an exchange of inappropriate messages came to light, and while Donaldson quickly cut ties with Tyson, more trouble followed. Contestants in his Beast Games competition, a real-life Squid Games knockoff, complained of poor treatment, and former employees came forward to say some elements of his videos were either faked or rigged—and that they'd been mistreated themselves. The outcome: Rather than issuing the standard mea culpa that so often comes in the wake of this sort of thing, Donaldson is trying to power through it, keeping his head down, his mouth shut, and the videos rolling. So far it seems to be working: His subscriber numbers continue to climb, and his videos are still attracting hundreds of millions of viewers. Our face: 🙄 What happened: Legendary game designer and bullshitter extraordinaire Peter Molyneux said in August that he's "coming home" to PC, which would've been exciting news in, say, 2006. But in 2024, the bloom is off the rose thanks to a long series of catastrophes including Curiosity, Godus and the follow-up Godus Wars, and Legacy, a blockchain-based business sim that raised a huge pile of money in pre-release land sales (although apparently not quite the $54 million claimed by some reports) and then immediately tanked. Which isn't to say Molyneux's new thing, the god game Masters of Albion, will necessarily be bad. If anything, it actually shows some real promise: Superficially, it looks a bit like Populous mashed up with Fable, and if Molyneux's 22cans studio can pull it off, that definitely might not suck. The outcome: Impossible to say at this point because nothing else has happened, but memories of the last decade-plus will not be forgotten, and that puts the whole thing in a deep hole right from the start. I hope he's able to climb out of it and clock us all in the head with one final, great triumph, but the days of granting Molyneux the benefit of the doubt are long over. Our face: 😢 What happened: The online shooter Concord was one of the biggest, most spectacular flameouts in videogame history: After sinking vast amounts of money into the project, including the outright purchase of developer Firewalk Studios in 2023, mixed user reviews and abysmally low player counts sealed its doom immediately. Some hoped Concord might get a second shot at life as a free-to-play game, but Sony shot down that proposition in October: Concord, like the proverbial parrot, is dead. The outcome: It was an ugly mess by any measure, but what was particularly notable in the wake of Concord's failure was the glee it prompted from some corners of the gaming world: Gloating, memes, and shared screenshots of the game's concurrent player count on Steam dominated the post-closure discourse. PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde said "the eagerness to grave dance on unpopular games has become a bad habit," and he's absolutely right. Concord was at best a perfectly fine shooter trying to break into a crowded genre where "perfectly fine" isn't nearly good enough, and there's plenty of space for analysis and discussion of how it all went so completely wrong. But cheering its loss—and the subsequent closure of Firewalk—does no one any good. Our face: 🤢🤢🤢 What happened: The Dr Disrespect comeback tour began in September with a 20-minute rant on his YouTube channel, in which he said his Twitch suspension was primarily the result of a conspiracy against him. But it didn't really kick into gear until October, when YouTube declined to remonetize his channel. In response, the streamer teased "something much, much bigger" in the works, which in November turned out to be a move to Rumble, the right-wing streaming platform that hosts the likes of Dan Bongino, Steven Crowder, Viva Frei, Russell Brand, The Quartering, and the Tate Brothers. The outcome: Well, Dr Disrespect is on Rumble now. The numbers aren't nearly the same at this point—he's currently at a little over 76,000 followers on Rumble, a small fraction of the 4.55 million he'd amassed on YouTube—but he's not just streaming there: His deal with the platform includes equity in the company, and he will also lead Rumble Gaming, its videogame-focused livestream category. Lest there be any doubt about his commitment to the cause, the move came a month after he announced a line of "Make Gaming Great Again" merchandise modeled after the campaign slogan of US president-elect Donald Trump. Our face: 😠 What happened: Under pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, a major American non-profit that campaigns against antisemitism and promotes Zionism as a movement for "self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland," Twitch banned several Arab streamers in October over a TwitchCon panel that had occurred a month earlier. Panelists had put together a tier list ranking various streamers from "Arab" to "loves Sabra", an American and Israeli-owned hummus brand; Twitch partner and panel host Frogan said the panel was about "who has a habibi pass" (habibi is Arabic for "my love") but the ADL characterized it as "antisemitic vitriol." The ban came a week after Twitch suspended Asmongold for his racist tirade against Palestinians, and the discovery that Twitch had stopped signups with email verification from both Israel and Palestine for more than a year, which it said was done "to prevent uploads of graphic material" following the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023—a "temporary" measure it apparently forgot to reverse. The outcome: Following weeks of back-and-forth complaints of Islamophobia and antisemitism on the platform, Twitch rolled out a policy requiring a warning label for streams about vaguely-defined "politics and sensitive social issues," which included discussions about topics including "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration." Twitch modified the guidelines a few days later to remove LGBTQ+ references but the rules remained too vague to be useful in any meaningful way; days after that, again under pressure from the ADL, Twitch forbid the use of the word "Zionist" to "attack or demean" other people or groups, but said it could still be used in its political context. Our face: 🤡 What happened: X owner and soon-to-be co-president of the United States Elon Musk made the bizarre statement on his platform that "too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations," before promising that "xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!" The outcome: Setting aside the fact that making games is really hard and nobody knows what an "AI game studio" is beyond some imagined Star Trek-style fantasy that doesn't actually exist, the statement was especially strange coming from a man with whose net worth is counted in the hundreds of billions—he's literally the wealthiest man on the planet—and who heads up a number of pretty famous "massive corporations" of his own. The real motivation for Musk's promised move into the industry was revealed by a later tweet to be less about concerns over corporate ownership, and more about wanting games that "skip the woke lecture." The segment of the gaming community up in arms about "wokeness" in videogames was thrilled to see Musk wading into the fray, but there's been no more said about it since. Our face: 😔 What happened: Hardware maker NZXT came under fire in December for its Flex PC rental service, which a Gamers Nexus exposé called a "predatory, evil rental computer scam." Specific complaints included allegations that NZXT would sometimes swap out components in rented PCs with less powerful hardware, use seemingly false or misleading benchmarks, and lock rental customers into unfair contracts. The outcome: NZXT defended its practices in response, but acknowledged that it "messed up" on some points. It committed to greater clarity on various points of the program and an end to "influencer-led" advertising, and also spent a good chunk of text laying out the "use case" for the Flex rental program, which NZXT said "allows for flexibility and lower commitment than owning or financing a PC." The response did not calm the waters: A video of NZXT CEO Johnny Hou discussing the matter has received 331 likes on YouTube, and more than 6,400 dislikes. Our face: 🐱 What happened: Catly, a weird game about cats, dropped a reveal trailer at the 2024 Game Awards. Rather than being greeting with the presumably-expected "awww, they're so cute," though, the trailer sparked immediate speculation (and some straight-up accusations) that it was made with generative AI. The game itself, from the very little that could be seen of it, struck many as little more than an NFT showcase. Those concerns were heightened by reports that Kevin Yeung, the co-founder of developer SuperAuthenti, is also co-founder of TenthPlanet, a studio that definitely is (or at least was) working on blockchain projects. The outcome: SuperAuthenti has been oddly quiet about the whole thing, although it did eventually state that Catly does not use AI and has "zero blockchain technology." Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see: A post-announcement update to the Steam page provided a closer look at what the game is all about, but more details won't be revealed until sometime in 2025. Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80. From there he graduated to the glory days of Sierra Online adventures and Microprose sims, ran a local BBS, learned how to build PCs, and developed a longstanding love of RPGs, immersive sims, and shooters. He began writing videogame news in 2007 for The Escapist and somehow managed to avoid getting fired until 2014, when he joined the storied ranks of PC Gamer. He covers all aspects of the industry, from new game announcements and patch notes to legal disputes, Twitch beefs, esports, and Henry Cavill. Lots of Henry Cavill. The 20 best hidden gems from 2024 to grab before the end of the Steam Winter sale I'm still reeling from the knowledge that the Windows 10 desktop background is a real photo and not CGI Infinity Nikki's 1.1 update, Shooting Star Season, is out now PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: More Reasons For Cautious Optimism About The Demise Of The Green Energy Fantasy
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4286494/posts
Time Published: 2024-12-26T13:13:04Z
Full Content:
Skip to comments. Posted on 12/26/2024 5:13:04 AM PST by MtnClimber My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters.

Title: How Stocks Perform After Nasdaq-100 Rebalancing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s that time of year again — the annual rebalancing of the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX). The NDX represents the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. On Monday, three new companies were added to the index, and three others were removed. When a stock is included in a widely followed index, it often generates demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds, while removal typically leads to selling pressure. These changes were announced about a couple weeks ago, meaning much of the buying and selling has already occurred. This week, I’m examining what happens once these stocks begin trading in the index. One theory is that the announcement of additions and removals can shift sentiment, and if the initial buying or selling overshoots, it can create opportunities going forward. Before diving into the historical data, the tables below show the stocks that were added as well as those removed. Goin back to 2010, I tracked 80 stocks added to the NDX and 73 removed. We don’t have data on some of the stocks that aren’t trading anymore. I am also only considering stocks added and removed in December during the rebalancing. I will not be considering stocks eliminated and added mid-year due to bankruptcy, mergers, etc. The tables below summarize the returns of the stocks added and removed since 2010. The stocks that were removed performed better than those added. Stocks added to the index in December averaged a return of 3.81% over the next three months, compared to a 7.27% gain for those removed. Over the next three months, less than half the stocks added beat NDX, but 56% of those removed beat the NDX. One year later, the stocks added to the index averaged a gain of about 12%, with 40% of the stocks beating the overall index. Those figures underperform compared to stocks removed from the index, which averaged a pop of 18% over the next year, with 52% of those stocks beating the NDX. Based on these numbers, there could be merit to the theory that sentiment tends to get too bullish for those added, and too bearish for those removed. Next, I incorporated analyst ratings to identify stocks with extreme sentiment. Stocks added to the index are prone to excessive bullish sentiment. Using my historical data, I focused on stocks added that had at least 80% of analysts recommending a "buy" on the day they were added. This may be an indicator of sentiment being too bullish. Conversely, stocks removed from the index can attract excessive bearish sentiment. I analyzed stocks removed with 20% or fewer firms sporting a "buy" rating. If this theory holds, stocks added with bullish sentiment may underperform, while those removed with bearish sentiment may outperform. The numbers in the table below suggest there’s merit to the theory. For those one-year returns, stocks removed where 20% or fewer firms had a "buy" rating averaged a gain of 34% in the next year, with 58% of stocks beating the index. This means it may be worth considering Moderna (MRNA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) as potential stocks to buy. The data below also suggests avoiding stocks that were added that have at least 80% of analysts calling it a "buy." In the next year, these stocks gained less than 5% on average, with just 22% of them beating the NDX. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock was added to the index this year, and all 15 firms call it a "buy." Our data suggests it has an increased chance of underperforming moving forward. MicroStrategy (MSTR) doesn’t meet the criteria of the study, because I only considered stocks with at least 10 brokerages in coverage. However, all eight analysts suggest buying SMCI, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it underperforms going forward. Sign in to access your portfolio

Oracle's co-founder has gained roughly $75 billion in paper wealth as the software company he started in 1979 enjoyed its biggest stock rally since 1999 and the dot-com boom. While the S&P 500 index has gained 27% in 2024, Oracle shares have shot up 63%, lifting Ellison's net worth to more than $217 billion, according to Forbes, behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among the world's richest people. At 80, Ellison is a senior citizen in the tech industry, where his fellow billionaire founders are generally decades younger. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth has also ballooned past $200 billion, is half his age. But Ellison has found the fountain of youth both personally and professionally. After being divorced several times, Ellison was reported this month to be involved with a 33-year-old woman. And at a meeting with analysts in Las Vegas in September, Ellison was as engaged as ever, mentioning offhand that the night before, he and his son were having dinner with his good friend Musk, who's advising President-elect Donald Trump (then the Republican nominee) while running Tesla and his other ventures. His big financial boon has come from Oracle, which has maneuvered its way into the artificial intelligence craze with its cloud infrastructure technology and has made its databases more accessible. ChatGPT creator OpenAI said in June that it will use Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Earlier this month, Oracle said it had also picked up business from Meta. Startups, which often opt for market leader Amazon Web Services when picking a cloud, have been engaging Oracle as well. Last year, video generation startup Genmo set up a system to train an AI model with Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, in Oracle's cloud, CEO Paras Jain said. Genmo now relies on the Oracle cloud to produce videos based on the prompts that users type in on its website. "Oracle produced a different product than what you can get elsewhere with GPU computing," Jain said. The company offers "bare metal" computers that can sometimes yield better performance than architectures that employ server virtualization, he said. In its latest earnings report earlier this month, Oracle came up short of analysts' estimates and issued a forecast that was also weaker than Wall Street was expecting. The next day, the stock fell 7% in the worst performance of the year, eating into the gains for 2024. Still, Ellison was bullish for the future. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Ellison said in the earnings release. For the current fiscal year, which ends in May, Oracle is expected to record revenue growth of about 10%, which would mark its second-strongest year of expansion since 2011. Jain said that when Genmo has challenges, he communicates with Oracle sales executives and engineers through a Slack channel. The collaboration has resulted in better reliability and performance, he said. Jain said Oracle worked with Genmo to ensure that developers could launch the startup's Mochi open-source video generator on Oracle's cloud hardware with a single click. "Oracle was also more price-competitive than these large hyperscalers," Jain said. Three months before its December earnings report, at the analyst event in Las Vegas, Oracle had given a rosy outlook for the next three years. Executive Vice President Doug Kehring declared that the company would produce more than $66 billion in revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, and over $104 billion in fiscal 2029. The numbers suggested acceleration, with a compound annual growth rate of over 16%, compared with 9% in the latest quarter. After Kehring and CEO Safra Catz spoke, it was Ellison's turn. The company's chairman, technology chief and top shareholder strutted onto the stage in a black sweater and jeans, waved to the analysts, licked his lips and sat down. For the next 74 minutes, he answered questions from seven analysts. "Did — did he say $104 billion?" Ellison said, referring to Kehring's projection. Some in the crowd giggled. "That's going to be so easy. It is kind of crazy." Oracle's revenue in fiscal 2023 was just shy of $50 billion. The new target impressed Eric Lynch, managing director of Scharf Investments, which held $167 million in Oracle shares at the end of September. "For a company doing single digits for a decade or so, that's unbelievable," Lynch told CNBC in an interview. Oracle is still far behind in cloud infrastructure. In 2023, Amazon controlled 39% of the market, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 8.2%, according to industry researcher Gartner. That left Oracle with 1.4%. But in database software, Oracle remains a stalwart. Gartner estimated that the company had 17% market share in database management systems in 2023. Ellison's challenge is to find opportunities for expansion. Last year, he visited Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, for the first time to announce a partnership that would enable organizations to use Oracle's database through Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft even installed Oracle hardware in its data centers. In June, Oracle rolled out a similar announcement with Google. Then, in September, Oracle finally partnered with Amazon, introducing its database on AWS. Oracle and Amazon had exchanged barbs for years. AWS introduced a database called Aurora in 2014, and Amazon worked hard to move itself off Oracle. Following a CNBC report on the effort, Ellison expressed doubt about Amazon's ability to reach its goal. But the project succeeded. In 2019, Amazon published a blog post titled, "Migration Complete – Amazon's Consumer Business Just Turned off its Final Oracle Database." Ellison looked back on the history between the two companies at the analyst meeting in September. "I got kind of got cute commenting about Amazon uses Oracle, doesn't use AWS, blah, blah," he said. "And that hurt some people's feelings. I probably shouldn't have said it." He said a friend at a major New York bank had asked him to make sure the Oracle database works on AWS. "I said, 'Great. It makes sense to me,'" Ellison said. The multi-cloud strategy should deliver gains in database market share, said analyst Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho, which has the equivalent of a buy rating on Oracle shares. Cloud deals related to AI will also help Oracle deliver on its promise for faster revenue growth, he said. "Oracle right now has an end-to-end stack for enterprises to build their AI strategy," said Panigrahi, who worked on applications at Oracle in the 2000s. So far, Oracle has been mainly cutting high-value AI deals with the likes of OpenAI and Musk's X.ai. Of Oracle's $97 billion in remaining performance obligations, or revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, 40% or 50% of it is tied to renting out GPUs, Panigrahi said. Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment. Panigrahi predicts that a wider swath of enterprises will begin adopting AI, which will be a boon to Oracle given its hundreds of thousands of big customers. There's also promise in Oracle Health, the segment that came out of the company's $28.2 billion acquisition of electronic health record software vendor Cerner in 2022. Unlike rival Epic, Oracle Health lost U.S. market share in 2023, according to estimates from KLAS Research. But Ellison's connection to Musk, who is set to co-lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, might benefit Oracle Health "if there is a bigger push towards modernizing existing healthcare systems," analysts at Evercore said in a note last week. They recommend buying the stock. For now, Oracle is busy using AI to rewrite Cerner's entire code base, Ellison said at the analyst event. "This is another pillar for growth," he said. "I think you haven't quite seen it yet." Hours earlier, Ellison had put in a call to Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. Benioff knows Ellison as well as anyone, having worked for him for 13 years before starting the cloud software company that's now a big competitor.

December 26, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: How Consumers Can Prepare For Trump's New Tariffs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dearbeawalker/2024/12/26/how-consumers-can-prepare-for-trumps-new-tariffs/
Time Published: 2024-12-26T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on all imports from Mexico, Canada and China. This will impact the price of everything from washing machines to garlic. Here’s how you can prepare. Weekly grocery bills are likely to get more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump follows through in imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China. Everything from avocados to garlic will go up. That new car you’re eyeing—or even your next grocery run—could cost more after President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump plans to sign an Executive Order on day one that would impose 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and threatens additional tariffs on products from China and elsewhere. Trump said that tariffs will “make our country rich,” because the U.S. “right now loses to everybody.” Specifically, Trump has said he'll boost tariffs to 60% or more on goods from China. “The prospect of a trade war looms large, not just between the U.S. and China but beyond,” Forbes markets contributor Courtney Fingar writes. Here’s what these proposed tariffs are designed to do and what they could mean for American consumers, who should be prepared for potential price hikes. A tariff is a tax on imported goods that companies pay to the government when they import products to the U.S., and that tax is usually passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. “That extra cost has to get covered one way or another, either by coming out of the importing company’s margins or by being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices,” Forbes contributor Joe Moglia says. “If the tariffs are too high, there may be no choice other than raising prices.” The purpose of tariffs is to raise the price of foreign-produced goods, prompting consumers to purchase less-expensive domestic goods and services. Tariffs are not new for Americans. The U.S. has long used them as a tool to regulate trade with import duties that vary by product and trading partner. Ultimately, tariffs aim to protect U.S. industries from foreign competitors and raise revenue for the government. A 20% universal tariff could raise $3.3 trillion for the government from 2025 to 2034, according to the Tax Foundation. This is before factoring in the effects on the economy and any retaliatory actions by trade partners, including other countries and trade blocs like the EU. Experts believe Trump's tariffs threat is a negotiating tool to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Trump's rationale for his proposed tariffs includes restoring manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and, some experts say, using tariffs as a trade negotiating tool. In addition to the economic motivations, Trump cites security: He has insisted that Mexico and Canada stem the flow of illegal drugs and migrants over the border. “Financial markets have not reacted thus far, because many investors view the threats as a bargaining ploy on Trump’s part,” Forbes contributor Nick Sargen writes. Here’s what Trump has proposed: Tariffs on raw materials like steel or aluminum could send the prices of cellphones and laptops through the roof, according to True Tamplin, a Forbes personal finance contributor. “For example, a 10% ad valorem tariff on a $1,000 laptop would add $100 to its price,” Tamplin writes. Your occasional Modelo or Corona beer, brewed in Mexico, could also go up, Kate Benot, the lead analyst at Sightlines told Forbes spirits contributor Don Tse. “Indirectly, they’re also likely to raise the price of beer in aggregate, even beer that’s made in the U.S. or countries not subject to tariffs,” Bernot told Tse. “If the most popular beers in the country are suddenly more expensive, it gives other producers license to increase prices as well.” Bernot said. Other goods that could become more expensive: “Industries with lots of exposure to imported goods—retail, electronics and even agriculture—could face significant headwinds,” Forbes markets contributor, Frank Holmes writes. The roots of a potential trade war go back to Trump’s first term. A report at the time showed that the U.S. was experiencing job cuts in manufacturing starting in 2001 while China was engaged in unfair trade practices, running large trade surpluses with the U.S. The U.S. also accused China of intellectual property theft —a growing risk to national security. “Over the next year and a half, the U.S. phased in tariffs on imports from China that eventually accounted for about one-half of the goods it shipped to the U.S.,” Sargen, a financial markets contributor, says. Prices rose 12% on products like washing machines and dryers, a 2019 study by the Federal Reserve Board and the University of Chicago found. And U.S. companies lost at least $1.7 trillion in market cap, according to a 2020 study by Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University. “The tariffs had an impact on U.S. company stock values because, it turns out, tariff increases are a form of industrial policy that lose money for U.S. companies and investors,” Forbes leadership contributor, Stuart Anderson wrote at the time. China and India notably retaliated against Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel imports in 2018, but experts believe Trump’s new tariffs could have an even more significant impact, Sargen says. China has passed laws since 2018 to better respond to U.S. tariffs and President Biden has not only kept Trump’s tariffs in place, but he has imposed additional tariffs on China. Many investors believe Trump’s tariff threat is just that Sargen says: a negotiating tactic. While tariffs can be effective in negotiations, they do risk counter-measures from the exporting country, potentially leading to job losses, price hikes and higher cost of living at home, Sargen writes. However, it’s likely that the price increases will but will not be ongoing. “Price changes that result from tariffs typically occur all at once,” Bill Conerly, Forbes leadership contributor writes. There’s also the risk of the spillover effect. Retailers importing the goods will increase the price to absorb the cost of the tariff, however, domestic producers, who aren’t impacted by the tariffs, will feel emboldened and may raise their prices too. We saw this during Trump’s first term when the price of both washers and dryers rose 12%. Washers were subjected to the tariffs, dryers were not. It’s likely that prices will go up for everyone — consumers and retailers — but it’s not guaranteed. Global retailers like Macy’s or Kroger will have to diversify sourcing options and strengthen supplier relationships through long-term contracts if they want to stay competitive in the tariff-entrenched market, Forbes retail contributor Shelley E. Kohan writes. On the other hand, vendors on sites like Amazon, Etsy and Temu have more options. As Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters writes, the de minimis law allows direct-to-consumer platforms like Temu to potentially avoid tariffs on individual shipments up to $800 per day, while traditional retailers and sellers importing in bulk would face the full impact. The Wall Street Journal reported that retailers have already begun buying in bulk, which Kohan warns can be a huge gamble. “While some retailers have made commitments to advance the purchasing of goods from overseas sources, this can be a large outlay of capital that may not turn into planned margins but instead may lead to overstocks or excessive markdowns,” Kohan says. However, there are retailers that are looking to take advantage of other retailers' panic buying. Retailers with a secondary-brand purchase business model like TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, are looking at the tariffs as an opportunity. The company's CEO, Ernie Herrman, said during a recent earnings call that the company is hoping manufacturers will stock up ahead of the tariffs, creating a surplus of goods and lower prices. TJX purchases goods after they’ve reached the U.S., allowing it to mark down prices 20 to 60%. As you prepare for a potentially higher grocery bill and an overall higher cost of living, Forbes contributor Taylor Bauldwin suggests that you look to discount or bulk retailers, like Costco and Sam’s Club. They could be great options for groceries, appliances and electronics. Local farmer markets in some areas could also be an option for groceries. There's a caveat: As demand increases for local and seasonal shops, it could drive up those prices, too. “The rising cost of produce due to tariffs underscores how global policies can directly impact everyday expenses for consumers,” Bauldwin writes.

Title: Trump is surrounding himself with a tight-knit group of right-wing tech barons

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with an interconnected group of tech barons. President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with a tight-knit group of wealthy tech barons whose ideas will help define his second term in the White House. Three key allies — members of a group known as “the PayPal Mafia” for their involvement in the money-transfer company two decades ago — seem to be shaping policy and staffing decisions in Trump’s incoming administration, and they are part of an expansive right-wing tech network that will accompany Trump back into power. The network is highly interconnected, sharing not only a political alliance but also social ties, investment opportunities, anti-regulatory ideas and geographic proximity in Austin, Texas, or Northern California. Some of their friendships and professional connections go back decades, and almost all the members of the network are men. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been called the “shadow president” or “first buddy,” and he wants to take a hatchet to the federal budget at Trump’s request as co-lead of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. David Sacks, a tech investor and podcaster, will have the role of Trump’s tech “czar,” advising him on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Peter Thiel, a longtime Trump supporter, has given the incoming Trump administration a staffing pipeline filled with at least 10 of his former co-workers, employees or investing partners — including Vice President-elect JD Vance. And dozens of other tech figures are now orbiting in Trump’s gravity, as either informal advisers, government officials-in-waiting or supporters pushing Trump’s agenda from outside Washington. While some converted to his side only recently, many of the tech figures know one another very well. “They’ve turned profits into power,” said Rob Lalka, author of the book “The Venture Alchemists,” which came out this year and profiled many of the figures who are headed into the administration. Lalka, a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business, said several characteristics define the technologists surrounding Trump, including their wealth and skepticism of institutions and the heavily online personas they’ve created. And he said they have a shared history, with many of them overlapping at Stanford University during and after Thiel’s time there. “That contrarianism, it doesn’t come out of nowhere. It comes from real-life experiences they had as college students,” he said. In other words: A right-wing faction has coalesced within the usually progressive tech industry, and much of it is preparing to make Washington a second home for the next four years. The Trump transition team describes it as a natural fit. “President Trump’s agenda includes economic, energy and regulatory policies that will allow the US to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the transition, said in a statement. “President Trump is surrounding himself with industry leaders like Elon Musk as he works to restore innovation, reduce regulation, and celebrate free speech in his second term,” he said. Musk, Sacks and Thiel didn’t respond to requests for comment on the transition. Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, said it’s notable that many in the tech industry crowd that’s close to Trump don’t come from the biggest-name tech companies, such as Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft. “This specific group is unique because it’s coming a lot from venture,” he said, referring to venture capitalists who invest in startups. “Venture is very different from Big Seven incumbent tech. The Big Seven incumbent tech, those people are trying to be very neutral.” The Magnificent 7 collection of tech companies includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla. Venture capitalists often are less interested in corporate initiatives such as diversity programs, he said. Instead, they have a reputation for ruthless competition, focusing in their most extreme moments on growth at all costs and upending the existing order. “The contrarian culture of Silicon Valley and venture has pushed back against big corporate ideas coming out of the professional managerial class,” he said. Trump’s second term won’t be the first administration to have strong influence from the modern tech industry. The Obama administration was closely tied to tech, especially to Google and its executives, such as former CEO Eric Schmidt. But there’s little overlap between the tech figures who advised President Barack Obama and those working now for Trump. And there’s a different dynamic this time around, said Nathan Leamer, a Republican consultant in Washington and CEO of Fixed Gear Strategies. “Obama was following Big Tech’s lead in 2008, and there was an excitement that the Obama administration’s approach to tech mirrored the blogosphere and early Twitter and how these companies saw themselves as fitting into the world,” he said. “The difference now is that, with Trump, it’s following the Republican Party’s lead,” he said. “Tech is watching Republican leaders and realizing that they have to get in the game. Otherwise, they’re going to be left out.” Previously Trump-skeptical tech companies such as Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are each giving at least $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, donations that Trump can use for whatever purpose he wants. Setting a tone near the top of the new administration will be Vance, who worked for one of Thiel’s venture capital funds, Mithril Capital, after law school and has benefited ever since from the association. Thiel was one of the main backers of Vance’s run for the Senate in Ohio in 2022. “From the top, you see that connection with Silicon Valley,” Leamer said. (He noted that Trump himself now qualifies as a tech investor, with a majority stake in the parent company of Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.) Leamer said that while some industries rely on Washington-based trade and lobbying organizations to be the faces of their businesses, figures such as Musk, Sacks and Thiel pursue a different model: cutting out the trade groups as middlemen and speaking directly to large audiences through social media and podcasts. “These are the people behind the microphone,” he said. “It’s fitting that these very famous people are now disintermediating the marketplace.” Trump’s choices for Cabinet-level nominations are generally people from political backgrounds, including members of Congress, Republican governors and campaign loyalists. But just below that level, tech figures are populating some of the most important positions. Jacob Helberg, an adviser to the government contractor Palantir Technologies and the husband of another ex-PayPal executive, Keith Rabois, is Trump’s pick for undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. A tech investor, Trae Stephens, a co-founder of the defense contractor Anduril and a partner at Thiel’s Founders Fund, has been under consideration for Defense Department jobs, according to Politico and The Wall Street Journal. Jim O’Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, is Trump’s choice for the No. 2 job at the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump has named Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, for the Pentagon’s top research job. Vance’s economic adviser Gail Slater, who has worked for Fox Corp., Roku and a now-defunct trade group called the Internet Association, is Trump’s choice to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. Announcing his choice of Slater on Truth Social, Trump highlighted the conflicts between large incumbent tech firms and the tech startups that have venture capitalists’ backing: “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump has also designated appointees friendly to the same tech faction to lead the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But there are hundreds or thousands of potential appointments still to come in the middle levels of the bureaucracy where other tech figures could end up. Vance said in a 2021 podcast interview that if Trump were to win another term, he should replace all federal civil servants with “our people,” meaning conservatives. Lalka, of Tulane University, said that for all the rhetoric about meritocracy coming from right-leaning tech entrepreneurs and investors, Vance’s vision for the federal workforce is more like the opposite. “That is literally ‘to the victor go the spoils’ from the 19th century,” he said. “It’s not how you attract top talent.” Malhotra, of Stanford, said one outstanding question is how many tech figures will take full-time jobs in government rather than part-time ones. Sacks’ White House role, for example, is expected to be part-time only, and Musk’s task of co-leading an efficiency commission also won’t be his day job. “That’s going to really limit their power,” he said of the part-time roles. “This is a really good way for Trump to marginalize these people and give them the facade that they’re powerful.” Despite his part-time role, though, Musk has lately left his imprint on the transition by helping block a government funding bill and globe-trotting with Trump to meet foreign leaders. There’s a long list of actions that Trump’s tech appointees are expected to tackle, including deregulation of the cryptocurrency industry, fewer constraints on artificial intelligence development, easier environmental approval for projects such as Musk’s SpaceX rocket launches, a shakeup in antitrust enforcement, an overhaul of military procurement and, with congressional approval, low tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals. Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of Chamber of Progress, a Democratic tech industry organization, said that despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in November, he’s trying to see potential upside for tech overall in part because of who’s advising Trump. “You have to go into the new administration with optimism,” he said. “A lot of these people who have supported Trump, they’ve supported Democrats in the past, so we’re not necessarily talking about people who are always in the Republican corner,” he said. Tech figures in that category include Musk, Sacks and investor Marc Andreessen, who recently said he’s spending half his time at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida advising on the transition. Kovacevich said he believes their alliance with Trump is best thought of as a narrow reaction against President Joe Biden, a longtime skeptic of the tech industry, rather than a complete rejection of Democratic politics. Kovacevich said he thinks Trump won’t be able to follow through on some of his most radical ideas about technology, including forcing social media platforms to further bend their content moderation in favor of conservative users. “Any efforts there will probably run into a First Amendment buzzsaw,” he said. One closely watched question: How much money will Trump’s tech allies make during his administration? Musk’s wealth has soared 70% since last month’s election, to about $450 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — fueling progressive theories that he and others in tech are motivated by a desire to increase their net worth. The stock price of Palantir Technologies, a government contractor, has roughly doubled since the election, and defense tech startup firms such as Anduril have also expressed optimism about increased sales during the new administration. Leamer, the Republican consultant, said he thinks Trump’s tech allies have a different motivation: to prove that they’re right. “I think they see it as a chance to put their ideas into practice,” he said. “These individuals have been thinking about these ideas, and they really have an interest in entrepreneurship and the future of the country.” CORRECTION (Dec. 26, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET): A diagram in a previous version of this article included a wrong photo.
